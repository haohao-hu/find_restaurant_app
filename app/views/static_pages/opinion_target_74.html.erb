Dae ( Korean style blood sausage) platter is served with good quality soon dae which are made on site with couple of pieces of sliced liver and lungs.</li><li>The Lingzhi Essence Jello ( $ 5.99) is quite sizable compare to the one served at Herbal Harmony but it is lacking the intense Lingzhi taste .. wondering it there is hardly any in it ?</li><li>The service was great and prompt, we did n't have to wait long to be seated and served.</li><li>As I was about to pay, a old lady ( looks like shes the manager or owner) realized I did not have tea, served it to me and apologized for having too much salmon in my dish.</li><li>Their perrogies are deep fried and quite delicious although i was surprised to find that they were served with hummus.</li><li>We were immediately served with tea, water and etc ... they are on top of things ...</li><li>The Spicy Chicken Dinner is served with a delicious citrus-laced salad and flavourful miso soup to start followed by a platter of skinless, spicy, saucy chicken on a bed of well-seasoned vegetables ( mainly onions).</li><li>Most dishes were served rapidly and in rapid succession.</li><li>If you 're going with a group I 'd recommend one of the sushi combinations that 's served on a boat.</li><li>This time, they had the added benefit of being completely tepid ( despite being warmed when I ordered- how ?), eaten at a filthy table, and served by someone who makes me question my commitment to social justice.</li><li>Came here again five weeks after their grand opening ( first time I came they had only been open `` fifteen days'' according to the cute host) and there 's the same quality food being served, absolutely fantastic service and no compromises in quality, taste, consistency.</li><li>The rotis are served on styrofoam plates or, for to go, in foil coated envelopes which keep them nice and hot.</li><li>It seems the food they cook in the morning is served till the evening.</li><li>No bread offered or served us, but the table which ordered pizzas was served with an abundance of bread, and presumably butter.</li><li>No bread offered or served us, but the table which ordered pizzas was served with an abundance of bread, and presumably butter.</li><li>And instead of your usual boring crumpet or English muffin, the Truffled Poached Eggs are served atop a mushroom ravioli and a delightful truffled Hollandaise sauce.</li><li>We all had drinks- the wine was great ( we ordered a some, although they also do BYOW, which is a plus) and I tried a Raspberry cocktail which was also great ( served in a mason jar with mint).</li><li>We found a manager to finally take our order, and told us it was a very busy evening ( so we were not being served, or checked on for an hour because of it ?).</li><li>My 10oz. prime rib was definitely at least 12oz. and most of their entrees are served with a mountain of fries ( or other sides you choose).</li><li>The servers were friendly, smiling and served us right away after we walked in.</li><li>The spicy mustard that went with the rye bread and the beef made the dish all the more salivating and I took home a pound of the corned beef following my meal ...... three homemade sandwiches later with Wolfie 's meat, I 'd still go back for more I quite liked the friendly man who served us the two times we went.</li><li>Great food with that home-cooked taste and served fast at a decent price!</li><li>Best Veal in town!: hell yea! tenderized, and full of flavor, not excessively breaded, not chewy, just perfecto! served with the al-dente spaghetti and marinara! que belissima! 4.5/5 Tartufo! 4/5 chocolata served with whipped cream, and crackers ..... great way to end off the dessert.</li><li>The Asparagus and Portabello Salad was delicious, served on a bed of mesclun lettuce with shaved Parmigiano and a white truffle vinagrette.</li><li>Perfectly cooked, and served with seasonal vegetables- this veal chop was so delicious.</li><li>I noticed all the staff that served our table spoke Mandarin which points to the clientele that come here.</li><li>Beef tataki sashimi, herb tuna sashimi or something like that, maguro hand roll .. actually hand roll because there 's too much rice, scallop sashimi- ordered ONE and it came out as a small plate unlike how the rest of the sashimi is served.</li><li>They are then grilled and served with all-purpose sauce ( hot sauce is also a must- just a bit of sriracha).</li><li>Fried strips of breaded chicken with light vinegar and served with their house sauce, which is just like soy sauce with vinegar and peppers.</li><li>Plus, it gets served in a little tea pot and you pour it into little shot glasses.</li><li>It 's wobbly pop, really, served in a tea pot.</li><li>A pot of tea is served wth each meal and the staff are quite attentive and are happy to take care of their patrons.</li><li>The rice on which it is served would be great too, if it were just a bit warmer.</li><li>They do not make traditional caribbean food and served the oxtail and rice and beans with cucumber instead of cabbage.</li><li>I originally got here, because I was looking for sushi at 11pm for some reason, and the served well even though we were last call.</li><li>The fried bananas with ice cream was served with tropical ice cream flavors- I recommend the coconut!</li><li>Although the flavour was nice, I felt this dish could have been served a little hotter as it was only lukewarm when it was served.</li><li>The Owners were at the event, and gave a brief description and/or history about the food being served.</li><li>The Owners have always been cheerful, with great memory, and served amazing food!</li><li>I think it would have been better with 50% less carrot and would be better served if they replaced that carrot with cucumber.</li><li>However, this was on a Monday afternoon lunch and there were only 3 other tables being served.</li><li>As for the duck wrap, it 's almost like Peking duck except it was deep fried to give it that extra crunch and it was served with lettuce for you to wrap it in.</li><li>There were a number of good things about the food being served.</li><li>The pita they served were store bought.</li><li>Not only was the food horrible and the price too high for what you get, but this place would be better served as a adult film store due to the bad lighting than a restaurant calling itself the `` Sunshine Spot''.</li><li>Replacing the peameal bacon with the regular streaky type came at no extra cost, but the hollandaise costs an extra $ 1.99 served in one of those small metal cups that often holds melted butter for lobsters.</li><li>The English muffins are served untoasted, so you 'll have to ask for them to be toasted in advance if you prefer them that way.</li><li>On the plus, the hubs ' eggs were served pretty perfectly poached.</li><li>Their food is very well priced and served fairly quickly, especially for such a busy place.</li><li>Food comes out fast, hot, and brusquely served, just like at every good Chinese restaurant.</li><li>We ordered the only thing at Joons that they 're famous for- Dak Gal Bee- and this dish is served in a large pan with the ingredients cooked at the table, so be prepared to wait awhile to eat, which is tortuous for incredibly hungry patrons.</li><li>Prior to our Seafood DakGalbee, side dishes were served.</li><li>Joon 's Special is the Dak Gal Bee ( a table-top burner with a large wok that cooks raw ingredients together) The cool thing about it is that unlike western restaurants, the food was cooked right at our table by our waitress instead of being served already cooked.</li><li>After the dumplings were served, they brought out plates of veggies ( green beans and spinach), then the rice and noodle dishes.</li><li>Never dissappointed, service can be hit and miss with duck being served before the pancakes and green onion and cucumber being served sparingly.</li><li>There is always at least 5-6 ducks being served every time I have been here, I have not tried the duck but it is craved at your table and in thin slices, always interesting to watch.</li><li>Your order is served at your seat along with water/cutlery. you can hep yourself for any other thing you need like seasoning etc.</li><li>The cranberry pecan french toast was priced as a brunch entree but served as a small dessert item.</li><li>Ordered: Porkbelly BBQ ( Sam Kyup Sal)* Pork belly BBQ served with mushrooms, onions and veggies for wrapping* You cook this on a BBQ grill at your table* Served with green onions and you can add it to your ' ssam' Green onions with chili powder and some vinegar for you to eat with the grilled meat Ordered: Marinated Beef ( Ju Mul Luk)* Beef mixed with veggies in a sweet sauce* I much prefer this over Bulgogi which I find it to be too sweet* This you also cook at your table with the grill Ordered: Kimchi Stew ( KimChi JjiGae)* It was interesting to see vermicelli in a Kimchi stew* The soup was just spicy enough and not too sour* Usually you eat this with a bowl of rice Ordered: Dumplings ( Mandoo)* These were Mul-Mandoo which means it is cooked in boiling water* You dip this into soy sauce Ordered: Spicy Soup ( Jjam Ppong Tang)* This is usually a noodle dish but this specific one was made without for drinking* It makes a nice dish to order when you are drinking soju* Filled with seafood and veggies Ordered: Seafood Pancake ( Hae Mul Pa Jeon)* There was n't much seafood in the pancake* I did n't really enjoy this Ordered: Spicy octopus &amp; pork* This is a table top cooking with veggies, octopus and pork* You can adjust the spiciness of this dish* Usually comes in 2 portions but we added an extra serving* Because there was so much food it did take a while to cook Conclusion: Now that I 've been back 3 times and tried couple things off their menu, I am convinced that even from their never-ending menu- they serve good Korean food.</li><li>Made with care and served in generous servings.</li><li>Most things are served either fried or with some kind of sweet sticky sauce.</li><li>If you 're looking for more traditional Chinese cuisine, you 're probably best served looking elsewhere.</li><li>It comes wraped in warm toasted pita with all the veggies and served with a delicious tahini sauce.</li><li>The crepe was just average, served with a light salad.</li><li>It 's a crepe filled with whip cream, bananas and brownie bits, sprinkled with icing sugar and drizzled with chocolate sauce on the outside, and served with two scoops of cookie and cream ice cream.</li><li>To finish off complimentary green tea ice cream was served.</li><li>The service is always fast and the food is consistently cooked well and served at very large portions.</li><li>The katsu was good ( served on the side and crunchy), but the udon soup was bland.</li><li>Food is served in a hot stone pot, that comes with rice ( and an egg that you crack into your pot for certain dishes).</li><li>My favourite is the Bulgogi soup which contains a yummy broth that has the right amount of sweetness and clear jap chae noodles that has an amazing texture, served with the usual obligatory Korean side dishes and purple rice.</li><li>$ 8 for a soup, with your choice of filling + tofu, served with a stone-pot purple rice which also doubles up as a second soup to cleanse off your palette after chowing down the hot, tasty broth.</li><li>My final tip: crack the raw egg in the bowl immediately the tofu bowl is served, then carefully spoon the molten hot soup over the egg to cook the egg whites but leave the yolk runny.</li><li>Our dishes were served limited banchans but two of were already my usual favorites- bean sprouts and black beans.</li><li>I only deducted 0.5 because the soup is sometimes on the salty side and the eggs they give you are extra tiny! `` everyone knows, when you go to Buk Chang 's, it 's for the soon tofu. unless you have a serious aversion to the texture of silk, do as the locals do and order one of the gloriously smooth tofu soups. they are THE BEST in the city! although, soon tofu is sometimes referred to as stew, it 's more like a light, flavourful broth with pieces of vegetables, tofu, and sometimes meat. it 's served piping hot, and in my opinion, best eaten in the colder months. hints: parking is in the back alley nearby subway is finch station, head south 2 blocks see jimi 's review of the toronto location at: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/buk-chang-dong-soon-tofu-toronto.</li><li>The best spicy tofu soup is served here.</li><li>Menu is tiny, only 9 food items, very limited # of drinks ... was looking for Korean BBQ ribs, none on the menu so I had the broiled BBQ beef which was good, served with a few side dishes, loved the dark little bean type item, not sure what it is though ???</li><li>The soon tofu is served with your choice of beef, seafood, or dumplings, and comes with a bowl of purple rice in a stone bowl.</li><li>Upon complaining, i was told that is the only way it is served despite the server confirming my request for med rare.</li><li>The service is fine, I like that the tea is served in the thermos pot which keeps it nice and hot and it is being constantly refilled with hot water.</li><li>Hot delicious food for 3 people, a bill under $ 40 served within 20 minutes on a busy Friday night deserves 6 stars, get 5 from the heading and 1 extra star here*.</li><li>Your burger and fries are served up quicker than Harvey 's can slide one out.</li><li>The waiter that served us would just dump the food on the table without saying a word and had a bad attitude the whole time.</li><li>The banchan ( side dishes) we were served were very good, the best of them was definitely the glass noodles which had a great flavour and texture, the kimchi was also good.</li><li>At which point she still took 2 other tables orders and served one table before coming back to us ???</li><li>Not the best dish but definitely a gokd value for the amount served.</li><li>The kabobs were served with saffron rice.</li><li>Unfortunately was served by the rudest waiter in my life who thought an attire and a misplaced pride can account for a lack of discipline, manners, or even language knowledge.</li><li>This was proper sushi, served properly.</li><li>Our three course meal was served.</li><li>Whether it was the Gindara, the chicken terriyaki, black sesame ice cream or being served by dainty and flighty Japanese waitresses dressed in Kimonos, Katsura could do no wrong.</li><li>After asking us for drinks we did n't get it until we prompted her again after our soup was served.</li><li>A few things happened that made me questions the professionalism of the staff: 1) The mug my coffee was served in looked like it have been rubbed against the hood fan in the kitchen before being served.</li><li>Came here for lunch on a Thursday afternoon and we were the only customers being served.</li><li>The staff was friendly and quick to take your order, however once your food is served you wo n't see your server again until you are done your meal.</li><li>I order the Pearl Rainbow Chopped in Crystal Fold that is minced pork and Chinese sausage mixed with mushroom, water chestnuts, celery and carrots and served with lettuce.</li><li>The lunch specials are served in bento boxes and your meat selection is served with sticky rice, cold noodles, a very small salad, and a slice of orange.</li><li>Next comes garlic bread which was delicious and very garlicky, next were salads which was a bunch of iceberg lettuce and a single slice of tomato, and finally was the entree, served with a choice of potato.</li><li>Then I saw one of the waitresses standing behind the cash register in the narrow aisle texting on her cell phone while I was directly in front of her without being served !!!</li><li>If individually ordered the Smoked Salmon would have been $ 16, served on a bed of romaine lettuce with cream cheese, capers, red onion, and rye bread.</li><li>Generous portions, tasty dishes, very reasonable prices for the amount and quality of food being served.</li><li>Beef and rice dish- served COLD ( well, not hot the way it should be), with mostly lumps of fat, hardly any meat; gross; 2.</li><li>It 's served all-day so we do n't need to rush.</li><li>The 2 mid to elder ladies prepped my meal and served it up with a smile.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
