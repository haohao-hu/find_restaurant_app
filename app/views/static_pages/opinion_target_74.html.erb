they are actually a won ton wrapper or a `` duck pastry'' as sold in Chinese supermarkets ( 10/ $ 1.99); our server called them `` pancakes''.</li><li>Their dumplings were okay but not awesome.</li><li>Next time we will order some of the lamb burger, boiled dumplings and soup noodle.</li><li>The noodles was great and we ordered dumplings and more noodles.</li><li>Also the bbq skewers ( lamb skewers so far are the best I ever had outside China and you can ask for less spices/chilly powder), fried stuffed pies, dumplings, noodle soup, sesame/bbq/fried lamb chops.</li><li>STEAMED LAMB DUMPLINGS These dumplings were so fresh and soupy.</li><li>I ordered dumplings they were stale and cold.</li><li>Shrimp dumplings `` Go for it.</li><li>Two portions for two people for lunch was more than sufficient, and even two portions for three people for dinner plus a side of dumplings was fine too.</li><li>I have tried their dumplings, dolsot bibimbap, soon tofu stew as well.</li><li>Dumplings tasted good.</li><li>What you need to know:- Do NOT order the dumplings- they tasted of freezer burn and were plated on stale cabbage.</li><li>I just remember the pot-sticker dumplings to be a bit disappointing- too thick skinned.</li><li>Is our go to place for dumplings until the next best one.</li><li>The good- dumplings, fried rice, noodles, and veggies.</li><li>We ordered several plates of dumplings, sadly most of them were pork ( my cousin ordered not realizing that my sister does n't eat pork or beef).</li><li>After the dumplings were served, they brought out plates of veggies ( green beans and spinach), then the rice and noodle dishes.</li><li>They have very nice dumplings and chicken dishes, I also love their green beans, I always order those and in this place they taste great.</li><li>We complement our meal with Hot and Sour soup, dumplings, fried rice, and the crispy beef.</li><li>I used to come here often in my younger years ( like single digit age) and the dumplings and Shanghai noodles were THE BEST.</li><li>It was really the only acceptable restaurant where you could eat dumplings and white bread with condensed milk.</li><li>Ordered: Porkbelly BBQ ( Sam Kyup Sal)* Pork belly BBQ served with mushrooms, onions and veggies for wrapping* You cook this on a BBQ grill at your table* Served with green onions and you can add it to your ' ssam' Green onions with chili powder and some vinegar for you to eat with the grilled meat Ordered: Marinated Beef ( Ju Mul Luk)* Beef mixed with veggies in a sweet sauce* I much prefer this over Bulgogi which I find it to be too sweet* This you also cook at your table with the grill Ordered: Kimchi Stew ( KimChi JjiGae)* It was interesting to see vermicelli in a Kimchi stew* The soup was just spicy enough and not too sour* Usually you eat this with a bowl of rice Ordered: Dumplings ( Mandoo)* These were Mul-Mandoo which means it is cooked in boiling water* You dip this into soy sauce Ordered: Spicy Soup ( Jjam Ppong Tang)* This is usually a noodle dish but this specific one was made without for drinking* It makes a nice dish to order when you are drinking soju* Filled with seafood and veggies Ordered: Seafood Pancake ( Hae Mul Pa Jeon)* There was n't much seafood in the pancake* I did n't really enjoy this Ordered: Spicy octopus &amp; pork* This is a table top cooking with veggies, octopus and pork* You can adjust the spiciness of this dish* Usually comes in 2 portions but we added an extra serving* Because there was so much food it did take a while to cook Conclusion: Now that I 've been back 3 times and tried couple things off their menu, I am convinced that even from their never-ending menu- they serve good Korean food.</li><li>Experience: Aside from their super miserable attitude, we sat at a cramped table next to their dumplings.</li><li>BUT the worst part is after we paid the bill and I got up to leave, the Korean lady was still sitting beside me making her freakin dumplings.</li><li>I 've tried a bunch of their other dishes including their dumplings, pork bone soup, tofu soup, jajungmyun, the deep fried chicken/pork with sweet &amp; spicy sauce and they 're all pretty decent!</li><li>They use a brand of chinese hot sauce to make it spicy ... it is the same chinese hot sauce my family uses for our dumplings.</li><li>Good comfort food- they mainly serve Korean tofu soup, comes with either seafood, dumplings, beef etc.</li><li>Many varieties of tofu soups to chosen from such as vegetarian, seafood, regular, and dumplings.</li><li>But only two ( amazingly delicious) dumplings.</li><li>The dumpling soon tofu soup was ok except it had a grand total of 2 dumplings and the rest was pretty much a mixture of tofu and broth.</li><li>The dumplings had a great crunch to them and the meat tasted spiced and juicy.</li><li>Their dumplings were n't different from the other locations, but ultimately, this did n't provide the dining mood.</li><li>We love to order the veggie dumplings ( I can have 6 alone!), siu lung bao or as I like to say `` little dragon bread'', green onion pancake, pan friend dumplings, fried rice, and many other things!</li><li>The waiter even said, look at the dumplings, they all like this.</li><li>So we did, and the dumplings was cooked and grey looking, not mushy and pink like the braised pork balls.</li><li>The food seemed to be made hastily, and if not, certainly delivered so, because the dumplings were all stuck together in one place.</li><li>We ordered the XLB, steamed dumplings, pan-fried dumplings, shanghai fried noodles, and stir-fried pea shoots for three people ( and yes, it was too much food).</li><li>The dumplings were quite good, about as good as you 'll get at most places, and they tasted home-made.</li><li>String beans with garlic- standard Pan fried dumplings- standard Shau mai- standard Soup dumplings- did n't try as they were eaten by the rest of the family before I had a chance to get one Soup dumplings with crab egg- good but not sure worth the additional price Beef noodle soup- I liked the broth as it was spicy and thick ( not watered down lacking flavor) and the meat was extremely tender falling apart as you bite Chicken with mango and onions- my brother described it as sweet and sour chicken with pureed mango.</li><li>The dumplings are delicious.</li><li>Menu consists of lots of things, but dumplings and Peking Duck are key.</li><li>I like their frozen dumplings, cheaper to buy it in T &amp; T.</li><li>The bento boxes include salad and dumplings.</li><li>I just sit there, try to look cute, and figure out how to eat more of the little dumplings than anyone else without looking like I 'm eating more than anyone else.</li><li>The mayo might have been for the small salad on the dish but it was so good w/ the dumplings!</li><li>They also have the standard pre-cooked appetizers-spring rolls, dumplings, some salads, deep fried stuff, etc-nothing special.</li><li>Wide selection on the grill-think stir fry but upgraded-although note to go easy on the chili paste if you are a spicy food lover like myself Wide selection of dim sum and appetizers, and great presentation, although some foods were not as authentic ( steamed veggie dumplings, kung pao fish, chicken fried rice) but guess they had to cater to different taste buds.</li><li>It 's a huuuuuuge Chinese-Canadian fusion buffet with really tasty food -- everything from North American staples like chicken balls and chow mein to more authentic steamed scallion buns and dumplings.</li><li>They 're man fried kinda like `` wo teep'' chinese dumplings but are kinda neat because they 're nice and tinyfor a perfect two bites.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
