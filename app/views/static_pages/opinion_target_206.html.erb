<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 206' %><h2>soup base<br />occurrence: 24</h2><div><ol><li>The soup base was pretty standard, but for some reason there was an after taste to it that I ca n't quite describe.</li><li>So, I came here with my dad for dinner and we ordered: Spicy beef noodle soup- Big enough for 2 to share,- generous amount of beef, but was not very tender- soup base was not spicy and needs to be more concentrated- noodles tasted plain, but pretty chewy Spicy lettuce- crunchy and juicy- absolutely drowned in chili oil ( which made it more spicy than the noodle soup)- presentation was very unappealing Sweet and sour chicken- this plate screamed MSG with its neon orange colour- suprisingly there was a lot of chicken meat instead of flour Overall: Like I said ...</li><li>The soup base was excellent, the meat was tender and the accompanying vegetables add greatly to the flavour of the soup ( my friend told me the those greens are the secret to most Vietnamese dishes, so do n't ditch them).</li><li>The soup base is not rich enough.</li><li>The soup base is amazing.</li><li>They give a good amount of noodles and beef, the soup base is very flavorful and every time I order this the quality is the same.</li><li>The soup base is tasty and a little bit spicy, the meat perfect.</li><li>The soup base was excellent and boy did it have a kick to it!</li><li>The soup base was absolutely disappointing!</li><li>The soup base was quite good.</li><li>The beef was overly tenderized &amp; the tripe was cut way too thin &amp; the soup base was a downer.</li><li>I ordered pho both visits, and honestly, whole heartedly ... the best soup base I have ever had in the city of Toronto.</li><li>They make a very good soup base.</li><li>I ordered the Chishan Mian and while I really liked the texture of the noodles, the soup base was just alright but there was barely any pork in the soup, which was quite disappointing.</li><li>I ordered the Soy Beef Stew Noodle Soup and thought their hand pulled noodles were good but the soup base was super super salty.</li><li>The soup base is key and though I wish they had fresh noodles, it 's not a deal breaker.</li><li>Authentic with great tasting slices of protein and the soup base is darling to taste buds and ass kicking remedy to every cold symptom imaginable.</li><li>So I think if anyone ordered a minimum of medium they would get a nice kick that will go well with the soup base.</li><li>But really, they all taste too similar as the soup base is the same.</li><li>With that said, do n't underestimate how good the soup base is.</li><li>I kind of wished it was put on the side so I can add it in myself and stir it because I kinda like it mixed with the soup base.</li><li>The soup base itself was VERY salty.</li><li>However, from what I can tell, I did n't detect any MSG related sensations when the soup base was plain so that 's a plus.</li><li>The pork bone soup is more expensive than other places ( $ 9.99 before tax)- the soup base was good, but the portions were not as impressive as other reviews claim.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
