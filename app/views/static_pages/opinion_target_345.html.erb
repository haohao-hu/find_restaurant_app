<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 345' %><h2>dinner menu<br />occurrence: 14</h2><div><ol><li>Came here for brunch &amp; ordered the dinner all you can eat option because i really wanted some sashimi &amp; dinner menu comes with quite a few hot dishes options that is n't in the lunch menu.</li><li>Judging by the dinner menu- it becomes pricey at night, but it 's one of the best lunch places in the area.</li><li>Their dinner menu looks great, maybe will try it next time.</li><li>The dinner menu is more expensive, but it also comes with more choice of food ( ie: salmon head, various other maki).</li><li>Lunch and dinner menu are great variety.</li><li>They also charged us for AYCE dinner when we did n't order anything from the AYCE dinner menu.</li><li>Maki were AAAMAZING- so little rice and they themselves were so small, very happy about that cuz I could try a bunch of different ones:) I recommend ordering the 4 piece special rolls under the dinner menu, they 're all fancy and pretty and I guarantee you will not be disappointed!</li><li>Of course, this is only during the dinner menu so this is just a FYI.</li><li>Went there for dinner on Thursday night, dishes on the dinner menu is very nice too.</li><li>OVERALL Good food, good enough to say that I would try their dinner menu soon.</li><li>I will say that the lunch menu is a bit smaller than most places, but their dinner menu is right up to par with the rest.</li><li>Dinner menu is the same old Cantonese cuisine with the addition of some abalone and shark fin soup ( knowing that some are morally against it, I 'm pointing it out).</li><li>I 'll definitely be back to try out the dinner menu!</li><li>Recommended for a special occasion as the dinner menu is definitely on the pricey side- but ambiance is great and good for bigger groups as well.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
