<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 740' %><h2>pho dac biet<br />occurrence: 5</h2><div><ol><li>They do other Vietnamese dishes well too and I 'm usually someone who likes to switch up my order, but every time I come here I just have to order pho dac biet.</li><li>I normally order the Pho dac biet and spring rolls because I enjoy being basic at times ... but hey, you ca n't go wrong with the Special, and without the spring rolls the meal just does n't seem complete.</li><li>I usually get a Pho Dac Biet, which has a little bit of everything thrown in a very tasty broth.</li><li>Most recommended dish will be obviously their pho dac biet ( special famous beef noodle soup) with all the works including thinly sliced beef, beef balls, beef shank, beef tendon ( mmm my favourite!) and noodle with lots of bean sprouts and mint.</li><li>Pho dac biet is definitely a staple for when you do n't know what to get.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
