<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 404' %><h2>onion<br />occurrence: 12</h2><div><ol><li>We ordered zucchini, onion, sausage and pepperoni.</li><li>The sausage was good quality and sliced, the zucchini was fresh and same was the onion.</li><li>We ordered the beef tenderloin with honey pepper sauce which was extremely tender and not too `` honey-ey'' and the chicken with dry onion which was perfectly spiced yet still juicy.</li><li>I highly recommend the whole steamed Tilapia and the green onion, mushroom wontons.</li><li>Ordered: Dak-Gal-Bee ( JS-1) 4/5* Chicken ( boneless dark meat) and assorted vegetables ( cabbage, sweet potato and greeon onion)* Choose your spiciness ( we went with B. The Joons Original Spicy Sauce)* $ 9.25 per portion ( 2 portions minimum), we ordered 3 portions for 3 people* Extra Add On: rice cake, mozzarella cheese, instant noodle, vegetables and fried rice* Extra add ons are all $ 2 except the fried rice* Everything is thrown together and comes to your table uncooked* Because it 's chicken, they take a while to fully cook and it drives you crazy* Servers will come around and cook them for you so do n't worry about the process* If you order mozarella cheese, they come midway and add it on near the end* For 3 portion order, I found there were n't much chicken* Original spicy sauce is not spicy at all !!</li><li>Grilled salmon was perfectly cooked, then unpredictably slathered in teriyaki sauce, and came with grilled and some less-grilled veggies- raw onion definitely wo n't impress a date.</li><li>Their sushi pizza is good as well ( excellent presentation wise), but could be improved if the rice was a little more fried and if it had green onion, caviar, and tobiko on it.</li><li>Five of the above-mentioned wrappers were served ( this is for 2 people and 2 duck legs, remember), along with four of the tiniest condiment dishes you can imagine, containing small amounts of cucumber, celery, shredded scallion ( green onion), and hoisin sauce.</li><li>The wrap for the duck was good but the cucumber and onion looked like it was prepped days ago and just kept in the fridge.</li><li>Then, we had an assortment of dishes including fried pork cutlets, fried green beans, tofu, beef and onion, Chicken with sprinkled garlic and for me, vegetarian dumplings ( but no meat).</li><li>I tried Korean fried chicken ( chicken with green onion [ Small ]) for the first time here ( their specialty), and it was delicious!</li><li>My impression of French onion was forever tainted after that time .. but Duncan House saved this dish for me.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
