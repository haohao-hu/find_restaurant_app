<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1271' %><h2>spicy salmon<br />occurrence: 3</h2><div><ol><li>The spicy salmon was okayyy just a normal salmon roll with a squirt of spicy sauce.</li><li>The spicy salmon was amazing ... first of all, the service was incredibly fast and the price was great ( $ 6.20 for 8 pieces).</li><li>I always get their Spicy Salmon, Tuna Sushi and Salmon Sushi combo for lunch for $ 5.99! ( yes, and that is like 8 pieces of sushi for that price) and sometimes when I feel like splurging a little for lunch, I order their spider roll for like $ 14.99 i think- which is like my favourite maki rolls and this place is generous when it comes to the soft shell crab they stuff in that shit.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
