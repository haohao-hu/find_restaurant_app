<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 371' %><h2>dine-in<br />occurrence: 13</h2><div><ol><li>They are a cash-only establishment that is open 7 days a week ( including holidays) with both dine-in and take-out options.</li><li>I called in a dine-in order once and it was n't ready on time when my family arrived at the restaurant.</li><li>Open kitchen means leave the ' dine-in' option in the summer as walking in with a Canada goose during winter can result to a pit stop at the dry cleaners pronto.</li><li>Never again. got take out from here for mother 's day dinner. called at 6.15, they said our order would be ready in 35 minutes. when we got there, everything was ready- good timely service, even during dinner on a holiday. i was impressed with that. ca n't say the same for dine-in, as there were many people waiting to be seated. that 's to be expected though. the food was pretty good. got the seafood super bowl congee ( much smaller portion compared to dine-in), bbq sparerib with honey ( these were eh- i swear they tasted better last time), vegetable with mixed mushroom ( eh- not enough mushrooms imo), snow pea leaves ( not sure what it 's called on the menu, but these were pretty good). overall everything was pretty average. not sure if the food was a bit lower quality since there 's such a big rush of customers on mother 's day ? i 've come here a couple times before and the food was definitely better. i 'd still come back though and recommend this restaurant.</li><li>There are only 3 tables for dine-in ... good luck.</li><li>Sushi is average not amazing but I rather go to other places if I want something more authentic and has more space for dine-in.</li><li>It has 3 tables for dine-in, but majority of the time the people who come in and out are those picking up takeout orders.</li><li>It gets to the point, cuts out the overly indulgent decor, no wait staff, barely a table to dine-in, very small overhead costs.</li><li>I 'm sure dine-in is probably nicer, but their food is of lower quality ( probably why it is so cheap).</li><li>Recently, I had a dine-in experience and portion sizes were standard.</li><li>I do n't think we 'll be coming back here for dine-in.</li><li>Particularly for lunch or dinner, dine-in ( they also do take-out).</li><li>For how expensive their pizzas are and after tipping them and paying extra for dine-in, this place does n't deliver on quality and value.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
