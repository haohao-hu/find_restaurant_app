<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 605' %><h2>cocktails<br />occurrence: 7</h2><div><ol><li>Definitely recommend trying some things from their drink menu, especially their martinis and cocktails.</li><li>Reallly good food and cocktails priced very reasonablly.</li><li>However, my experience with the 2 cocktails I ordered was poor enough such that I had to switch back to Guinness with all haste.</li><li>The prices of the cocktails were a touch higher than I would typically pay, but I guess I can understand this place has a certain level of prestige they are trying to uphold.</li><li>Speaking of price and prestige, as I said I can appreciate them attempting to set a certain bar, however, when I end up shelling out over $ 50 for a small-medium sized salad with a chicken breast and 2 cocktails, you 've got to get your head checked- ludicrous pricing.</li><li>Their Klondike chili is decent ( $ 7.49 with fries, $ 5.49 without), their cocktails are good, and I love their nachos with jalapenos, it 's really spicy and perfect for sharing while watching the game on their many tv screens ( $ 11.99).</li><li>Word to the wise, avoid cocktails or mixed drinks here.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
