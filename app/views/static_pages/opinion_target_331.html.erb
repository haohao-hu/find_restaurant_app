<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 331' %><h2>dough<br />occurrence: 15</h2><div><ol><li>What I like about Pizza Pizza is the dough.</li><li>The dough is what makes this pizza stand out.</li><li>The gluten-free dough needs some work, but this of course is a problem Pizza Nova-wide.</li><li>All their pizza is wood oven, and i 've tried traditional, milano, Calabrese and all their dough was nicely done, love the thin crust and they are generous on their toppings.</li><li>They did n't skimp on the cheese, but the dough could have been a little more cooked in the middle ( of mine, anyway).</li><li>Liked the dough- fluffy and fresh.</li><li>Over all, a nice place but if we come back, we 'll be sure to order something different next time! ok it 's no fluke the wood oven pizza here is very good. ( we ordered two kinds to try) the dough, sauce and cheese the base ingredients of most any pizza are top notch. the crust i would describe .. it 's not a thin where it 's paper thin and it 's not cooked crisp like I 've had at many other thin crust pizza places. having its so crisp hides the true identity of the pizza dough. how can one taste the crust if it 's burnt !? the crust is thin where one can bite into the dough know it 's dough and not thick enough to not overwhelm the toppings. my quattro stagione was made wrong though .. it suppose to be separate quarters of pizza with the individual toppings. but instead it was a pizza with all the toppings. c 'mon just because I do n't look italian does n't mean I do n't know how it 's suppose to be. do n't give me stupid excuses that things get roughed up in the oven that why that make it that way ? i do n't care for the chatty waitress here and the ridiculous excuses, but as i mentioned in my first review. i will come here for the food because the cooks and chefs in the back know what they are doing ..</li><li>I had a meat burek, which is kind of like a coil of sausage wrapped in an oily dough.</li><li>However the dough was chewy.</li><li>Common problems of momos: dry, hard dough, not enough meat, too saucy meat, not saucy enough.</li><li>The dough was thick and dry but the filling was still juicy.</li><li>The dough was soggy when it arrived and it really destroys the texture of the pizza.</li><li>You would think the dough would be crispy since it comes out of a wooden oven but it was an utter disaster.</li><li>The dough was too sticky, and underseasoned.</li><li>The dough that they use just does n't appeal to me and it kind of seems like they leave the pizza in the oven a little longer to burn the dough a little more.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
