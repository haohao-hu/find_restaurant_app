( The seafood is fresh and delicious too) I ca n't really recommend anything specific as I 've tried pretty much everything on the menu and nothing has disappointed me.</li><li>Ordered the seafood udon it was good but the seafood with tiny and they do n't give you much.</li><li>The seafood version uses frozen seafood, so the texture is a bit lacking, but you ca n't really expect fresh at these prices.</li><li>The seafood version uses frozen seafood, so the texture is a bit lacking, but you ca n't really expect fresh at these prices.</li><li>I also ordered the seafood and wintermelon congee.</li><li>Fried rice average but I liked that it was not oily and they were generous with the seafood.</li><li>Absolutely delicious with just the right amount of ginger shreds to accentuate the freshness of the seafood.</li><li>Food: 3.5 stars I ordered the seafood special of the day for $ 19.99.</li><li>The seafood special consists of deep fried shrimp, calamari, and battered cod or halibut ( l forgot).</li><li>Another thing is I would have appreciated less salt on both the seafood and pork chops.</li><li>The JS-2 Dak Gal Bee ( chicken &amp; seafood) was what I ordered in this visit.</li><li>Linguine Pescatore- very generous with the seafood and the pasta is always cooked a perfect al dente Excellent service, great atmosphere, take- out, menus available for parties/special occasions &amp; open for lunch!</li><li>It featured good quality pasta, and an assortment of well-cooked seafood, including scallops, shrimp, crab, clams and mussels.</li><li>It might 've been the ' seafood creole' but I swear I would have never ordered any dish that contained the word ' creole'.</li><li>There was an okay amount of seafood mixed in here and there, but honestly ... gigantic plate of beansprouts.</li><li>There was an abundance of seafood which includes squid, shrimp, clams, white fish ... etc.</li><li>The broth was a bit on the salty side, but other wise perfect, with large pieces of meltingly soft tofu as well as seafood and pork.</li><li>The soup was very orange in colour and of adequate spice level, but lack much seafood taste in itself.</li><li>Spicy Seafood Hot Pot ( $ 14.99)- If you are into fish, you would love this dish- If you are hungry, you would be stuffed- If you are into noodles, you will be in heaven- I wish this is more spicy- This definitely not that live seafood hot pot I had before with all those seafood tossed in alive .. but good enough at this price!</li><li>Spicy Seafood Hot Pot ( $ 14.99)- If you are into fish, you would love this dish- If

tossed in alive .. but good enough at this price!</li><li>I think I might prefer the seafood one better.</li><li>It was fairly spicy and surprised it also had good amounts of seafood in the stew as well.</li><li>The noodle was cooked just right, the soup spicy enough for `` a kick'' but notind numbingly so, and they did not skimp on the seafood, as many other places often do.</li><li>We shared a bottle of the Sangiovese Montepulciano, IL Brecciarolo ( Italy) which was a lighter red which was so good on its own and great for pairing with the seafood.</li><li>My seafood fettuccine had seafood in it, but it just did n't have the seafood flavour.</li><li>My seafood fettuccine had seafood in it, but it just did n't have the seafood flavour.</li><li>Perhaps the seafood was from frozen, or the cream sauce did n't have any seafood juices in it.</li><li>Definitely recommend this.the seafood curry comes in an actual coconut, and not just an emptied out coconut shell.</li><li>Instead of tasting like coconut, it tasted more of the seafood stock it was based on and was kind of off putting when you were expecting coconut milk because it was in the title of the dish.</li><li>This one was creamy to the right extent and the seafood was to die for.</li><li>We had the seafood curry baked in a coconut and the Pad Thai.</li><li>Would definitely go for the regular Beef special pho and spring roll if not up for seafood.</li><li>My mom ordered the seafood udon soup which had very little taste and the `` seafood'' was minimal and most probably came out of a freezer bag.</li><li>All the seafood is decent.</li><li>I went for dinner with my in laws hoping to get a nice seafood dinner after reading some good reviews about the food.</li><li>One thing I found out is if you want a candle for your butter you have to ask or they will bring it in a little cup ( if your a seafood fan you want the piping hot butter) My meal comes my crab is cut into small pieces witch I am not a fan of Prefer the whole legs ( personal preference) they were cooked perfect.</li><li>I 've been to way more expensive seafood places but they 've also served way better seafood.</li><li>Now, if you 're interested in getting a real seafood experience, i.e. digging into the seafood and not just eating the claw/tail of the lobster, then go here!</li><li>Now, if you 're interested in getting a real seafood experience, i.e. digging into the seafood and not just eating the claw/tail of the lobster, then go here!</li><li>If you 're not open minded enough to try eating the body of the lobster or would like to stick to seafood that does n't really look like seafood, then go to Red Lobster.</li><li>Adding to what is becoming a bad dinner night, sauces for seafood and baked potato came in disposable ketchup cups that you see at McDonald 's; they said they ran out of those ' aprons' to cover your shirt when eating lobster; and they also happened to run out of lobster cutters as well.</li><li>I know seafood is expensive, but for the high price I 'm paying and the small portion I get, I expect some kind of uniqueness and exceptional quality in the food and good service from the servers.</li><li>The market price for 1 lb of crab legs was $ 63 and they were water logged because they had been previously frozen.Our waitress neglected us entirely, bringing our meals out at different times ... our sides did n't show up until we were halfway through our seafood and we had to ask for drink refills and missing items.</li><li>I definately liked the steamed more simply because I think by steaming your seafood it just allows the natural flavours to shine more, which it did.</li><li>Overall: Seafood is fresh, but it 's $ $ $!!^_^!</li><li>I recommend the super congee w/ all the seafood in it.</li><li>The food was awesome and the seafood was off the hook.</li><li>The congee tasted very smooth and yummy because it cooked with roasted bbq duck and seafood.</li><li>The Crab and seaweed salad and the seafood and veggie wrap.</li><li>The seafood and veggie wraps were good too.</li><li>The seafood in the bowl is always tender and never fishy.</li><li>My next favorite dish is the Seafood and mixed vegetable Taiwanese vermicelli.</li><li>We had to go out for a walk since our tummies were so happy. house special congee. salt pepper squid. seafood udon. tomato and coconut milk rice and shrimp. bbq duck with noodle. server was helpful when we ordered two bowls of congee to share so we took her suggestion and only got one bowl since we got so much other food.</li><li>I always order seafood and bean curd soup, BBQ pork rice noodle rolls, Cantonese chow mein, rice noodle with beef and black bean sauce with vegetables and spicy fries squid.</li><li>Congee Queen has a huge menu and lots of delicious options to choose from that range from vegetarian, seafood &amp; fish to all sorts of meats!</li><li>We ordered 2 seafood soontufus and 1 kimchi jjigae.</li><li>JS2 [ Chicken &amp; Seafood ( Shrimp, Mussel, Squid) Dak Gal Bee ] Add-on: Rice Cake ( $ 2.00) + Steam Rice ( $ 1.75 ?)</li><li>After our Dak Gal Bee ( chicken, veggies, with extras of rice sticks, sweet potato and seafood) was mostly done, our waitress added white rice and made a delicious fried rice dish on the wok using the remaining sauce.</li><li>We were a party of four, so we got two portions of the seafood and chicken versions, topped with their original sauce, mozzarella cheese, and rice cakes.</li><li>I recommend getting the Seafood Dakgalbee, which comes with chicken ( boneless dark meat), assorted seafood ( baby octopus, shrimp, mussels), and cabbage.</li><li>Ordered the hot stone bowl with seafood, tofu and spicy broth.</li><li>The fried rice aside, for two portions of seafood dak gal bee, there was only 1 mussel.</li><li>None of the seafood in it was actually fresh.</li><li>Includes some seafood like mussels and squid.</li><li>The haemul ( seafood) pajeon was uncooked in the middle, with little unpleasant pockets of batter around the seafood pieces.</li><li>For $ 45 the meal came with the beef sirloin, two bowls of purple rice, lettuce wrap, seasoned lettuce, onion pancake, an assortment of 8 side dishes and a bowl of seafood soon tofu soup.</li><li>Food: I was craving something warm so I order a kalbitang ( beef soup), and my group had a jajangmyung ( korean black bean noodles), o-dengtang ( fishcake soup), and dwenchang chigae ( seafood and tofu soup).</li><li>It 's like seafood Alfredo with Rice cakes and udon.</li><li>They also have different variations of Soontofu/Soondubu- kimchi, seafood and I believe pork.</li><li>I usually get the vegetarian or the seafood, but I usually do n't eat the shrimps in the seafood because they are whole shrimps including eyes still on them, which I am not a fan of.</li><li>I usually get the vegetarian or the seafood, but I usually do n't eat the shrimps in the seafood because they are whole shrimps including eyes still on them, which I am not a fan of.</li><li>The usual dishes we often order are: seafood soon tofu, kimchi soon tofu, bbp, soybean soon tofu and bulgogi.</li><li>Flavorful soup, silky tofu, seafood, perfectly cooked rice, freshly cracked eggs half cooked in the soup, plus the water soaking the flavor of burned rice bottom on the stone bowl, it 's a perfect combination of flavors and texture.</li><li>Good comfort food- they mainly serve Korean tofu soup, comes with either seafood, dumplings, beef etc.</li><li>I also had a bit of my friend 's seafood soon tofu which was also delicious, served with shrimp ( head on) and mussels ( they were out of oysters on this night).</li><li>I tend to go for the seafood soon tofu.</li><li>If you order the seafood, the ingredient list is oyster, mussel, and shrimp.</li><li>Many varieties of tofu soups to chosen from such as vegetarian, seafood, regular, and dumplings.</li><li>Seafood Soon Tofu- I chose the regular spicy level ( you can choose to have it not spicy) and found that it was n't spicy enough this time.</li><li>Onto the food:- the meat and brisket they serve with the soup is delicious, however I found the broth a bit bland- purple rice is very very good. i had the seafood soon tofu.</li><li>Could have used fresher seafood.</li><li>I got the Seafood Soon Tofu and my friend got the Dumpling Soon Tofu.</li><li>I would go again if I were craving soon tofu but I would like to try out the bulgogi there as well. this stuff is addictive .. simple menu, u just pick either the soup or the meat, or bibimbop ... and go from there .. but i tell u, whatever u choose u wo n't regret .. i had bibimbop and soft tofu soup with the seafood .. was fantastic .. i was so full but had to finish everything .. was that good .. usually packed so def recommend going off peak time ..</li><li>There are only a few menu 's here, beef, mixed, seafood, bean paste ' soon tofu', comes with stone bowl rice and ' noo roong ji' afterwards. bi bim bap, bul gogi and some others which most of them are pretty good.</li><li>Had seafood soon tofu there.</li><li>The soon tofu is served with your choice of beef, seafood, or dumplings, and comes with a bowl of purple rice in a stone bowl.</li><li>There was no visible seafood- probably all dissolved in the soup.</li><li>Even when my friend- who is severely allergic to fish &amp; seafood- advised them of this concern they were unable to fully confirm whether or not their kimchi used any seafood ( which traditionally, kimchi does).</li><li>Even when my friend- who is severely allergic to fish &amp; seafood- advised them of this concern they were unable to fully confirm whether or not their kimchi used any seafood ( which traditionally, kimchi does).</li><li>Love the seafood flavor of the spicy broth and all the side dishes.</li><li>Thirdly, i got the seafood soon tofu, and there were two dried out shrimp too hard to get off the shell, one mussel and a couple of small shrunken oysters.</li><li>I 've had much seafood soon tofu soup at innumerable Korean restaurants but none stands out quite like this one; their broth is very aromatic with the kick of heat.</li><li>- Good Order:- Bulgogi soup + Hot Stone Pot Rice- Seafood Soon Tofu + Hot Stone Rice Not my first choice of restaurant when I 'm craving for soon tofu.</li><li>The seafood soon tofu soup was good.</li><li>I personally do n't like too much tofu so the seafood balanced it out pretty well.</li><li>We each ordered miso soon du bu extra spicy, seafood soon du bu regular spicy and a bulgogi pot for my daughter.</li><li>When our order arrived, they had mixed up our order and made the seafood soon du bu extra spicy and the miso soon du bu regular spicy.</li><li>Anyone could see that the seafood soon du bu was the alarmingly red indicating the spicy level.</li><li>The seafood soon tofu is a must try.</li><li>They have plenty of seafood, zucchini and tofu.</li><li>The tofu is silky and is complimented by different meats, seafood and veggies.</li><li>It has a great taste of seafood and not the harsh over salted flavour of the KimChi one.</li><li>My personal preference is combination 1/ 2 because I love seafood.</li><li>I always get the seafood option.</li><li>My friend ordered the seafood soon tofu ( extra spicy) while I had the kimchi soon tofu ( regular spicy).</li><li>For $ 9 do n't expect too much seafood.</li><li>We ate there last week and my wife and daughter both got food poisoning from the seafood.</li><li>The Bouillabaisse is not seafood based soup but tomato paste with seafood dumped in.</li><li>You have the rosti, pasta, burgers, sandwiches, seafood, and desserts.</li><li>The food is borderline passable in general with the soup being quite tasty however their seafood section leaves something to be desired.</li><li>Wish there were less `` popular'' choices of cuisine like burgers, steaks and seafood.</li><li>Had the dry seafood noodle and it hit the spot!</li><li>I had the seafood in blackbean sauce and it has lots of veggies which I liked but only a bit of seafood.</li><li>Because my curry did not come with rice ( I realize some places make you order rice seperate, which is annoying, so I only blamed myself for not remembering to ask if I needed to order rice), I tried to use some of his noodles, and I am vegetarian so I went to pick out the bits of meat and seafood.</li><li>Fresh food, good quality rice, fresh seafood ( hwae/sashimi) and almost friendly service.</li><li>The seafood was incredibly tasty and fresh- you do not have to worry about any `` fishy'' tasting foods ( although ironically, what you 're eating is fish but it 's not supposed to taste fishy ... go figure).</li><li>It had excellent flavour with lots of Seafood but little on the veg side.</li><li>Decent amount of seafood.</li><li>It seems that the menu is geared towards impressing the Chinese palette for fresh seafood ( i.e. lobster, crab), which- as a herbivore- I ca n't say too much about.</li><li>I used to think that I could n't like this restaurant, as the food is `` traditional'' ( i.e. outdated, boring) steak + seafood throwing-everything-under-a-broiler type, and I am not super comfortable having senior citizens wait on me.</li><li>We tried their rib eye, peppercorn, seafood delight, and duckling all of which were all very flavourful.</li><li>Pick your meat ( pork, lamb, beef, chicken or several different kinds of seafood), veggies ( plenty of options), noodles ( 3 varieties) and sauce ( large selection of pre-mixed or create your own) and hand your bowl to the cook who has it ready for you in a minute or so after tossing it around on a huge hot plate with no oil, just water.</li><li>I have been here for lunch a few times with groups from work and I think they have something for everyone- seafood, veg, different meats, styles and spice.</li><li>I am one of many who love the Mongolian Grill concept, where you pick your own ingredients, meats or seafood, add tons of fresh veggies, plus noodles, sauces, and condiments, and hand your choices off to the chefs who will sizzle it up for you, on their 700 degree flat top.</li><li>I had the noodles with beef, lamb and seafood with a meddly of vegetables.</li><li>Also if your a seafood lover, you 'll get your dose.</li><li>First, the seafood in the congee was extremely small and scarce.</li><li>We love the seafood superbowl cogee with fried dough fritters, seafood chow mein, fried noodle with beef and bean sprouts, deep fried shrimp wontons, deep fried squid tentacles and yang chow fried rice.</li><li>Obviously coming to COngee Wong we both decided to order their popular Chef 's Big Bowl Congee which had a variety of seafood.</li><li>Some good bets: yeung chow fried rice, house seafood and mixed vegetable fried rice, and seafood super bowl congee.</li><li>We ordered two bowls of congee ( seafood and fish) and several Chinese dishes ... one of which is my new favorite: special fried turnip cake.</li><li>The seafood are fairly fresh but Im not a fan of the drenched sauce and the lobster was covered with starchy and chewy greasy tempura bits which I always hate.</li><li>Prix Fixe Menu ( $ 25)- Baby Arugula Salad ( tons of goat cheese)- Veal Chop ( over cooked and dry but with tons of veggie on the side)- Tiramisu ( creamy and tasty) and- Caesar Salad ( fresh and crispy with the right amount of dressing)- Linguine Pescatore ( tons of seafood, huge scallops !!!)- Chocolate Cake ( meh ... skip !!)</li><li>Pros: Butter Chicken is above average Cons: Portions are small Do n't order anything seafood I do n't crave Indian often, so I 'm not a pro when it comes to Indian food.</li><li>The menu is quite extensive and offers all kinds of meats like Chicken, Beef, Lamb and even seafood platters.</li><li>It 's a complex broth that has hints of seafood, pork, and msg.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
