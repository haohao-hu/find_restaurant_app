<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1120' %><h2>seating arrangement<br />occurrence: 3</h2><div><ol><li>The host needs to read the note more carefully and actually execute the seating arrangement to her best ability, instead of just shrugging us off and seating us somewhere crappy by the washroom ( no pun intended).</li><li>I was really looking forward to some meat, so I was n't about to let a rude host, or uncomfortable seating arrangement put a damper in my evening!</li><li>My favorite six grains and assorted fungus congee does not have as many of six grains as there are at Congee Queen, and I 'd rather pay few cents more for my extra grains:)) The decor is also a lot simpler and more generic and the seating arrangement is not the greatest with booths lining the sides and round tables put just in front of the entrance, so new customers literally stand over the eating patrons.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
