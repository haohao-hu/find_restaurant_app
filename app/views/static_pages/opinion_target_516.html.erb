<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 516' %><h2>seaweed<br />occurrence: 7</h2><div><ol><li>My problem is I find them to be a little snobby, the sushi sucks ( does not taste fresh seaweed always like rubber) and they are a little over priced on both drinks and food.</li><li>The seaweed that wrapped around the sushi was a bit chewy and some pieces were quite big to fit into one bite.</li><li>My only complaint about the banchan was the seaweed and japchae were way too salty and the daikon tasted funky.</li><li>You get small round dishes with bean sprouts, cold potatoes in gooey sweet sauce, glass noodles, kimchi, fish cakes, seaweed ( not like you get at sushi places, this one is saltier, with more of a sea-taste to it) and little bean dish.</li><li>The seaweed on the handroll did not have the typical crispiness, it was hard to bite off.</li><li>There was glass noodles, seaweed, kimchi, fish cake, bean sprouts, etc.</li><li>The side dishes selection was not as large as some other places, but they did have seaweed and fish cakes so I 'm not complaining.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
