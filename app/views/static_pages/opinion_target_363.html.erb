<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 363' %><h2>noodle soup<br />occurrence: 13</h2><div><ol><li>The waitress realized that we were sharing that noodle soup, not only she got us an extra bowl ... she have the extra bowl filled with the broth!</li><li>We were offered complimentary tea and noodle soup.</li><li>FOOOOOOD: They give you complimentary noodle soup which was great, very tasty and it 's a good size to start off with.</li><li>We ordered the crunchy noodle soup, take sushi dinner and the sunset action maki roll.</li><li>The waiter always brings complimentary noodle soup, and finishes the meal with a cold cinnamon ginger tea for digestion.</li><li>I had a fruit fly in my soup in my clam based noodle soup.</li><li>The restaurant is great, the noodle soup is definitely one of the best in Toronto IF not the best.</li><li>Also the bbq skewers ( lamb skewers so far are the best I ever had outside China and you can ask for less spices/chilly powder), fried stuffed pies, dumplings, noodle soup, sesame/bbq/fried lamb chops.</li><li>What I ended up doing though is dunk pieces of skewer lamb into their handmade noodle soup so it made the soup a little spicier and the meat itself is now perfect.</li><li>Sour and spicy noodle soup- I ordered this, looks spicy but it was n't spicy at all ...</li><li>Overall, it was a nice noodle soup but nothing too spectacular as they seemed to have some meh toppings.</li><li>It was like ordering water off the menu for $ 8.99 because the soup was like water, no flavour at all, chicken broth i got in my noodle soup was certainly less than an ounce which is really misleading and annoying.</li><li>My main complaint is that the price is not worth the quantity of food you get as if you come in here hungry you will not leave full and especially for noodle soup, this is not a good thing!</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
