<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 171' %><h2>shawarma<br />occurrence: 30</h2><div><ol><li>Definitely will recommend this spot to anyone on the hunt for good shawarma.</li><li>I did find the chicken shawarma to be a bit dry.</li><li>Highly recommend their shawarma, be warned though.</li><li>He was n't playing around ........ this is BY FAR the best shawarma I 've EVER had !!!</li><li>The two stars are for him:) The shawarma was not seasoned well and the rice was horribly waterlogged.</li><li>The smell when you walk in is amazing but the shawarma itself never seems to measure up.</li><li>From someone who eats shawarmas at least once or twice every month, take it from me that this place has the worst shawarma I 've had in Canada.</li><li>Positives about this place ?- cheap shawarma- can sit outside- open late.</li><li>The only thing that gives their shawarma taste is their thina and the hot sauce.- pitas are the cheap, paper-thin variety. they use them as a wrap, not as a pita ' pocket' style.- falafel actually is worse than the shawarma ( I think they make it in the morning, and just serve it throughout the day)- owner ( or one of the owners ?), when he works, has 0 customer service skills. not pleasant to deal with The fact that this place is around proves the mantra ' location-location-location'.</li><li>To top if off when I got back into my car with the food, I realized he did n't even toast the shawarma and the whole thing was cold including the meat ( luke warm).</li><li>The shawarma is moist and flavourful, balanced nicely with the pickles and sauces.</li><li>Best shawarma for the price and quality!</li><li>One suggestion would be is to get the shawarma toasted a bit longer for the crunch, but all in all great quality!</li><li>The chicken in the shawarma was very good.</li><li>I always get the shawarma in a pita and its so good!</li><li>Ive always been a fan of good shawarma and falafel but unfortunately even though the middle eastern population in toronto is quite large, there arent many contenders.</li><li>Honestly, this is the best shawarma I 've tryed in Toronto.</li><li>Do n't miss the best shawarma in Toronto, it 's a really huge pita with a different taste, very delicious, very delicious.</li><li>The food is great--we 've never branched out from the sandwiches, but the shawarma and falafel are crispy and flavourful and there are plenty of pickled toppings available to tart up the sweet tahini and garlic sauces.</li><li>Great shawarma ?</li><li>Liked the shawarma, better than paramount.</li><li>When we asked the lady at the cash questions about the chicken shawarma she did n't explain to us and plainly pointed to the sign in front of the cash for the toppings and stuff.</li><li>I usually order the vegetable plate with meat- the shawarma is always on point and never fatty or gristly; falafels are fresh and tasty and the hummos and baba ghanough are the best I 've ever had.</li><li>The vegetarian combo with meat ( hehe, funny name) is really good, where you get to try the dips, the tabouleh, the falafel, as well as a shawarma of your choosing ( the shawarma was so-so, but hey, if you gotta have meat ...).</li><li>My friend 's shawarma came with large pieces of white meat chicken, the chicken was slightly dry and not crispy on the outside ( as shawarma should be), but it did have a pretty good flavour.</li><li>The side of rice pilaf with the shawarma was quite good, very buttery and cooked well.</li><li>The shawarma was packed with meat, to the point where it was over spilling, and not one bite was dry or flavourless.</li><li>Unfortunately, my shawarma was very dry and relatively tasteless though which was disappointing.</li><li>Had the shawarma, was ok.</li><li>I kind of wish they would give us more varieties on the shawarma.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
