<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 113' %><h2>table<br />occurrence: 49</h2><div><ol><li>Does n't take long to get a table and our server returns often asking if we 're ok, or to refill drinks, bring napkins etc.</li><li>We went on a week-night, and contrary to the massive warnings about `` having to reserve a table'', we had no problem getting a table on the day of, and there were an ample amount of seatings.</li><li>Note to self: Next time I 'm out on a Yelp event and Devan R. is seated at a table, I want the seat next to one of my newest fave foodies at Yelp.</li><li>The process of the line-up and getting a table is a bit frustrating, which is not what I want on my weekend.</li><li>The wait time to get a table was probably around 10 minutes and the wait time for our food was about 10 minutes as well.</li><li>I have visited the place more than 50 times and I keep wondering how they manage to always keep around the most professional of service staff, I took 4 of my office associates out for lunch and we each ordered a drink, an appetizer and a main course, waitress serving us memorized each of our orders without writing it down, while some upscale places have up to 3 people serving a table of five and would still manage to misplace or confuse an item or two per order.</li><li>We were able to get a table right away and they let us sit outside until close.</li><li>Fortunately, a table was leaving right when we arrived so we got a nice booth by the window.</li><li>Self serve on the coffee or drinks and grab a friend or a table and enjoy.</li><li>We booked a table 4 days in advance and when we arrived we were told that our table had been given away.</li><li>There was two ladies at a table when we arrived, very quiet.</li><li>Service was good the waitress girl who served our table was nice.</li><li>Came on a Saturday night just past 8pm, and waited around 15 minutes for a table for three.</li><li>I can always get a table here and the staff is really friendly.</li><li>The table was pretty small.</li><li>Although our table questioned the lack of potatoes ( even when it said potato pork bone soup in Chinese on the wall menu) the waitress gave some weird explanation in English that no one understood.</li><li>The chef makes his rounds non-intrusively table to table to see if his guests are enjoying their food.</li><li>Their table was SO close to ours like how hard is it to give us our food too ?</li><li>We waited for at least 30mins and all we had on our table was water ...</li><li>They tend to cook at one table and bring the pan to you later ... not cool: (- if you 're getting the entrees which they cook in front of you, you have to order 2 of the same dish which generally leads to less choice/variety- they only accept debit or cash I actually did n't realize this until lately, but what they cook in front of you can be easily replicated at home.</li><li>It 's small compared to those in Richmond Hill/Markham, but if you 're able to get a table it 's pretty good.</li><li>They have 2 table which seats 2 and 4 but it 's whoever comes first takes the seats.</li><li>We came here on a friday night for dinner, the place looks empty with only one table, luckily we were able to get a table to sit at.</li><li>It gets to the point, cuts out the overly indulgent decor, no wait staff, barely a table to dine-in, very small overhead costs.</li><li>Went there the first time around 3pm, thinking it will be easy to get a table in between meals.</li><li>By this time, another couple had sat down at a table and had placed their order.</li><li>After a failed first attempt to land a table, the second attempt was not much better.</li><li>What I do recall is waiting for a table at lunch ( about 15-20 minutes) and watching a lot of white and Asian people come out of the restaurant.</li><li>The place was busy so we shared a table with another patron which is fine.</li><li>However the table was quite small and made our eating space quite tight ... maybe we should have only ordered one type of dish.</li><li>We had to walk all the way to the back of the restaurant and asked for everything that we needed, table, water, food .... our server wasnt friendly and got some attitudes.</li><li>Seating is super limited so it 's really hard to get a table if there 's a group of u.</li><li>Make sure you have a reservation, and come 10 minutes prior to your requested time so you get a table a.s.a.p as this place is often crowded around the dinner time rush.</li><li>I would go early, we had to wait a bit to get a table, but once you 're in service is super quick.</li><li>My friends and I came at a really good time because a table was just leaving.</li><li>The place is small and sitting by 2 we basically shared a table with the people next to us.</li><li>Your only real concern is being able to get a table during busy hours.</li><li>We arrived around 7:30pm and there was a short wait per usual, but we get a table relatively fast.</li><li>Each teppanyaki grill had eight seats and we were seated at a table with another family.</li><li>Nevertheless, we were lucky enough to score a table despite the owner having immense false insight that our bill would fall short compared to the group of beer thirsty fans behind us in line.</li><li>We called to make a reservation 15 minutes before arrival and they told us that the place was pretty empty- we should get a table with no problem.</li><li>They are always busy but never packed ( except Sunday from 10-12) so we never have an issue getting a table and the service is always fantastic.</li><li>If you are staying in the adjacent Westin it would n't be a bad choice but do n't expect too much and if you are alone I 'd sit away from the grill and enjoy a quiet table with sushi.</li><li>We were waiting for a table to be cleaned.</li><li>But if you come during off times, you can usually get a table pretty fast.</li><li>They just did not want me to occupy a table where they can serve 4 people instead because the rush was starting to poor in.</li><li>It 's just disappointing. one of the best st louis wings places. go on tuesdays, get a beer, wings are half price !!! i like cajun, hot, and original buffalo. first floor gets packed quick, so go upstairs, the music is better and you can actually get a table pretty quick. love it!</li><li>If youre coming here on weekends or the holidays, booking a table might be a smart idea.</li><li>We got a table relatively quickly, and were able to get our orders in.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
