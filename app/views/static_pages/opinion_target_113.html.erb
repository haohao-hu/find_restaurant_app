<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 113' %><h2>seating<br />occurrence: 59</h2><div><ol><li>The seating is where it gets better.</li><li>The seating space is pretty good, easy to fit a small group of people.</li><li>Lovely decor, comfortable seating, great for groups ( remember to make a reservation if you 're going at lunch time, this place gets busy)!</li><li>It seemed to try hard to decorate itself, but the seating could have been better, and a lot of it was strange that they use chandelier moldings on one wall.</li><li>Seating is very limited.</li><li>Seating was sort of cramped, so I 'd probably either get takeout or dine with just 1 or 2 people.- My relatives and I took up almost the entire restaurant.</li><li>The seating is pretty nice.</li><li>This place is quite nice from inside and comfortable seating.</li><li>The restaurant is big and clean and they got very comfortable seating.</li><li>Seating is limited and the restaurant is often busy especially in the afternoon and evening.</li><li>Surprisingly enough, seating was very quick and so is service.</li><li>I heard they have nicer tables up front, but our table, while private, was quite cramped for three people, and our table and our booth seats were n't parallel and we could n't move either of them, so it made for an awkward seating experience.</li><li>I love this place the environment is amazing the seating is great.</li><li>Seating is quite ample and there is an outdoor patio.</li><li>The seating was kind of tight but I suppose this was a good sign.</li><li>Seating was a bit cramped, had a cafeteria vibe and we felt like our neighbors were staring either at us ( who stuck out a bit from the Filipino crowd) or our food.</li><li>Decor: Minimal decor, washrooms are clean and ample seating.</li><li>They have limited seating and sometimes it tends to get loud, I think it would help if they expanded this location.</li><li>The seating plan does n't feel too scattered, and the ambiance .. well, let 's just say for a Japanese restaurant, there is ambiance.</li><li>Seating is great if you get a booth, and there are plenty of them so one star for that!</li><li>We first started to dine in but the seating is not that comfortable being a small greasy spoon.</li><li>The seating inside is plentiful, the atmosphere is nice, and our waiter was just lovely ( he was very friendly and his service stood out), but as I consider food to be the star of the show, I wo n't be hurrying back here any time soon, though I wo n't say I 'd never try it again.</li><li>Loved:- The Meat Lover 's Pizza- The Seafood Linguine- The affordable wine list- The friendly, attentive and efficient service- Ample seating, very family friendly.</li><li>Service gets everything done but is slow because all seating is a small booth so it is hard to see wait staph.</li><li>Limited seating is available for dine in patrons.</li><li>Seating was tight and the food was kind of `` Chinese-y'' if that makes any sense.</li><li>Seating is a bit tight and probably can get kind of suffocating ... but there are lots of nooks and crannies for individual table seating.</li><li>Some of the seating also makes you feel like you 're trapped in a prison cell with the way the furniture is shaped.</li><li>The restaurant is decorated very nicely and has comfortable seating.</li><li>Seating in comfortable.</li><li>First of all, the seating is extremely cramped.</li><li>Seating was very, very limited so I suggest taking out!</li><li>The seating is limited but most people get it to go.</li><li>The spider roll is a giant thing, filled with tasty crunchy soft-shell crab:) Seating is a little limited, but not as limited as the parking in the roundabout.</li><li>My brother introduced me to this place about 5 years ago and we do n't go there enough only because the seating is small.</li><li>One word of suggestion however, there is very limited seating ( the place is the equivalent to the size of a study room) and there is only three or four tables to sit at so it is best to order take-out and eat elsewhere.</li><li>If you 're going there 's limited seating so prepare to wait a bit.</li><li>Seating is no problem compared to Scarborough location where it 's a mad house.</li><li>A few window/tall chairs, and a few tables--normal seating but the location seems smaller than others.</li><li>Do n't judge when you see the GIANT gold Buddah that is chipped and destroyed or the retro seating!</li><li>Seating is super limited so it 's really hard to get a table if there 's a group of u.</li><li>Staff were friendly and helpful, seating us as efficiently as they could given that the place was nearly full.</li><li>Crowded seating is not ideal for dessert house or any intimate conversation.</li><li>The only downfall is the lack of seating because the place is small.</li><li>I believe they do have a limit to 2 hour seating on weekends.</li><li>Seating is a bit tight which does n't bother me, but seemed to bother the people beside us ( we overheard them).</li><li>Other issues: their seating is painfully slow.</li><li>It 's because their seating is stupid.</li><li>Dark wood booths, comfortable seating and very clean.</li><li>Seating was scarce at lunch but service was cray fast.</li><li>The seating is very clustered so there is very little space to move through when getting to your table and leaving.</li><li>The seating is tight unless you get a separate table.</li><li>The good:- Nice decor, cool seating where you likely have to sit with other parties around the cooking station.</li><li>I have been going to this location for a few years mostly because I enjoy the pseudo-European garden atmosphere, the unique seating and the crepes.</li><li>I love the breakfast foods here:) Very spacious and they have comfortable seating.</li><li>Seating was cramped.</li><li>Seating was very comfortable.</li><li>I probably wo n't be back; something 's fishy here that does n't blend with my tastes ... i 'm not sure exactly what it is about this place that 's kept me coming back. i think it 's probably the ... ridiculously amazing subs they make! i 've been coming here for about 10 years now, and i think it 's possible that the submarines have gotten better since. seating is a bit limited, but as long as you do n't go during the rush hours, you should be fine. be prepared to wait 10 mins if it 's after last call and you 've got a craving. their bacon is just the right crispiness, their meats are fresh, fleshly diced lettuce, freshly sliced tomatoes and onions, homemade sub sauce, soft bread. mmmmmm i love that the walls are decorated with photos of loyal customers, some dating back to times when fashion meant a mullet: S they even have a pic with the stanley cup! this local spot has a following for a reason. if you love submarine sandwiches, you have to try one at belly busters. must gets are: anything with bacon `` lettuce, tomatoes, onions guys ?''.</li><li>Points off ( well, I 'm not actually taking points off, but downsides):- Limited seating- Sometimes the wait can be a bit long.</li></ol></div><ul
