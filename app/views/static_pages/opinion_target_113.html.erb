The lunch offerings are typically Korean ( bibimbap, various jjigae, and some bulgogee sets) and the prices are right.</li><li>While my fellow diners, all go for the Bibimbap, I prefer either the Pork Bone Soup or the Yuk Gae Jjang for my lunch.</li><li>We were going to order a bibimbap, but when we placed the order, the server came back to us immediately and apologized that they were out of cooked rice for which to make our bibimbap.</li><li>The two of us ordered the same dish, dol soht bibimbap, except my friend had beef and I asked for no beef on mine.</li><li>I do n't like how they use ground beef on the bibimbap .. it 's just not right.</li><li>Our favourites are the ddeokbokki, steamed mandu ( SO GOOD), grilled mackerel, bibimbap, mul/bibim-naengmyeon, and honestly most soups.</li><li>As far as the food went, I ordered the bibimbap, which came sizzling hot.</li><li>Their bibimbap was really good though and my brother seemed to enjoy his pork bulgogi hot pot with rice!</li><li>( $ 12) Their bibimbap and jampong is pretty good what you expect it to be.</li><li>You can also get bulgogi and bibimbap but the really good stuff is the tofu soup.</li><li>If you love soup, there are a few to choose from, and if soup 's not your thing, the broiled bbq is an option along with the bibimbap.</li><li>There are basically only 3 menu options- bibimbap, bulgogi and soon tofu ( 5 versions of soon tofu but still basically the same dish).</li><li>The bibimbap was good.</li><li>The food itself came out pretty quickly and the bibimbap was definitely tasty but I would n't call it the best in Toronto, not by a long shot.</li><li>The soups and bibimbap are amazing.</li><li>Options are limited to a few dishes but bibimbap will always stand out for me.</li><li>The bibimbap comes out in a sizzling stone bowl with a variety of sauteed vegetables on top of sticky rice.</li><li>The bibimbap is great too .. all with fresh veggies.</li><li>The bibimbap is really good, although I wish they would add more beef to it.</li><li>The bibimbap comes with gochujang ( otherwise you have to pay 50 cents extra for it), and it 's the really thick kind that you have to smear onto your rice, rather that squeeze from a bottle.</li><li>At $ 13 ( tax incl) though, the bibimbap is a little pricey.</li><li>My coworker and I spent the entire afternoon chugging down water to try and balance the amount of salt in the soup and kimchi We got 2x combination 1 ( $ 8.85), which had exactly 1 shrimp ( mini one) and 1 mussel, and maybe 2 bites of beef The bibimbap ( $ 11.51) had no beef ( we had to send t back to the kitchen) Awful experience, good service though I came here after trying the downtown location.</li><li>The place has the usual soon tofu, bibimbap and a soup/grilled bulgolgi.</li><li>Their bibimbap is also very good.</li><li>I never knew how bad bibimbap could be until you tasted slimy vegetables from the cucumber.</li><li>Traditionally bibimbap is also supposed to be served in a stone bowl which I love, they served it in a typical plastic noodle bowl. =/* Over view* I will never be visiting this place and to their other locations ( I believe I ate once at at FMP- First Markham Place, and never will again).</li><li>If I 'm ever craving a good bibimbap, I 'll take TTC to eat either at Kimichi House ( at Dundas Station) or multiple places at Christie Station.</li><li>Their bibimbap in a stone bowl is also very tasty when you add the extra hot sauce.</li><li>Almost all of their dishes are better than those in other Korean restaurants around the area. pork bone soup, tofu soondubu soup, beef sullungtang soup, and bibimbap are all soooo good.</li><li>They have excellent bibimbap and some special spicy squid dish.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
