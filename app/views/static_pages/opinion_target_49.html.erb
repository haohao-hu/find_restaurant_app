<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 49' %><h2>tofu<br />occurrence: 141</h2><div><ol><li>Traditionally, Korean dumplings are filled with mixtures of tofu, shredded cabbage, bean sprouts, pork, shredded kimchi and so on ... so their fillings are less firm than Chinese dumpling fillings.</li><li>My friend and I ordered- steamed xo sauce pork neck rice: a little bland, and came with a bowl of cooked lettuce in soy sauce ...- stinky hot pot: really good, with intestines, pigs blood, enokie mushrooms, fish balls, and fish cake- mixed vegetables and tofu dry pot: it was okay- herbal essence jelly in coconut milk: awesome- mango freeze: she said it was awesome The decor is nice, the service is unfriendly.</li><li>The toppings were also plentiful and excellently prepared- tasty tofu, chicken, shrimp, onion, pepper and peanut.</li><li>We ordered mushroom egg foo young, spring rolls, spicy eggplant in black bean sauce sauce with tofu, mixed vegetables, vegetable lo mein, vegetable fried rice, and mushroom egg drop soup.</li><li>The miso soup was delicious ( except for the tofu but that 's because I strongly dislike tofu).</li><li>- Friend said she was n't a big fan of the tofu and tried better ones somewhere else- Tempura seemed to be lacking in batter.</li><li>We had agedashi tofu ( crispy tofu in teriyaki sauce), electric banana ( which was weird at first but actually quite tasty), beautiful roll ( scallop, avocado, smoked salmon), yam tempura.</li><li>For $ 9.95 I got the Tofu Bento Box.</li><li>The tofu in there tasted rotten, had a weird bitter taste.</li><li>Salad dressing was refreshing and miso soup had tofu and seaweed in it.</li><li>The panchan was not as good as I remember but the yeolmu kimchi, baechu kimchi and the tofu were very, very well prepared.</li><li>Avoid the chilled tofu, curry pork skewers ( 100% fat), and green salad.</li><li>The soon tofu was average but overall I 'm disappointed.</li><li>Seaweed salad and deep-fried tofu accompanied overcooked tuna teriyaki and boring California rolls come in dinner bentos.</li><li>It came with a miso soup, edamame, and the bento box ( rice, salad, chicken, tofu, japchae). everything was average; the sauce on the chicken teriyaki was overpowering.</li><li>Our server brought green tea without us having to ask, and right after we ordered, brought complimentary appetizers -- cold tofu in a spicy vinegar-y sauce and cold edamame ( like Lesley C., I also prefer edamame served hot and salted.</li><li>We got fish &amp; tofu, chicken and broccoli, and rice.</li><li>Aside from the bony fish meats, there were a good bunch of small clams and tofu.</li><li>Now onto the food: Pad thai: rice noodles, carrots, peanuts, tofu, green onions, bean sprouts, coriander, egg, fish, and tamarind sauce with chicken.</li><li>The tofu was super greasy, not puffy, and oil oozed out of it when biting it in half.</li><li>Good tofu and bbq roast pork.</li><li>We tried the 1) tofu + mushroom, 2) tofu + corn, 3) rock crab, pumpkin, and fake sharkfin.</li><li>We tried the 1) tofu + mushroom, 2) tofu + corn, 3) rock crab, pumpkin, and fake sharkfin.</li><li>The tofu was very very fresh and silky.</li><li>Tofu and mushroom had more of a savory taste, tofu and corn was sweeter, and the pumpkin, rock crab, and fake sharkfin was a mix of both.</li><li>I personally enjoyed the tofu and corn the best, though I could n't stop eating others too!</li><li>The tofu was good though.</li><li>We also had soon tofu, pork bone soup and bulgogi.</li><li>The tofu in the soup definitely expired.</li><li>I ended up eating a lot of tofu, spam, gluten and watercress.</li><li>The thin slices of meat and soft tofu were so delicious.</li><li>In the end we were given tofu dessert but the tofu was not very fresh.</li><li>Then, we had an assortment of dishes including fried pork cutlets, fried green beans, tofu, beef and onion, Chicken with sprinkled garlic and for me, vegetarian dumplings ( but no meat).</li><li>I have tried the soon tofu, dolsot bibimbap, rice cakes and some other dishes as well but none were very impressive.</li><li>We had the kalbi + soon tofu, and the seafood + soju.</li><li>Ordered two of the lunch specials ( available from 12-4pm) soon tofu is always good here, and the Korean fried rice with chicken is really good too with the chicken chunks really tender.</li><li>The best soon tofu ever!</li><li>The tofu is so smooth and soft!</li><li>I also had bibimbab, it 's average, the outstanding soon tofu makes everything seems just fine.</li><li>Soontofu or Soondubu is probably my favourite Korean dish so far because it usually comes spicy, it has both meat ( should you choose), egg ( s), and veggies ( tofu, cabbage and stuff)!</li><li>The tofu is really good here of course, it 's silky smooth and drool worthy.</li><li>I came at lunchtime for my usual favorite: kimchi soon tofu.</li><li>The kimchi soon tofu they served me today has half-fermented kimchi, with some other leafy vegetable that is n't bok choy ...</li><li>The tofu they use is the softest tofu I have ever had, my favorite type of tofu.</li><li>The tofu they use is the softest tofu I have ever had, my favorite type of tofu.</li><li>The tofu was silky, as it should be, and the broth was flavourful.</li><li>As a huge tofu fan, I love soon tofu!</li><li>The texture of the tofu is to die for, and the soup is generally bursting with flavour.</li><li>The broth was great and the tofu was just enough this time ( use to be overflowing).</li><li>The usual dishes we often order are: seafood soon tofu, kimchi soon tofu, bbp, soybean soon tofu and bulgogi.</li><li>The usual dishes we often order are: seafood soon tofu, kimchi soon tofu, bbp, soybean soon tofu and bulgogi.</li><li>The usual dishes we often order are: seafood soon tofu, kimchi soon tofu, bbp, soybean soon tofu and bulgogi.</li><li>My favourite is probably kimchi soon tofu ( I love kimchi ..).</li><li>By far this is the best place ever hands down to go for soon tofu and once you have it here you cannot go anywhere else!</li><li>I ask for it with less tofu.</li><li>I love the soup, and this gives me more to slurp as the tofu certainly expands a ton.</li><li>Flavorful soup, silky tofu, seafood, perfectly cooked rice, freshly cracked eggs half cooked in the soup, plus the water soaking the flavor of burned rice bottom on the stone bowl, it 's a perfect combination of flavors and texture.</li><li>I had the kimchi soon tofu which comes with a side bowl of rice.</li><li>I rarely give out five stars but you ca n't go wrong with the bubbling pots filled with soft, melt-in-your-mouth tofu, made to your order of spiciness, especially when winter comes.</li><li>The tofu in the soup was unbelievable, velvety texture and mild flavour soaked up the broth very well.</li><li>I also had a bit of my friend 's seafood soon tofu which was also delicious, served with shrimp ( head on) and mussels ( they were out of oysters on this night).</li><li>Great tofu, soup was a bit on the salty side but the rice helped with that.</li><li>= P We order a simple soybean soon tofu ( white) and a combination ( extra spicy).</li><li>It 's a tough verdict as I believe the soybean soon tofu would have been a good choice, but the girlfriend ca n't handle anything really spicy.</li><li>As we ate, I added some of the side dishes into the rice with the soon tofu.</li><li>I tend to go for the seafood soon tofu.</li><li>The broth for the soon tofu was very flavourful and the purple rice is delicious!</li><li>There are basically only 3 menu options- bibimbap, bulgogi and soon tofu ( 5 versions of soon tofu but still basically the same dish).</li><li>Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu is always packed so prepare to wait.</li><li>Onto the food:- the meat and brisket they serve with the soup is delicious, however I found the broth a bit bland- purple rice is very very good. i had the seafood soon tofu.</li><li>Even so I had a hard time deciding between their sizzling bibimbap and piping hot soon tofu!</li><li>I went with their medium spicy veggie soon tofu- a bit of a kick but I would say I can take on their extra spicy with no problem.</li><li>Got the dumpling soon tofu mild today but it seemed like they forgot the salt!</li><li>I always have the Kimchi soon tofu.</li><li>One of the best tofu hot pot spots in Toronto.</li><li>I ll go back again for tofu soup everything on the menu ( 9 things) is divineness. service is quick, but that 's asian food for ya!</li><li>The side dishes were average, I still prefer Joons or Oh Geul Boh Geuls side dishes but moving on, the menu was fairly simple it had variations of soon tofu, bulgogi and bibimbap.</li><li>Their tofu is so silky smooth and I love that they serve purple rice, which is a more healthier alternative!</li><li>I only deducted 0.5 because the soup is sometimes on the salty side and the eggs they give you are extra tiny! `` everyone knows, when you go to Buk Chang 's, it 's for the soon tofu. unless you have a serious aversion to the texture of silk, do as the locals do and order one of the gloriously smooth tofu soups. they are THE BEST in the city! although, soon tofu is sometimes referred to as stew, it 's more like a light, flavourful broth with pieces of vegetables, tofu, and sometimes meat. it 's served piping hot, and in my opinion, best eaten in the colder months. hints: parking is in the back alley nearby subway is finch station, head south 2 blocks see jimi 's review of the toronto location at: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/buk-chang-dong-soon-tofu-toronto I did n't expect that much from Korean food.</li><li>I go here at least once a week, and always get the same thing- vegetable soon tofu ( and I ask for extra broccoli).</li><li>Pretty good, stick with the tofu, the bbq beef was a big dry.</li><li>Also, For those who do n't like spicy soup, this places soon tofu will taste great even with 0 spicyness ( it wont be bland, which is what I 've found in some other soon tofu restaurants).</li><li>Had the dumpling soon tofu and my hubby had the seafood one.</li><li>I 'm not a big fan of soon tofu, I 'd rather have PBS.</li><li>There are only a few menu 's here, beef, mixed, seafood, bean paste ' soon tofu', comes with stone bowl rice and ' noo roong ji' afterwards. bi bim bap, bul gogi and some others which most of them are pretty good.</li><li>Overall, tofu is good, side dishes are poor and not sure if it 's hygienic, service is very poor, I 'm disappointed.</li><li>Soon tofu, soon tofu, and more soon tofu.</li><li>I usually get number #4 which is soon tofu with beef and dumplings with mild spice.</li><li>My partner had the beef dumpling soon tofu which was the only item he could have since he has to avoid any type of shellfish, pork or mushrooms ... probably wo n't be returning because of this ...</li><li>I guess tofu soup just does n't sound that appealing to me.</li><li>Many years ago one of my korean friend took me there, and I have since developed constant cravings for soon tofu ( and get frustrated when I ca n't have access to good ones).</li><li>The dumpling soon tofu soup was ok except it had a grand total of 2 dumplings and the rest was pretty much a mixture of tofu and broth.</li><li>My go-to dishes are the kimchi soon tofu and the bulgogi.</li><li>Number 4 dumpling soon tofu is my all-time favorite.</li><li>The best soon tofu in town! #nomnom Visited this branch of the soon tofu FRANCHISE of Toronto.</li><li>The broth is excellent, and the tofu is clean and tender.</li><li>But I do n't think I will ever come back here .... maybe to try the kim chi soon tofu but someone else is gonna have to pay cuz i cannot justify this spending!</li><li>I usually order the bulgogi soup and my friend has ordered the tofu spicy soup several times.</li><li>Thirdly, i got the seafood soon tofu, and there were two dried out shrimp too hard to get off the shell, one mussel and a couple of small shrunken oysters.</li><li>I 've had much seafood soon tofu soup at innumerable Korean restaurants but none stands out quite like this one; their broth is very aromatic with the kick of heat.</li><li>The place speciality is their tofu based Korean dish their other dishes are also a must try, the place is over all welcoming and will unquestionably give you taste of Korea while making Koreans nostalgic for a meal from home.</li><li>- Good Order:- Bulgogi soup + Hot Stone Pot Rice- Seafood Soon Tofu + Hot Stone Rice Not my first choice of restaurant when I 'm craving for soon tofu.</li><li>This is the best place in Toronto for soon tofu.</li><li>The tofu is so soft and silky and the soup is delicious -- not too sour, which is the problem I find with some other restaurants, and a little bit thicker consistency in my opinion.</li><li>I love the choices they provide with my usual being the dumpling soon tofu.</li><li>The seafood soon tofu is a must try.</li><li>The tofu is silky and is complimented by different meats, seafood and veggies.</li><li>You can choose how spicy you want your soon tofu and the side dishes are very tasty.</li><li>The tofu is silky soft in a rich flavourful soup, the kimchee has a satisfying kick, and ouuu I love the marinated bean sprouts!</li><li>Maybe it 's because it 's my second time eating here but I feel like the tofu I had at Bloor tasted a little bit better than here.</li><li>Best tofu in Toronto hands down and the prices are very reasonable.</li><li>I again ordered kimchi soon tofu and got a big bowl of purple rice ( which is apparently very healthy for you), soon tofu in a clay pot and a quail egg.</li><li>All of our tofu pots were tasty in their different ways ( the vegetable tofu soup tasted like spicy vegetable broth, the soup for the combination tofu tasted like spicy seafood, and the kimchi soon tofu tasted well like kimchi).</li><li>All of our tofu pots were tasty in their different ways ( the vegetable tofu soup tasted like spicy vegetable broth, the soup for the combination tofu tasted like spicy seafood, and the kimchi soon tofu tasted well like kimchi).</li><li>The tofu is super silky and delicious.</li><li>The tofu is very silky and the soup has a nice kick to it if you order anything above mild spiciness.</li><li>Spicy and satisfying are the perfect words to describe soon tofu.</li><li>This place 's purple rice and super silky smooth tofu is delicious and fantastic.</li><li>As my last review pointed out, soon tofu is not my favorite thing.</li><li>The place has the usual soon tofu, bibimbap and a soup/grilled bulgolgi.</li><li>In any case, their soon tofu is presented the same way as BCD in LA with the rice served in a dol sot and then the dol sot with the leftover rice is filled with hot water to make a porridge.</li><li>The soon tofu is silky smooth and the soup has just the right amount of heat in it.</li><li>The `` regular'' soon tofu is already pretty spicy, so if you ca n't handle the heat, go with the mild.</li><li>My friend ordered the seafood soon tofu ( extra spicy) while I had the kimchi soon tofu ( regular spicy).</li><li>My friend ordered the seafood soon tofu ( extra spicy) while I had the kimchi soon tofu ( regular spicy).</li><li>The portions are pretty generous with seemingly endless tofu.</li><li>Food ( Lunch): Besides the cooking table I have been for lunch service and ate the chicken-bento-box with soup, small salad, 4 sushi rolls, rice and tofu.</li><li>Otherwise, full of tasty and well-prepared ingredients ( the tofu was brilliant) and worth it.</li><li>The tofu was great, though.</li><li>Speaking of which, the miso soup was nice, I do n't care for tofu and so it was nice it did n't have much.</li><li>In the bento box the fish is ok and the tofu was meh, but nothing outstanding overall.</li><li>Usually order the Chicken Pad Thai ( noodles, tofu, chicken, a sprinkling of green onions and a pack of ground peanuts on the side), Spring Rolls ( 2, with sauce) and/or the Ginger Chicken ( stuffed with chicken and different mushrooms, a few red peppers and a flavorful sauce).</li><li>The tofu seemed over cooked and the pad thai was starchy.</li><li>The Side dishes they offer are not bad either, I liked the tofu and potatoes they give.</li><li>The soup had tofu and some beef and veggies in it.</li><li>They have a great selection of vegetables, meat, tofu and condiments.</li><li>Meat-eaters have said the grill is great; the tofu, however, has been frozen and is tasteless and spongy.</li><li>We decided to order the supreme super bowl congee, cantonese chow mein, three kinds stuffed vegetables ( eggplant, tofu and green pepper), minced pork and dried fish green beans and fried chili turnip patties.</li><li>My bf, however, seem to love the food here ( particularly the Tofu and Garoupa which he gets every single time =. =)</li><li>However, I do appreciate that their food is not too oily or salty!- other pros: LARGE portions, large variety of congee and noodles, friendly staff- con: can become very crowded: ( side dishes I 've tried and liked: tofu and garoupa, house special chicken, mushroom and beef, tofu and mixed veggie congees I 've tried and liked: mixed vegetable and sweetcorn, sweetcorn and beancurd. congees I 've tried and disliked: sliced fish congee tastes bland ....</li><li>However, I do appreciate that their food is not too oily or salty!- other pros: LARGE portions, large variety of congee
