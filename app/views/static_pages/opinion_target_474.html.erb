<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 474' %><h2>Pulled Pork<br />occurrence: 10</h2><div><ol><li>The Pulled Pork resembled a disassembled hawser ... and stringy as the last pair of a Huskie 's halter.</li><li>It 's assembly-line style ordering: type of tortitlla, type of meat ( I 've had pulled pork), toppings like veggies, cheese, guac ( EXTRA $ $), sour cream, and type of salsa ( warning: the hot IS hot).</li><li>I would recommend the pulled steak ( second would be the pulled pork followed by chicken and shrimp- both chicken and shrimp are a little bland from my experience- I have yet to try the fish).</li><li>I had the pulled pork and was happy with it.</li><li>Beer makes me happy. this was ok --- SUMMARY --- Plus 's: good place to hang out, decent food, Minus 's: sitting on the patio means breathing all the car exhaust from the cars on Yonge street --- MORE DETAILS --- we choose a platter for two ... it consisted of: very tender chicken ( i picked it up and a piece of meat fell off- SO TENDER) first time i had cornbread- it looked burnt on the bottom, so i just ate the top part not bad ( it would n't ' be my first choice) pulled pork was ok chicken wings were fairly good beef brisket was pretty good .. ribs were kinda dry ... in the end everything kinda tasted the same. fries were good- not too salty. stepping in, the restaurant itself is nice, there are booths or table seating indoors. the main window is a garage front that opens into the patio area facing yonge st. interior has exposed beam ceilings and there 's many nostalgic memorabilia decorated throughout. we ordered a couple of things from the menu 1. spaghetti with beef brisket- yeah i know an experimental dish but i was feeling like spaghetti and if the brisket was good -- you know that would been amazing. unfortunately the brisket was covered in tomato sauce so I could n't taste it in it 's full glory or not ..</li><li>Pulled pork was also cold saugy and fatty.</li><li>Boiled tips were just gross, the brisket was a dry tasteless piece of leather, the chicken was from a steamer type cooker the skin was soft and rubbery, the pulled pork was hands down the worst pulled pork I have ever had!</li><li>Boiled tips were just gross, the brisket was a dry tasteless piece of leather, the chicken was from a steamer type cooker the skin was soft and rubbery, the pulled pork was hands down the worst pulled pork I have ever had!</li><li>The pulled pork was NOT smoked.</li><li>The pulled pork was ok, but what stopped it from being great was too much bbq sauce and fried onions.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
