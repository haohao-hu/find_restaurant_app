<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 194' %><h2>cashier<br />occurrence: 32</h2><div><ol><li>Another reason why the line is barely moving is because there is only one cash register and the cashier is trying to figure out what you ordered more than half the time.</li><li>As soon as I walked in I was welcomed by an extra friendly cashier.</li><li>I have to say that the cashier was pretty rude.</li><li>1 as a combo and the cashier made a mistake of punching in as 3 combos.</li><li>My husband did n't even have a yelp account but the cashier was so patient and told us we could have two transactions to get both cocktails for free:).</li><li>Very limited parking in this dingy plaza ... upon entering this place we were not greeted by anyone at all, the cashier did n't even bother saying a single word, Infact the entire time at this place the only word that was spoken to us by the cashier and waitress combined is $ 15.50 ..... there goes their tip and customer service, we decided to just seat ourselves where a table had menus on it, the waitress did n't give us tea and ordering slip til 10mins later .... typically pho place that 's very cheap like $ 7 a dish depending on what you order The whole entire time I did n't hear a single word from the waitress and she looked so pissed off, did n't break a smile but oh well Mediocre food, nothing special and honestly I 've tasted better bun and com dishes elsewhere.</li><li>The cashier did everything and I was impressed.</li><li>I was welcomed by a friendly cashier and ordered 2 Piece Combo ( $ 7.89 per 2 Piece Chicken, Choice of Salad, Choice of Tater or Fries, CAN of Pop).</li><li>The cashier was really friendly when I went there.</li><li>It 's ready in a couple of minutes and the cashier is always nice!</li><li>The most recent time I went, the cashier took one order at a time and waited until it was packed in the bag before taking the next order.</li><li>The cashier lady who handles all takeout orders is incredibly friendly.</li><li>HOWEVER, as some other reviews have mentioned the male who works the cashier is moody at times.</li><li>The cashier was impatient taking my order, and kept telling me `` Your total is ...'' when I 'm not even finished ordering.</li><li>The cashier named, `` ZOE or JOY'' were super rude ..</li><li>I came back wanting them to remake it, and the cashier took another straw, poked a hole, and took a sip from the drink I already drank ... gross. any who, I do n't recommend that item on the menu. either that location does n't know how to make it right, or it just tastes nasty. it looks quite appetizing though.</li><li>My favorite drinks are: Grass jelly roasted milk tea Jasmine green milk tea Honey green tea Red bean green tea smoothie ( brain freeze will occur) Mango green tea Chrysanthemum tea There service is a hit or miss. The cashier may or may not be friendly.</li><li>The cashier was rather rude and impatient at me.</li><li>The cashier is efficient.</li><li>The cashier checked our takeout order before handing it over and found that the kitchen had made an error, so she had them fix it.</li><li>At the end of our meal, we went to pay the bill and was mischarged 3 times- the cashier kept cancelling and re-entering the order, charging for a large size orange juice ( $ 4.99) rather than a small ( $ 2.99).</li><li>The cashier is very busy.</li><li>The cashier is real nice and always gives a smile.</li><li>The worst offense was watching the cashier cut cucumbers and then handle the cash screen, money, people 's cards, and then go back to cutting cucumbers WITHOUT WASHING HER HANDS!</li><li>Or else, like a well-practiced act, you might get a scowl face from the female japanese cashier who then, out of frustration, subsequently hands you a debit machine in a covert fashion ( I witnessed this many times).</li><li>The cashier was patient when I was making my decision.</li><li>Not to mention the cashier who had an attitude when I asked for a side of spicy mayo and charged 1.50 for it!</li><li>The cashier then decided to make a scene and start throwing things around the kitchen.</li><li>The cashier forgot to give it to them.</li><li>The cashier took our order and punched it in, herself.</li><li>We got seated at a gloomy corner behind one of the cashier booth, we can literally touch their screen and keyboard, THEY SHOULD REALLY GET RID of this table!</li><li>First thing I noticed is that the order at the cashier was a bit chaotic.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
