<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 32' %><h2>beef<br />occurrence: 243</h2><div><ol><li>They have the best Turkish kefta mix to flavour ground beef, or better yet a mixture of beef and lamb.</li><li>I told the waitress `` NO ONIONS, NO EGGS, NO CHICKEN, NO BEEF, NO SEAFOOD, and NO GREEN PEPPERS ( the green peppers was a choice).''</li><li>Overall 2/5 portion was good, price, and taste of the rice was lovely, the beef was a bit bland, and presentation was satisfactory.</li><li>Like most sushi restaurants they have lunch deals -- which are bento boxes of your typical beef, chicken or salmon teriyaki meat, rice, salad, soup &amp; fried tempera.</li><li>We tried the falafel appetizer, kabob ( mixture of beef and lamb), chicken tabaka ( also known as butterfly chicken), and the salmon dish.</li><li>The color was kind of off- all sashimi had a warm taste and it was covered in water- it just did n't taste pleasant, we ordered a second round of sashimi .. same thing Rolls- Our roll order was forgotten on the FIRST ticket .. mmm .. we ordered their signature roll .. it was really meh .... and the nori was chewy handroll- the Nori was very soft when it came ... portion of rice to filling .. rice more .. filling a bit .. no good Hot Food- beef roll enoki, and green onions, short ribs, grilled shrimp, grilled cutlet, grilled mushroom, grilled beef, grilled chicken heart, etc etc ( The shrimp did not taste fresh again) but overall the beef were all pretty good! ( or 2nd order some of the grill items were once again forgotten !!!! they were n't even full for the evening !!)</li><li>The food I liked today includes the short ribs, sakura rose sushi, skillets, chicken kagame, calamari, takoyaki, beef and mushroom wrap.</li><li>The beef was so tender and delicious.</li><li>The beef teriyaki uses good beef unlike other restaurants I 've been to.</li><li>He ordered the beef and yam sushi which he always gets and loves.</li><li>The menu does n't have an extensive selection of meals as other Viet restaurants but they do have the basics of spring rolls, pho ( beef and chicken), pho beef stew, rice and noodles.</li><li>The beef are fresh and just perfectly done every single time ( never over cook.</li><li>The batter was soggy and was more like a thick fish n ' chip type batter, the beef tasted like 2 day old roast beef and it was cut very thick.</li><li>Had lots of pork, beef, shrimp and vegetables.</li><li>In terms of what we ordered: Mussels- excellent Chicken souvlaki- great Prime rib- no good, dont order this Garlic bread- excellent Steak and shrimp fajitas- steak not so good, shrimp was excellent Seems like they are n't too good with their beef, but everything else was great.</li><li>Being vegan, I have to exclude the beef and egg from my bibimbap, so the variety, freshness, and flavour of the veggies is what I look for.</li><li>I got the beef and mushroom bibimbap.</li><li>In fact if I did n't know it had beef, I would not be able to tell.</li><li>Not AS crispy as the beef, bit less sweet.</li><li>None of us went for the seemingly notorious ginger chicken, but from what I can recall, the sweet and sour chicken balls, the fried dumplings, the chicken thing my gal ordered, and the crispy beef were all delicious, served fast, and priced right.</li><li>I focused on the non-fried beef and chicken dishes with the sauces on the rice from some of the other dishes.</li><li>For the beef of course, but also to revisit the other chicken and shrimp dishes I sampled.</li><li>The two standout dishes of the night were crispy ginger chicken and crispy beef.</li><li>The beef came in thinner strips and was caramelized to the point of delightful, near-jerky chewiness.</li><li>Quick eat Crispy ginger beef came burnt as shit and they did n't slice up the beef.</li><li>Ordered the House fried rice with beef and broccoli.</li><li>The beef was tender and the broccoli was also soft ( which was weired texture wise but was ok by me.).</li><li>Highlights for me were the crispy chicken, crispy beef, chili chicken, and sizzling shrimp with scallions and ginger.</li><li>The service and quality of food is extremely disappointing as chicken was their only option since they burned their beef.</li><li>Curry Goat Roti: $ 7.95 Beef Roti: $ 6.95 Eggplant Roti: $ 5.95 ( prices as of Aug 2014, before tax. cash or debit only) Both times we got Peanut Punch to drink ( $ 1.50), which is a fun Jamaican treat.</li><li>Had the Beef Chow Fun and once I ordered it the cashier barked out the order in cantonese to old school short order cooks in their greased up whites, I knew this place could be for real.</li><li>Therefore, my rating is based on the overcooked noodles and beef that is n't raw when served.</li><li>We go there or Pho more particularly Beef tendon, lean beef, and tripe and for Tom Yun soup for my wife.</li><li>Rare beef was not rare, and the beef balls were cold, so I had to submerge it in the soup and save it for later to eat.</li><li>Though overcooked rare beef is common at chinese pho restaurants, I have NEVER had a cold beef ball before, this was the first.</li><li>I love the Duck with Konjac and the cold beef and tripe with five spice.</li><li>Saw a guest ordered a dish in the hidden menu, called beef in sour soup.</li><li>The BEEF was very tender in my opinion and the Cilantro/Scallions gave a bit of fresh flavour to the saltiness.</li><li>The beef covered in hot oil and spices in a bowl used to be better but something has changed about it.</li><li>A few of my favourites off the top of my head ...- avocado milkshake- pho with beef balls and rare beef- chicken pho- banh cuon- spring rolls ( or egg rolls, whatever you want to call it)- com tam This place is small for the amount of customers dining and waiting to get into the restaurant.</li><li>The portion was very good for its price, I am surprised at the amount of beef they put in.</li><li>My parents had #42 Pho Dac Biet ( Special Pho, which contained rare beef, well done beef flank, brisket, soft tendons, tripe and meat balls).</li><li>Lots of tender slices of beef.</li><li>I had my usual pho with rare beef.</li><li>I ordered their pho with well done beef and beef tendons.</li><li>The broth was flavourful, and had a good amount of beef and tendons.</li><li>When I got home I realized that they literally gave me frozen beef.</li><li>That 's rare beef, tripe, tendons, beef balls plus the noodles and broth for $ 6.50.</li><li>The server had told us in advance that the beef is served medium rare, which was fine, because we usually order meat rare to medium rare.</li><li>The beef was average in taste and extremely fatty.</li><li>A whole section of the menu is devoted to burgers, beef and otherwise, all sided with serviceable slaw and regrettably frozen fries.</li><li>The beef was cooked to pefection.</li><li>Food wise, I got the beef ( medium).</li><li>Try their beef, lamb or chicken kabob, way better than Lahore in Little India.</li><li>My family and I went here for dinner last week and ordered chicken biryani, beef seekh kabobs and chicken kabobs with naan, Naan 's were very good, fresh out of the tandoor oven along with the beef and chicken kabobs.</li><li>The spicy mustard that went with the rye bread and the beef made the dish all the more salivating and I took home a pound of the corned beef following my meal ...... three homemade sandwiches later with Wolfie 's meat, I 'd still go back for more I quite liked the friendly man who served us the two times we went.</li><li>This one did, the beef was rubbery and dry as if it was microwaved then served on to a hot plate.</li><li>But must mention the following too:- Line up to pay- Onion grilled with the skin still on ( from no frills to the grills)- half chicken not fully cooked inside but burnt outside- too much tahini in the hummus- beef a bit dry Other than that the rest was good Great place to share food and chit chat.</li><li>We went with the chicken tabliyeh Saj wrap and a mixed combo platter which and assortment of items that included: beef and chicken shawarma, kofta, beef skewer and shish tawouk.</li><li>The beef was very tough- could n't stab it with a fork and had to use my hands.</li><li>Unfortunately the beef was dry.</li><li>The beef was kind of dry, which the sauce had to make up for.</li><li>- Nope!)- No Pita bread, but seemed like sausage buns that were tunred into a type of Garlic Bread ( WTF, right ?)- Lemon Potatoes seemed like they were cooked in Campbell 's Vegetable Soup and had an orange colored sauce on them ( Really, Campbell 's ?)- Meat was of a lower quality and smaller size chunks- beef was heavily spiced which is never a good sign when eating meat.</li><li>I tried my boyfriend 's steak &amp; ale pie ... tasty tender beef chunks and really good pie crust.</li><li>I had ordered the beef in the past and wanted to try something different- preferred the beef to the chicken for sure.</li><li>I also enjoyed the Korean beef with purple rice as the beef was soft and sweet.</li><li>FOOD I had my same pho with rare beef, beef intestine ( they say it more eloquently on the menu).</li><li>We get the same things every time: a large pho with rare beef, brisket and tripe, a Vermicelli salad with either grilled pork or chicken, a small plate of spring rolls.</li><li>My favourite is their Bun Cuon and pho with rare beef and beef balls.</li><li>Eat a lot of pho with my buddies and this place was the recommended spot if wiling to make the drive ( close to my fianc√©e 's house) I love the thicker noodles as compared to other places and even though my well done beef is NEVER well done I still love this place because that seems to be the norm I usually get well done beef with beef balls and always enjoy the meal despite the mountain of fat that ends up beside my bowl A place to try if you have not already* Edited to 3 stars from 4, because their unsanitary work ethics.</li><li>If I do n't plan on eating it right away, I freeze the rare beef and then just boil it later with the soup before dumping the noodles in.</li><li>I had the rare beef and brisket pho and my nephew had the rare beef and meatballs pho.</li><li>I had the rare beef and brisket pho and my nephew had the rare beef and meatballs pho.</li><li>Pho with rare beef and beef balls- Noodles was decent, but standard.</li><li>The beef short rib is usually my favourite, but this time the meat was too fatty.</li><li>Love the beef short ribs and variety of fresh, delicious hand crafted sushi that they offer here.</li><li>The noodles, tempura ( veggies only, the shrimp was meh), beef and rock shrimp were the highlights.</li><li>I ordered everything from salmon rolls, spicy seafood udon, grilled chicken and beef, seaweed salad, and a variety of other items on their packed lunch menu.</li><li>Service is quick and friendly. went for lunch before and went again for dinner, the sashimi were fresh and thick cut the way they are suppose to be and the beef and the scallop sashimi was delishhhhhh !!!</li><li>The beef in my dish was tender, garnished with a lot of onions and some brocoli and a large serving of rice.</li><li>I then moved on to asking what kind of beef and chicken dishes they had with garlic and a soy sauce base.</li><li>Being the beef lover I am I often opt for the roast beef with arugula, tomatoes and horseradish mayo on a ciabatta lunga.</li><li>The beef I had was good.</li><li>The beef was okay.</li><li>The beef was tough- pieces of steak not ground beef but the beef was chewy and not cooked through.</li><li>The beef was tough- pieces of steak not ground beef but the beef was chewy and not cooked through.</li><li>The beef was melt in your mouth tender, the sauce was a bit spicy for my taste, but he enjoyed it. ( we asked for next time, and you can request a milder sauce) We 'll definitely be coming back for more !!</li><li>Some of the beef was more chewy than the rest but overall the dish was good.</li><li>The beef was OK nothing special also sweet for some reason.</li><li>Rice Noodle with Beef and Black Bean Sauce ( $ 7.95) has the same rubbery beef, tons of noodles but not enough sauce.</li><li>I just got home and the beef is completely burnt and disgusting ( I can post a picture if anyone is interested).</li><li>The soup was awful, the beef was okay just not much flavor, The tempura shrimp were good and the Cali sushi that came with it was simple like grocery store simple in taste.</li><li>Definitely a ginger chicken, pineapple chicken curry, golden beef, some vegetables and another curry and all of it was really good.</li><li>Boyfriend had the Pho Tai Gan Sach which was made with well-done beef, beef tendon and beef tripe.</li><li>The beef was a little overtenderized and the tripe was cut too thin in my opinion.</li><li>I ordered Pho Tai Gan Sach which consists of well-done beef, beef tendon &amp; beef tripe.</li><li>The beef was overly tenderized &amp; the tripe was cut way too thin &amp; the soup base was a downer.</li><li>I love their beef and veal dishes.</li><li>It was barely warm, and the overall amount I got was n't worth the price ( and very little beef was added).</li><li>The beef was marinated very well, plentiful, and sweet.</li><li>It was dry, beef was tough and there was hardly anything in it.</li><li>After seeing many reviews, I wish we tried the crispy beef.</li><li>The beef is super tender and the curry is absolutely amazing!</li><li>Pannang Curry- I liked this dish best. very tasty! the beef was cooked well and very very tender.</li><li>The beef in the beef salad was average, although the salad itself did taste a little awkward because of the pairings of raw thai basil, cilantro and mint ( hard to pickup with a fork too).</li><li>For our meal, we had the crispy beef, shrimp pad thai, and rice with panang curry- all very good.</li><li>The beef was cooked well and could have fall apart with a fork if you really wanted it too.</li><li>The crispy batter on the beef maybe could have been thinner, but I did n't mind that too much.</li><li>My fourth coworker got the golden curry with crispy beef.</li><li>The beef fell apart it was so nice and soft.</li><li>We had the Crispy Beef Panang Curry ( which tasted like not nothing we have tried before-crispy outside and THE softest beef EVER) and the Chicken Royal Pad Thai which was a bit sweet and really good as well.</li><li>The curry itself is amazing and not too spicy and the beef is tender on the inside and has a light crispy outside. i ca n't get myself to try any of the other mains! for apps i 've tried their mango salad ( note that there 's coriander in it, which I hate and mint leaves which I also do n't like), beef satay ( not bad), and their fried calamari ( I would get this again and loved the honey chili dipping sauce it came with). desserts I 've tried their mango sticky rice ( the mango was not sweet and really hard) and their deep fried banana with honey ( just standard). the decor here is super cool and there 's a nice patio area for the summer, I love this place!</li><li>Panang curry with crispy beef.</li><li>The beef is so nicely cooked and the genius of it 's crispy texture goes so well with the complex sauce it bathes in.</li><li>Shrimp Panang is a Thai fried curry sauce made with coconut milk, sweet basil and lime leaf, usually topped off with bell peppers, peanuts and chicken, beef or shrimp.</li><li>Their saving grace is the crispy beef.</li><li>Panang curry with crispy beef- while the curry was creamy and went well with the rice, the beef was lacking any texture and again the breading was too thick.</li><li>My favourite part was the beef itself, which was tender, juicy and battered- and the light batter coating made for a nice crunch.</li><li>The rare beef was quite raw, but cooks in seconds in the hot soup.</li><li>The beef was so fat that even tasted like pork.</li><li>Rare beef and tendon pho, it was a pretty decent broth considering its a Chinese viet restaurant.</li><li>Every Lamb and Beef dish on this picture friendly menu is AWESOME. go in for a warm lamb stew or chef 's special soup in the winter, or cool garlic cucumbers in the summer. their beef or lamb chinese style pancakes are YUM -- delightfully puffy and filled with perfectly seasoned meat. their house special beef noodle soup is cravable! you can taste the time and love in the soup base. ughh so goooood .. and the hand pulled noodles are as real as they get outside of la chine. seriously ? who cooks like this anymore outside of china ? -- these are classic techniques! the decor is kind of hilarious though, a lil step up from a hole in the wall, it 's definitely clean, but it also feels like you 're in the middle of nowhere china, really really first gen. like you 've escaped the city. and nothing matches. the walls are cheerily painted like you 're walking into the plateaus deep into china, starkly contrasting the leather booths and the crazy yellow seat covers that match the trilingual waitress 's outfits ( they mainly speak mandarin, some canto, and english). the TVs are always playing old 50 's chinese black &amp; white talkies, and there are neon signs boasting great halel food! the chef is usually out and about greeting the customers- he 's won awards for his food, and i agree -- this place is seriously the best regional lamb and beef dishes that 's hit the east side of this city since ... johnny 's burgers. i highly recommend this place! because i 'd be so sad to see it go under because no one knows about it. deserves my YUM YUM approval fo sheezie;) Great food at this so-so looking restaurant.</li><li>My friend said the food is actually classified as Islamic, so all the dishes are lamb or beef.</li><li>Everything I 've tried at this restaurant was fairly good; I 've had lamb skewers, both the beef and lamb in a sliced bun, and lamb and beef ramen.</li><li>The beef was tender with sweet and garlic flavours which gave the dish a nice balance.</li><li>We especially loved the whole garlic cloves that were cooked with the beef.</li><li>We ordered bean sprouts, hand made beef noodle soup, spicy beef lung, sizzling beef and veggies as well as lamb skewers.</li><li>The menu consists of shawarmas ( Lamb, chicken, beef), falafel, kebabs ( beef or chicken) in a pita or as a platter with salad, hummus, garlic sauce and rice or fries for the meat options.</li><li>If in your plate, the beef, the rice and the salad is not good then I really do n't know what to rate this place as.</li><li>The downside was caused by an underseasoned rice side and the lack of flavours in the beef it self.</li><li>All the meats, lamb, beef, chicken are very flavourful and tender.The rice and salad are very good as well.</li><li>They have the mandatory required tripe, tendon and brisket with rare beef.</li><li>I ordered rare beef and beef balls pho.</li><li>The pho was so little, beef was quite tough and chewy, the tripe was good.</li><li>Tried the Beef curry first; the beef was tender but very dry.</li><li>I tried dipping the noodles and beef into the soup but it was still meh.</li><li>Yeung chow fried rice, spicy salt and pepper squid, beef and dough fritter rice noodle roll and general tao chicken was what we ordered.</li><li>Firstly, we had beef and chicken dishes, both `` felt'' like they had been treated with a meat tenderizer.</li><li>Cantonese chow mein, turnip patties, fried squid, house congee, general tao 's chicken, snow pea leaf, gai lan/Chinese broccoli, beef and broccoli, roast pork, BBQ duck, fish maw soup, hot and sour soup, soft-shell crab fried rice, eel fried rice ... I can go on forever.</li><li>Also, their Singaporean Vermacelli, their Yeung Chow Fried Rice, their beef Ho Phun .... well, any of their noodles and fried rice are awesome. oh, but do n't try their Thai dishes ..... it 's not their forte.</li><li>The beef is tender no texture and taste like cardboard.</li><li>Great place for late night eats, special congee is loaded with shrimp and beef balls. gota try the turnip cake Having some good fried squid and turnips.</li><li>Very very disappointed I have to say, the food was not fresh, the beef was almost a blackish color and tasted sour, when I pointed out to the waitrese and the manager, they said that 's the way it should be.</li><li>They have pork, beef, chicken, short ribs, and pork belly marinated in Korean BBQ Marinade.</li><li>The beef and short ribs were easily the best part of the meal.</li><li>I ordered the beef and seafood table stirring.</li><li>The menu items and the quality of their beef.</li><li>Sadly, the beef here is n't the best ( even for AYCE).</li><li>The beef was really good- along with the dipping sauces.</li><li>We ordered the lamb, beef, taro, udon noodles, napa cabbage, shrimp ( with shell), tofu, and some other stuff.</li><li>The soup base and noodle are good but the meat itself is too dry, especially the beef.</li><li>The beef and pork were chopped and cubed, and tasted average.</li><li>The beef is stewed so well, not tough at all.</li><li>The beef was juicy and the serving was pretty hefty.</li><li>They used pretty good cuts of beef.</li><li>I love their hand cut noodles soaked in soy braised beef soup with chunks of tender flavorful beef.</li><li>We loved the thick handmade noodles of the `` soy beef stew noodle'' and the beef was tender.</li><li>After having drank a spoonful of broth we resorted to just eating the noodles and the beef ( without drinking the broth) but because of how salty the broth was, they just tasted like salty noodles and salty beef.</li><li>After having drank a spoonful of broth we resorted to just eating the noodles and the beef ( without drinking the broth) but because of how salty the broth was, they just tasted like salty noodles and salty beef.</li><li>Lots of delish beef.</li><li>To top it off, there was so much white pepper in the soup and our slices of beef was dry and bland.</li><li>Most of my friends ordered the biang biang or the spicy beef noodle as seen on yelp.</li><li>I like the beef and broccoli as well as the fried rice with shrimp and eggs.</li><li>It was really delicious when the beef was stuffed inside the bread.</li><li>Both were disappointing, especially the beef.</li><li>We complement our meal with Hot and Sour soup, dumplings, fried rice, and the crispy beef.</li><li>Then, we had an assortment of dishes including fried pork cutlets, fried green beans, tofu, beef and onion, Chicken with sprinkled garlic and for me, vegetarian dumplings ( but no meat).</li><li>Loved the fried string bean and beef too.</li><li>As a result, the beef was drowning in water and it tasted really bland.</li><li>The barbecue sauce was the right amount of sweetness to accompany the thin slices of beef.</li><li>The beef was braised nicely, the meat was tenderly split apart and not tough at all.</li><li>The beef was top quality and you can tell by how marbleized the meat was with fat.</li><li>My only qualm was that the beef was a bit low quality and had some tough, sinewy pieces in it.</li><li>A spicy beef, fried rice with pork in an clay pot ?</li><li>The beef and lamb combo was pretty tasty with a little kick of spice but not too hot.</li><li>I either get beef, spring rolls and vermicelli or pho.</li><li>I took the package to work and opened up the styrofoam container to find it brimming with shredded cabbage, some other stringed vegetable, herbs, bean sprouts, noodles, beef and some sort of ham.</li><li>The beef in the soup was n't right.</li><li>The beef and pork meat were so dry/tough/stale and not tasty.</li><li>I always getting the Pho rare beef and brisket which comes with plentiful meat and noodle, you can also definitely tell they 've stewed the soup base at least for a night or so.</li><li>The beef and egg were separated and sat nicely on the bed of rice.</li><li>Ordered the Combination Soon Tofu ( Beef, shrimp, mussels) with medium spicy.</li><li>The soup starts off with a refreshing beef taste and then the taste slowly deteriorated.</li><li>Combination Soon Tofu + Dolsotbab ( Beef, Shrimp, Mussel, $ 7.08) had a great broth as the base and what else took it over and above Tofu Village was that the Beef was not sniff-able sized but were edible bites and more pieces than Tofu Village.</li><li>Combination Soon Tofu + Dolsotbab ( Beef, Shrimp, Mussel, $ 7.08) had a great broth as the base and what else took it over and above Tofu Village was that the Beef was not sniff-able sized but were edible bites and more pieces than Tofu Village.</li><li>Good comfort food- they mainly serve Korean tofu soup, comes with either seafood, dumplings, beef etc.</li><li>On top of mussels, beef, tofu, and other goodies, the combination comes with an egg that you crack and get to watch cook in your soup ( and eat it too)!</li><li>Nonetheless, I was willing to try something different so I ordered Kimchi Soon Tofu + Dolsotbab ( kimchi, beef, pork).</li><li>My dining companions ordered a similar dis but with beef, shrimp, and mussels.</li><li>The kimchi tofu was awesome with the mix of beef, pork and kimchi and I got it regular spicy which had just enough kick.</li><li>The beef was good as usual marinated to perfection as my little ones gobbled it up quickly.</li><li>There are only a few menu 's here, beef, mixed, seafood, bean paste ' soon tofu', comes with stone bowl rice and ' noo roong ji' afterwards. bi bim bap, bul gogi and some others which most of them are pretty good.</li><li>I had the BBQ beef with rice, and I personally thought the beef was too sweet, but some folk might like it that way.</li><li>My mainstay is the Kimchi Soon Tofu but hold the beef, ' cause I do mine veggie style!</li><li>I usually get number #4 which is soon tofu with beef and dumplings with mild spice.</li><li>Cheap thin slices of beef were used compared to other Korean restaurants.</li><li>The soon tofu is served with your choice of beef, seafood, or dumplings, and comes with a bowl of purple rice in a stone bowl.</li><li>#8 on the menu was the beef was extremely sweet.</li><li>I do n't like sweet food, it had beef and glass noodles and my mouth was burning because it was so sweet.</li><li>Also, the combination tofu is described as having beef, shrimp and mussel ( sic) and as we joked, they were very accurate in their description.</li><li>The beef is marinated well for the bulgogi.</li><li>Then you pick your meat ( chicken, beef, pulled pork, pulled beef, fish and shrimp) and toppings ( four salsas, cheese, beans, sour cream, lettuce).</li><li>All three were good, but the beef was my least favourite.</li><li>I had a large rare beef and tripe pho, and an order of fresh roll pho broth: good flavour and not too greasy portion: good amount of noodle, could have used more beef and tripe for large size bowl.</li><li>I had a large rare beef and tripe pho, and an order of fresh roll pho broth: good flavour and not too greasy portion: good amount of noodle, could have used more beef and tripe for large size bowl.</li><li>Pho was very good, beef was pink when it came out.</li><li>The soup was mildly spicy and the beef was perfect.</li><li>The wontons are a good size and the beef is really tender.</li><li>The beef there was definitely on the lower end and the fish balls had bones in it.</li><li>The beef had very little taste, and needed to douse it in hot sauce- Pork cutlet bibimbap had a generous portion of meat.</li><li>I 've often brought friends and suggested they order some meat katsu, bulgogi, kan poong ki ( sweet &amp; spicy chicken) or bi bim bap ( veggies, rice, beef, fried egg, &amp; spicy sauce).</li><li>They only have beef ...

Now I 'm questioning every item on their menu.Well, do n't be like me.Just do n't eat their food.Find something else. went there with a friend for lunch, it was buffet. the place was quite small but with a lot of places to sit! they have large tables too! the service was great, fast and friendly people. the buffet include: one soup 2 or 3 salad options many dips and sauces 1 rice 3-4 kind of vegetable dishes 5-6 meat dishes ( include chicken, lamb, beef, shrimps) they also have bread ( nan) and appetizers ( could not remember the names) they also have desserts ( 2 kinds) and fruits the taste was very good and not too spicy, however they have really extreme spicy sauces! the price was around 10 dollars as a neighborhood restaurant it one of the best options in the area and for sure I 'll be back:) This is a late review, I 've been a bit behind with all my travels = D I 've been to this place twice and the first time it was meh, I did n't even want to bother with a review.</li><li>Yes it 's a bowl of soup, but it is n't no frills though- it comes with fresh seaweed, a slice of turnip, half an egg, and few pieces beef.</li><li>Aroma- breathe in the salt and seaweed, you can readily exfoliate your face with the steam.:) Taste- noodles cooked with the right amount of chewiness, it soaks the flavours of the soup base nicely, beef was ample, it was very tender in the soup, the half egg cooked about right and not over done.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
