<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 6' %><h2>sushi<br />occurrence: 735</h2><div><ol><li>Me and my sister ordered sushi boat A and shrimp tempura.</li><li>Best all you can eat with great portions and very fresh sushi.</li><li>My friend recommended this place for our weekly dinner as sushi was the pick.</li><li>But I still prefer just ordering one of their sushi boats or a bento box.</li><li>I would n't say this was good sushi.</li><li>The sushi was not bad but not the bad I 've had.</li><li>Dinner for AYCE is $ 19.95 weekdays so it 's the average price for most AYCE sushi for dinner.</li><li>Ive been to all of the sushi in the neighbourhood and this one is certainly better than many of the other ones ... perhaps Sushi One is probably on par with this restaurant.</li><li>Ive been to all of the sushi in the neighbourhood and this one is certainly better than many of the other ones ... perhaps Sushi One is probably on par with this restaurant.</li><li>The quality of the sushi was top notch.</li><li>One of my favourite places for good, affordable sushi!</li><li>Been going here for a few years now and it 's always a safe bet for above average sushi.</li><li>-They do n't have squid/octopus/mackerel sushi.</li><li>Overall if you 're not craving high end sushi, or you want AYCE sushi in the Yonge/Sheppard area, this is not a bad choice.</li><li>The box includes 9 pcs of sashimi, 4 pieces of sushi, soup, salad, rice, vegetable tempura and lobster tail tempura, all for $ 13.95 + tax.</li><li>Mediocre food ( obviously not authentic), limited choice of sushi.</li><li>This is a great sushi places if you are looking for affordable sushi.</li><li>This is a great sushi places if you are looking for affordable sushi.</li><li>This place is very casual, good to chill with friends or coworkers or in general a good inexpensive sushi place.</li><li>Sushi is fresh with that soft melt in your mouth texture.</li><li>I can have slightly higher quality sushi ( not to say Sakura is poor quality) in other restaurants but I 'm likely going to get less food and pay more money.</li><li>Now, anytime we 're in the ' hood, it 's our go-to place for affordable Sushi, Bento and Korean.</li><li>I was thinking that is quite big .. and where are my sushi!</li><li>I want my sushi !!</li><li>- Sushi was so so ... especially the rolls were not too good.</li><li>I got the Bulgogi Bento which included miso soup, salad, rice, salmon rolls and sushi.</li><li>I love the sushi they make, they are sooo delicious and really cheap.</li><li>I used to live right across the street and went there really often, trying almost all sushi they have.</li><li>The Manti- Bucharian beef and lamb dumplings were outstanding The Last Samurai Sushi was soo good my wife decided to take another one home ... she said that it was the best sushi she had ever had in Toronto!</li><li>This is one of the best sushi restaurants I 've been to in Toronto.</li><li>But the sushi is outstanding.</li><li>The sushi is great, especially the spider roll.</li><li>At this point, I thought they were actually going to give me spicy sushi, which a lot of places do.</li><li>I 've been for both AYCE and a la carts ( with a groupon) The food here is average sushi fare.</li><li>This was n't my first time here but since the last time the sushi has gotten significantly worse.</li><li>I think that 's why their sushi is not very fresh.</li><li>16 dollars .. i am a sushi lover and i have been to many if not almost all the ayce sushi places in GTA ... i can tell you this place cuts the THINNEST sashimi i have ever seen. salmon is transparent ..</li><li>This place definitely had competition since just more down the street south of Finch, theres Sushi Legend which I believe alot more people are going.</li><li>It was OK for all you can eat sushi and had lots of dishes to choose from.</li><li>Mediocre sushi.</li><li>And I said `` because I wanna takeaway and do n't waste '' and she said ' how much do you think the price of the sushi ?'</li><li>Do you think a dollar can pay for the sushi ? $ 1 per each does make sense!"</li><li>No sashimi at lunch, but at least the amount of rice in a sushi wasnt that much.</li><li>One of the best sushi buffets around where I live.</li><li>I do n't think I 'll return unless they can get the staples ( e.g. sushi and sashimi) right.</li><li>My friend and I split a small sushi and sashimi combo boat ....</li><li>Many places I have been to I do n't mind eating the sashimi ( ichiban, takara bune) but here you really enjoy the salmon tuna and hamachi ... if you go to ayce sushi places and think ur eating good sushi you are definitely not ....</li><li>This place is actually quite a good bar, but it is also a nice place to get some sushi.</li><li>I had a selection of appetizers, sushi, sashimi and a spider roll.</li><li>The amount and variety of sushi was on par as well.</li><li>Sushi Moto is an Asian sportsbar--just like Crazy Wingz--only they served sushi.</li><li>It 's like Milestones decided to serve sushi but kept all their pretentious prices.</li><li>Now onto the food, I do n't know why but it feels like I 've been lied to all my life and the sushi we had at sushi moto is what it should have been all along; the miso soup was great and the beef teriyaki was tender and full of flavour.</li><li>Best sushi in the city!</li><li>Sushi is good and presentation is pretty.</li><li>We ordered the Matsu sushi combo and it had salmon, snapper, tuna nigiri and a California and salmon roll.</li><li>Sushi Moto is a more upscale sushi experience, rather than your cheap sushi spot around the corner.</li><li>Best sushi in the area.</li><li>The sushi is quite good.</li><li>Really great sushi and other japanese food.</li><li>But it 's also a nice place to get some sushi, japanese cuisine, etc.</li><li>I looked up late night sushi for toronto, and apparently Sushi Moto opens until 2am on weekends.</li><li>- My first impression when I saw and bit into the sushi was that `` wow that 's a massive piece of sushi.</li><li>When I took a look at the second piece of sushi and then turned it over as I dipped the piece into some soy sauce, I realized it was actually TWO layers of fish.</li><li>- From the picture, you 'll see that the two pieces look different ( they put some stuff on top of the sushi and it 's gone in one of them).</li><li>This place might become my go to place for late night sushi cravings.</li><li>As sushi &amp; Sashimi Experts know, it is hard to taste high quality of sushi and sashimi for just $ $ price level.</li><li>As sushi &amp; Sashimi Experts know, it is hard to taste high quality of sushi and sashimi for just $ $ price level.</li><li>Fantastic customer service, as well as delicious fresh sushi!</li><li>Really great sushi with a unique quality I ca n't place, but that makes it distinct from other sushi I 've had.</li><li>Really great sushi with a unique quality I ca n't place, but that makes it distinct from other sushi I 've had.</li><li>The sushi place has very nice interior, with a bar.</li><li>I would recommend this place if you have a late night sushi craving!</li><li>I 've been here once and ordered a large sushi and sashimi platter and a bento box.</li><li>The sushi we ordered was delicious.</li><li>I felt that the total bill was on the higher side for standard issue sushi.</li><li>Great quality sushi, fun for occasions with a group or a romantic night out for dinner and drinks.</li><li>I really like the food, I had the best sushi and maki rolls here .the only reason that my review is 4star is, the rest room area and washrooms was `` Very'' dirty.</li><li>Overall, this sushi resto is worth the drive if you are not in the area!</li><li>One of the best sushi places.</li><li>We went on a Sunday ( I 've heard sushi should n't be eaten on a sunday) and we did n't do the best job ordering food.</li><li>PPS: My search for above average sushi in Toronto continues.</li><li>It 's much more expensive than your average sushi place but it also tastes much better than it too.</li><li>My favourite dynamite roll is always perfectly done, sushi is always fresh, the hae-dup-bap is awesome.</li><li>One time they forgot the water and I had to ask someone else so that 's why I give it 4/5 but other than that good place! we stopped by for lunch today. the decor looked fancy, i like the environment. the price tag is a bit on the expensive side. you 're looking at 20-30 dollars easy per person. i do like their quality of food. we had some salmon and tuna nigiris and they were pretty fresh! the staff there are attentive. cute place! although this place was suggested by my cousin ( because his friend owns the place), i was unimpressed by their sushi/sashimi. it was n't fresh! yes, the place is nice, trendy and huge, but i would n't go here for their sushi.</li><li>All the way from the miso soup, salad, all the way to the sushi and sashimi.</li><li>I went here with a friend, and ordered the small sushi set which was $ 30 ( admittedly it was also 27 pieces- not so small).</li><li>This is the sushi place my dad now frequents regularly with his family, and I can totally see the appeal.</li><li>At the end of the day, if you 're coming out to Sushi Moto Wine and Sake Bar, you 're some kinda yuppie with some kinda money to burn, and you wanna sit in a fancy looking place to have sushi that you could have eaten for half the price at Sushi Bong down the street- and really almost any other sushi joints in the area.</li><li>They have wide selection of wine and sake ( although sushi and wine sounds weird) and would prefer it if you sat down and had continued to drink all night long.</li><li>It 's too bad because the sushi that came was absolutely amazing.</li><li>This is a very nice sushi restaurant.</li><li>Visited Sushi Moto with a friend, and was quite impressed: good quality sushi and solid service.</li><li>We ordered a small sushi combo ( 24 pieces of nigri + 18 pieces of maki) to start and split, as well as 750mL of the cold house sake.</li><li>In addition, there was a solid variety of fish offered in the small sushi combo, though I would have loved to have seen even more variety.</li><li>I could binge on a huge bowl of that, but then i would n't have any room left for their fab sushi!</li><li>Definitely recommend trying out! this is a great place to have good quality fresh sushi The best thing I like about this restaurant is the service is quick the location is good and the hours of operation are long the restaurant typically opens until 2 o' clock in the morning on the weekends and at least till midnight during the weekdays The one thing that impressed me the most about this restaurant is that management is very hands on they will always make sure that you are greeted right away and they always say thank you for your business at the end.</li><li>Just had sushi at sushi moto.</li><li>Mediocre sushi and i am not impressed.</li><li>The price for the sushi is about 1 dollar per piece and it 's not cheaper if u order larger amount.</li><li>Came here today and ordered their small Sashimi, Sushi, Maki combo.</li><li>Probably will not be back here again. nice service good sushi ...</li><li>Every time I come to Moto sushi I always get great service, fish is fresh and atmosphere is really cool.</li><li>Sushi was decent, again, I find most places in the GTA just mediocre, so Sushi Moto may impress you depending on your expectation/experience.</li><li>My husband and I are both serious sushi snobs, so we did n't set our standards too high coming into the `` sports bar/sake bar'' Sushi Moto -- but wow, were we ever pleasantly surprised.</li><li>My husband and I are both serious sushi snobs, so we did n't set our standards too high coming into the `` sports bar/sake bar'' Sushi Moto -- but wow, were we ever pleasantly surprised.</li><li>As for the sushi itself, this is n't top tier sushi, but it is n't trying to be: it 's VERY well made, mid range sushi.</li><li>Some might call the rolls small, but this is the size sushi is supposed to be -- if you have to bite into it, or it 's a struggle to put in your mouth, it 's not thoughtfully made sushi.</li><li>Sushi is some of the best in the neighborhood and pretty consistant.</li><li>Amazing sushi selection, at very reasonable prices!</li><li>Now for the sushi, I 'm not especially thrilled by their maki, somehow they are always average, I almost cannot tell the difference between dragon roll and California.</li><li>Sushi is ok, but nothing remarkable.</li><li>I think this area has more than its fair share of sushi and Japanese-Korean infusion restaurants, so I 'm not sold on the concept.</li><li>The sushi was good, not extraordinary.</li><li>The best sushi I 've tried, hands down.</li><li>Exceptional sushi!</li><li>The reviews for here were fairly glowing but I thought this was a pretty mediocre restaurant, both in the sushi and the service.</li><li>I sat at the sushi bar, since I was alone, and it took forever ( at least 15 minutes) to even be greeted by a server, despite the fact that I was literally sitting right next to where they grabbed the sushi from to take to other tables.</li><li>I only had sushi, but it was not that great for me.</li><li>I travel a lot so I 've become somewhat critical of sushi and though the fish itself was quite fresh, the overpowering sweetness of the rice made this sushi something I would n't consider even trying again.</li><li>Sushi moto is our go to sushi place The sushi is always fresh, service is always quick We come here once every week or 2 and are always happy with everything I love their maki- lots of creative options- my personal faves are the fire roll, Cali roll, tiger 's tail and dynamite Their tempura is fresh and not too breaded My husband really likes the chirashi- the fish is very fresh and the selection is good too We regularly also get the maki combo 1 for dinner- it 's a great deal and it 's enough for 2 people I also love their complimentary soup.</li><li>This place is amazing the sushi is always fresh and it 's ALWAYS packed with people.</li><li>Price of sushi was a little on the higher side.</li><li>I liked the atmosphere- more classy than the average sushi joint.</li><li>The sushi was just average.</li><li>Woah I 'm stuffed. the manager and servers are very friendly and attentive. we tried toro ( bluefin tuna) sashimi, and it tasted so good. it 's just very pricey ( $ 19.95, usually $ 24.95). i ordered chirasu lunch ( rice with various kinds of sashimi) as main course and all the sashimi were very fresh and well served. would definitely go back there again to try their sushi combo.</li><li>The food hits the spot when you 're craving some good sushi.</li><li>Pretty good sushi, but pricy for the type of sushi.</li><li>Pretty good sushi, but pricy for the type of sushi.</li><li>The sushi is so good, and there are all kinds of dishes that are all original.</li><li>Great sushi.</li><li>The sushi is very fresh and tasty.</li><li>I randomly walked in here with a friend last month and we were both blown away by the quality of sushi here ..</li><li>We also tried the blue fin tuna tartar only offered on weekends, the lion roll, crazy roll and the small sushi and maki combo.</li><li>Sushi moto offers consistent quality and the fact that they are open till 2 a.m. will make it our go to place for a late night sushi craving.</li><li>We got one of the sushi &amp; sashimi boats and requested it to be gluten free and they were very accommodating.</li><li>My 5 stars definitely went toward the service, but I would definitely come back to try the sushi!</li><li>The quality of sushi and sashimi is simply a cut above your average sushi place.</li><li>The quality of sushi and sashimi is simply a cut above your average sushi place.</li><li>Their sushi has been always fresh and generous in the size of the cut.</li><li>My usual order is the Shrimp and Veggie Tempura ( one of the better ones in the city), the Cold Soba Noodle, the Sushi and Sashimi combos and ...</li><li>Came here for lunch as I was craving fresh sushi!</li><li>My sushi was delicious!</li><li>The sushi bar is excellent for the following reasons: a) the seats are comfortable and have backs so you can hang your coat, b) they are high enough so that you 're not looking up at the sushi cooler and c) the activity behind the bar is theatrical.</li><li>You ca n't go wrong at Sushi Moto. excellent sushi and maki, however the time to get the food served was a little bit too long, while the shop was n't very busy yet at the time we visited.</li><li>You ca n't go wrong at Sushi Moto. excellent sushi and maki, however the time to get the food served was a little bit too long, while the shop was n't very busy yet at the time we visited.</li><li>The sushi is always fresh and they always serve quality fish with a good variety.</li><li>You could go for AYCE sushi but would n't get the same level of quality or variety.</li><li>This restaurant has ABSOLUTELY spoilt me- best sushi and Japanese cuisine I have ever had!</li><li>Wonderful sushi quality and I love their complimentary noodle crunch soup.</li><li>It hard to have your mediocre sushi with worse wasabi.</li><li>We ordered a sushi boat and I was not impressed with the quality of the sushi, given the higher price tag.</li><li>However average sushi for an above average price wo n't have me coming back any time soon.</li><li>Main entree course ( sushi and sashimi) was prepared in advance and left to sit on top of the cooler, as opposed to inside of it.</li><li>I always get the sushi, sashimi, and maki boats, which is great if you want to try many different types of fish.</li><li>Amazing but expensive sushi.</li><li>Holy sushi!</li><li>From the gigantic salads to the delicious sushi, this place is worth the trip up!</li><li>3.5/5- Sushi is my Moto in life.</li><li>Especially loved the sashimi and the handrolls are just bomb, then again, I do love me any type of sushi and its the closest one to my house so that 's a definite plus.</li><li>This is the most hippest sushi restaurant/lounge/bar I have ever dined in!</li><li>Good sushi at a decent price, service can be better but it was a busy night so I 'll forgive their slack.</li><li>Sushi was done right, sign of a skilled sushi chef and staff.</li><li>Best sushi I 've had in Toronto!</li><li>It came with 18 pieces of sushi, which included 6 pieces of California sushi, 6 pieces of Kim-chi sushi, and 6 pieces of tempura shrimp sushi.</li><li>You can taste the stinky fish smell in the sushi ..</li><li>The sushi was really good and the fish was fresh.</li><li>I would give the sushi a 3.4 star rating.</li><li>For a restaurant that does n't specialize in sushi they did a great job.</li><li>The food is good and sushi are fresh.</li><li>The food is good and its value for money just under $ 20 you could eat to your hearts content from the assortment of sushi to a variety of Thai Chinese Japanese and Korean meals.</li><li>Anyway, the AYCE menu is amazing because, surprisingly, they have GOOD sushi with very little rice and a lot of stuff.</li><li>My friend ordered sushi and the salmon was n't fresh.</li><li>I was advised by a co-worker to not order the sushi.</li><li>I do n't want to knock the place for my one dish, but the sushi is not recommended.</li><li>Ordered the Jumbo sushi platter which included more than 100 pieces of Sushi &amp; Sashimi.</li><li>Ordered the Jumbo sushi platter which included more than 100 pieces of Sushi &amp; Sashimi.</li><li>However, I could not write a review based on their Korean BBQ, as I have tried their sushi and Korean Cold Noodles.</li><li>Quality of sushi is amazing, they have unique and tasty rolls, good service, and you can sit back and relax for as long as you like.</li><li>So that brings us to the sushi itself ... it was great!</li><li>Ordered chicken teriyaki and pork katsu, as husband does not like sushi.</li><li>The sushi was decent and average.</li><li>I know Moto sushi is a hot spot in town.</li><li>The sushi sported a generous amount of fish to rice ratio.</li><li>And I must admit, I really like their sushi.</li><li>I 've had some sushi from other restaurants that as soon as you touch the sushi it falls apart.</li><li>But their sushi is a tad more expensive than some places.</li><li>Nice sushi and good udon.</li><li>I wish I lived in the building across the street to have sushi whenever I pleased.</li><li>Sushi can be made seared lightly here, I love them!</li><li>I came for takeout and their sushi was alright.</li><li>The seaweed that wrapped around the sushi was a bit chewy and some pieces were quite big to fit into one bite.</li><li>The price is average, a little higher for some but I felt it was worth the quality of sushi I received.</li><li>The only reason I did n't rate them a full 5 stars is because they use regular soy sauce to season the sushi on the Tokyo platter and the sodium level was much too high for my liking.</li><li>I think they make great sushi and it was $ 18 for everything.</li><li>Although I enjoy their sushi, their cooked dishes are TERRIBLE.</li><li>The rolls were just what you expect to get at almost any decent sushi place.</li><li>Although pricy ( about $ 20 with tip) and not exactly filling, the quality of the sushi goes unmatched in my memory.</li><li>Tried couple of sushi ( lunch combo B) that includes 3 sushi rolls, miso soup and small salad.</li><li>I did not like any of the sushi, Kiyomizu roll was my least favorite.</li><li>A good sushi place is defined by their sushi quality first.</li><li>When you consider that a lot of upscale sushi places are charging you an arm and a leg for superficial reasons, it actually makes the prices here seem worthwhile.</li><li>In the sushi lovers ' haven that is the Yonge &amp; Sheppard area, this is a hidden gem.</li><li>Four stars instead of five only because of the small service lapse mentioned above, as well as the high price for veggie tempura ( $ 8 for about 6 pieces of yam seemed excessive- Hockey Sushi will give you 8 for $ 3!).</li><li>I would come back again if I am in the area to try the sushi.</li><li>Everything else like the sushi, sashimi, chicken terriyaki were terrible in my bento box I had for lunch they did n't look or taste fresh.</li><li>But it is a decent ambience and the sushi is pretty decent.</li><li>For a small Japanese/Korean mom and pop joint the sushi was pretty fresh.</li><li>Would def go again for their sushi.</li><li>This is where I go when I want good sushi, and it 's at sheppard!</li><li>I know my sushi ...</li><li>Excellent variety of food and sushi and the space is cozy but inviting.</li><li>Sushi is my forte.</li><li>I love sushi, I live for sushi and I seek out great sushi.</li><li>I love sushi, I live for sushi and I seek out great sushi.</li><li>This is the original place I had my first taste of sushi as a child.</li><li>I did not leave with a full belly but left pretty satisfied. ordered the black dragon roll for takeout huge roll but drenched in sauce it was also really warm felt like i was eating an unagi don rather than sushi.</li><li>I have n't tried the sushi yet, but it looks good.</li><li>The sushi is to die for, we ordered an extra plate ( even thought we wouldnt eat it) JUST so we could take it home !!</li><li>The quality of sushi and sashimi on the boat was just average, nothing special or disappointing.</li><li>BUT I recommend going somewhere else for better sushi if you do n't mind paying a bit more or a cheaper takeout sushi places for the same quality sushi.</li><li>Sushi is incredible with a huge variety to choose from.</li><li>Their sushi is always fresh and their hot items are equally delicious.</li><li>I would recommend an appetizer, the Kalbi ribs and a sushi/ sashimi platter to share for a party of 2-3.</li><li>We ordered a boat and it came with sushi, sashimi and a California roll.</li><li>They 're sushi was just average, nothing special in particular, the regulars you get at any other restaurant.</li><li>In fact it is a complete throw back to the look of the older established sushi restaurants I first came in contact with back in the late 80 's and early 90 's.</li><li>She vouched for the sushi set lunch but I was royally disappointed when I asked for the vegetable maki set ( $ 9.95) and they gave me giant maki rolls filled with ... ugh, lettuce.</li><li>The booths are very spacious and I do n't feel cramped at all ( unlike most neighbourhood sushi restaurants) The food prices are fair too.</li><li>It 's a combination of sushi, tempura and korean dish.</li><li>Food is promptly brought to you and from the times I 've been there, the staff is always checking up to make sure your tea is filled; the hostess comes by to check on you; even the sushi chef/owner comes by to say hi ( obviously, when it 's not too busy).</li><li>You get a healthy portion of fish no matter what you 're ordering and the fish/rice ration is perfect for sushi.</li><li>My other friend ordered a mix of sushi and sashmi.</li><li>Their sushi comes with a side of cold Korean appetizers which are quite good.</li><li>Excellent sushi, soups and bim bim bop.</li><li>Sushi is fresh and delicious.</li><li>Sushi and Sashimi- Small and sloppy, never seen such small sushi pieces in the city.</li><li>Wont be running back here, the chef needs to take pride in the sushi he is making, and not put out such small rolls.</li><li>The sushi is great, very good sushi rice and everything is fresh.</li><li>I 've been to soooo many good sushi places ... and I 'm sorry to say that this was one of the worst japanese restaurants ever been to ...</li><li>First of all the fish/sushi was not fresh fish at all seems as though the server quickly brought it to us so I 'm assuming it was prepared hours ago or maybe even day ( s) old as in the sushi was sitting around for a while ...</li><li>The sushi was great.</li><li>I 'll definitely be back the next time I am in Toronto, in addition to the sushi they have a really interesting Korean seafood menu with a few items on it that I would love to try.</li><li>The sushi and sashimi were fresh and very well prepared.</li><li>It has a variety of small plates ( soup and salad, sushi, sashimi, tempura, ginger chicken, terriyaki beef or salmon, terriyaki veggies, fried rice or udon, etc) for twenty something dollars.</li><li>The sushi is n't the best in terms of how it was rolled, but they stuff those things incredibly full of spicy salmon and stuff, so I would n't be surprised if they burst when they tried to cut them.</li><li>The sushi is fresh.</li><li>I was craving sushi and let 's face it you ca n't just have few pieces:-) I came for lunch so I ca n't review sashimi.</li><li>The food here is great too, I especially like how their sushi, rolls and hand rolls are not stuffed with excessive rice like most AYCE places!</li><li>Yo, I had the most amazing sushi in China, at one of those rotating belt restaurants, so my expectation really ai n't high now that I 'm back in Canada.</li><li>It 's all you can eat, and the sushi ( for now) is reasonably fresh and well prepared.</li><li>Their sushi is a little smaller than other places though but I 'm not complaining.</li><li>On my last visit, I noticed the new addition of aburi/torched sushi on their menu as well.</li><li>The yuzu salmon sashimi and beef tataki sashimi dishes are the standout dishes that Sushi Legend has chosen to set them apart in the competitive world of AYCE japanese in Toronto.</li><li>Besides Kaka, this will now be my go-to place for AYCE sushi.</li><li>Food: Go for the torched and pressed sushi.</li><li>Kaka, torched sushi at JaBistro, etc).</li><li>It did n't matter what we ordered, the presentation and size of the sushi was just so unappetizing.</li><li>Conclusion: If you 're in the area, want sushi, and have a lot of time to kill, or want a lot of time to chat with friends over a meal, it 's definitely an option.</li><li>I do not like AYCE because of the lack of quality, the uncreative cookie cutter rolls and dishes BUT sushi legend actually wowed me.</li><li>Mild taste and not chewy at all- Chicken wing skewer- biased, I love chicken wings The sushi was fine, but nothing really jumped out at me.</li><li>Whenever I am in NY with my boyfriend, we tend to always stop by Sushi Legend for some AYCE sushi.</li><li>They have a wide variety of sushi, rolls, appetizers, grilled, and desserts ( the dessert menu is great).</li><li>One of the many things that I like about this place is that the size of the sushi is not huge like other AYCE, which allows for more space to try other different types of sushi.</li><li>One of the many things that I like about this place is that the size of the sushi is not huge like other AYCE, which allows for more space to try other different types of sushi.</li><li>They do n't stack the sushi on a huge pile of rice.</li><li>Honestly it 's a typical all you can eat sushi, I 've had better.</li><li>Sashimi and sushi are all very fresh.</li><li>For AYCE sushi this is one of the best options in the area.</li><li>Somehow although sushi legend has opened close to a year, none of them has heard or noticed this place.</li><li>It had long hours which made it convenient and the sushi quality was delicious.</li><li>I think it is the best sushi ( all you can eat) restaurant in town.</li><li>Best sushi place so far.</li><li>The location is not as large as I would have expected with the name ' Sushi Legend', but there were still a good amount of tables.</li><li>However, this wo n't be my new go-to place for AYCE sushi.</li><li>The menu is much more limited than other places like 168 Asian Buffet and the salmon sushi could use a little more seasoning.</li><li>Overall, I 've found slightly better sushis in other AYCE like 168 Asian Buffet or Hockey Sushi.</li><li>Fresh fish and delicate sushi at an AYCE ?</li><li>The price they charge is a little higher than your regular sushi ayce. however the food is average. it is not amazing, it is not terrible, it is average.</li><li>Best sushi all you can eat in Toronto.</li><li>The food is good, sushi is great and the service was even better.</li><li>The sushi though aside from the salmon all tasted not super fresh, however the rolls are nicely made!</li><li>Food wise, this place is pretty decent, the Scallop Sashimi and the Squid ( Ika) Sushi are indeed the highlight of this restaurant!</li><li>They do have a great variety of sushi, sashimi and hot food and based on the items I ordered in my three visits, they are all very decent.</li><li>The items I would highly recommend as a MUST try are: Scallop Sashimi, Squid ( Ika) Sushi and Beef Tataki.</li><li>Decent food, sushi was whatever but I enjoyed the warm dishes.</li><li>Have eaten a lot of N. A. Sushi in Toronto and this is one of the best there is.</li><li>I love sushi, and have been to quite a number of AYCE sushi restaurants.</li><li>So when I try out a new AYCE place, I judge it based on the quality of the sashimi, and the variety of sashimi and sushi.</li><li>However, what I thought really stood out about Sushi Legend is that they offer seared and pressed sushi, which I thought was really yummy!</li><li>For those of you who like dessert, Sushi Legend offers quite a few selections!</li><li>Their sushi is done very well with attention to details.</li><li>Since I love sushi, especially AYCE, my friend brought me here for lunch.</li><li>The sushi was really bad and it was missing something- I do n't know what.</li><li>I do n't know what specifically caused it, but I know for a fact ( from a doctors perspective) that it was from the sushi. i 've had sushi at SO many places and I 've never had anything like this before.</li><li>The portion sizes are small, which I find better for AYCE, and the sushi is fresh.</li><li>Great sushi!</li><li>IMO take the travel uptown if your really eager for some AYCE sushi and better quality.</li><li>Sushi was well-rolled, not falling apart, sloppy, or just plopped on the dish.</li><li>I went for the all you can eat sushi during lunchtime.</li><li>The rice for the sushi was mushy, and the white tuna sashimi was not so white.</li><li>Desserts come in shot glasses so we ordered about 20 ...:) The sushi is pretty fresh by Toronto standards- especially the salmon.</li><li>The only place I think AYCE sushi is worth its value is this place.</li><li>The quality of the sushi is top notch for all you can eat.</li><li>Best AYCE sushi in town!</li><li>I like hang out sushi AYCE or other Buffets for lunch alone on every Saturday.</li><li>The sushi and maki rolls were not stuffed with lot of rice, unlike other places, which was good.</li><li>Overall, this AYCE serves good quality sashimi, sushi, rolls and grills.</li><li>I gave up on AYCE sushi a long time ago because every time i go its just an overload of low quality sushi but this place has some pretty awesome food.</li><li>Fresh sashimi, non soggy sushi and good variety of appetizers. most importantly, the only AYCE i know that has scallop sashimi!</li><li>We indulged in our fair share of sushi.</li><li>The sushi was fresher than most of these sushi buffets, and I was impressed with the hot foods as well.</li><li>I liked the sunny sushi roll ( great for spicy sushi lovers).</li><li>Great AYCE sushi.</li><li>Have some business sense. the best sushi ever, the most unique rolls, quality ingredients, excellent staff and service, must come back !! puts sushi on the level of heaven.</li><li>There is a wide selection of sashimi, sushi, seared sushi, cooked ( pan fried) plates, tempura, grilled meats, soups, salad, and dessert.</li><li>There is a wide selection of sashimi, sushi, seared sushi, cooked ( pan fried) plates, tempura, grilled meats, soups, salad, and dessert.</li><li>Listen, their sashimi is fresh as always, the sushi is always on point, the cooked items are flavored to perfection, and the salads are better than most.</li><li>They also like to put mayo on a lot of items so if you like your sushi neat, you can ask them not to put mayo.</li><li>But watch out for fried stuff and starch dishes ( all the sushi is rice heavy), those will add up quickly in your belly.</li><li>A ton of variety and a few standout dishes including: the Sushi Legend Fried Rice, the Spicy Scallop Sushi, Beef Tataki, and their Specialty Salmon Sashimi Dish.</li><li>And I usually like to see through the sushi bar to watch how they make all kinds of sushi but the layout of this restaurant limits you doing that.</li><li>Overall, it 's a good restaurant but I do n't think their sushi is made by any Japanese chief.</li><li>Above average AYCE sushi.</li><li>The AYCE menu is pretty long- lots of options between sashimi, sushi and hot food.</li><li>We had quite a variety- sushi, sashimi, tempura, beef ribs and enoki mushrooms wrapped in beef.</li><li>The sushi here is absolutely amazing when my friends and I say let 's go to sushi we just know where to go.</li><li>The sushi here is absolutely amazing when my friends and I say let 's go to sushi we just know where to go.</li><li>Worst sushi I 've ever had.</li><li>Every sushi was different in size, and they were falling apart.</li><li>This has become my new local sushi place. korean style beef ribs and salmon sashimis is very good there!</li><li>From bean curd soup, pork katsu, sushi, sashimi, kalbi, bulgogi, bento boxes, amazing tempura Udon and much much more. + + + + the atmosphere is cozy and quiet despite being right beside Sheppard ave. Great friendly service from this Korean owned restaurant!</li><li>Even though this is supposedly a sushi place, I already have my favourite spots for good sushi so this is simply one of my go-to spots for breaded deep-fried pork cutlet-y goodness!</li><li>I have a feeling they use Korean rice ( on their sushi too.</li><li>I think anytime you review a sushi place the vital importance of it should be the quality and freshness of the sushi itself and this place has it.</li><li>The sushi here is always fresh and always flavorful.</li><li>If you are looking for average quality sushi, and hit or miss service, with above average prices for what you get then you have found your place.</li><li>The quality is amazing and the sushi is good portion.</li><li>This is one of those worst place to have sashimi and sushi.</li><li>Great sushi as usual.</li><li>However, the sushi here is pretty good.</li><li>Overall, if you do n't mind spending a little more money for some very fresh sushi, then come here.</li><li>Really not worth it if you drive here but for a local it may be alright place to walk to, to get your sushi fix.</li><li>It used to be a reliable place for me to get fresh sushi ( Chirashi Sushi) at reasonable prices.</li><li>Decent Japanese and comparable to most cheap sushi restaurants like the ones you 'd find in the Annex or Queen St. Nothing really stands out, in a good or bad way.</li><li>I enjoyed their food a lot, they had good quality sushi at a reasonable price.</li><li>Their sushi is pretty decent and they have a pretty good variety.</li><li>The sushi is very reasonably priced, and tastes fresh.</li><li>Overall, you 'll have a satisfying sushi experience and you wo n't pay too much if you order smartly.</li><li>Ichiban 's sushi is actually pretty good and their pricing is also great but my beef with this place lies with the wait staff.</li><li>We had sashimi, sushi and maki rolls.</li><li>Great place and fresh sushi!</li><li>Sashimi is a bit pricey but for the most part the cost is n't anything above the average sushi place.</li><li>On to the sushi: the chicken and beef sushi was absolutely the worst Ive ever tasted.</li><li>It was the best delivery sushi we had ever had!</li><li>Considering how much you can spend when you go out for sushi we find them very reasonably priced and will continue to frequent this place both in house and ordering for delivery.</li><li>It 's immediately obvious that the sashimi and sushi are not fresh or the best quality; in fact, the white fish must 've been previously frozen judging by the spongey texture.</li><li>My friend took me here for AYCE sushi- a coworker told him this place was really good.</li><li>Anyways, the sushi was n't too bad but I 've definetely had better and I will not be resturning to this place.</li><li>The food was quick and the staff were friendly The worst sushi I had was anything to do with salmon.</li><li>Sushi was terrible.</li><li>Sushi was good but I had to remove half of the rice from each piece.</li><li>Lastly, taste-wise, the sushi, sashimi, rolls and beef steaks were decent at best.</li><li>The sushi is really good and there is a wide variety of food.</li><li>Easily one of the worst AYCE sushi restaurants i have been to in my 3 years in Toronto.</li><li>Service was good but overall I go out for sushi for sushi and this place just did not deliver.</li><li>I do not believe this place is opened by Japanese, but their sushi and sashimi were actually not bad.</li><li>Quality of the sushi is very bad ... especially the maki rolls.</li><li>Ok so the sushi here is amazingly good.</li><li>The maki and sushi were delicious.</li><li>Other AYCE sushi restaurants will give you proper sushi and Miso Soup, for an even lower price ( 11.99 on most places for weekday lunch hours). bf and i came here last Sunday afternoon and had the gold menu for AYCE. it was less than average especially for the price, $ 21.99 on weekends and holidays and does not include drinks except for water and tea. this is the only AYCE place that comes out with our order of sashimi last. the most disappointing part was the food. salmon sushi were huge and sliced in cubes, steak cubes came in bits and pieces but was decent, buttered mushrooms were burnt, masago was too salty due to low quality, beef tataki was not fresh, i think the kalbi ribs were old cause they were so chewy i couldnt chew through them, spider roll was the worst! i couldnt even drink the tea cause the cups had such a strong bleach scent. needless to say, we will not be returning and would not recommend it to anyone.</li><li>I plan on coming back for some more all you can eat sushi.</li><li>Decent sushi Somewhat pricey Sashimi cut on the thin side Freshness of fish is good Will definitely order from them again, but due to the portion sizes and prices, will probably stop for all you can eat next time.</li><li>The Golden Menu has the best selection of sushi and it includes sashimi.</li><li>The food was mouth watering, absolutely delicious and the actual sushi was huge.</li><li>I would say the sushi is 7 out of 10 and price is 10 out of 10.</li><li>I usually get the dynamite roll ( one roll is probably enough for one person) and the sushi bong special and that is more than enough for my wife and I. Sushi Bong is amazing!</li><li>I usually get the dynamite roll ( one roll is probably enough for one person) and the sushi bong special and that is more than enough for my wife and I. Sushi Bong is amazing!</li><li>I have n't had cheap and delicious sushi in a long long time.</li><li>If you want good sushi at a low price, here is the place for you. cheap and huge rolls. better to take out bc they dont have many tables and the place is always busy with people coming and going for take out.</li><li>Where they fall short is on the technical side of the sushi itself.</li><li>Awesome place for reasonably priced, fresh, hand-rolled sushi.</li><li>I ordered sushi combo c which has twelve pcs of sushi and spicy salmon roll.</li><li>It is good if u want a quick sushi fix.</li><li>I usually get the Sushi Bong Special, and always to go, so no review for their sit-down.</li><li>I love Sushi Bong and think they make one of the best Sushis in Town, even my visiting Japanese friend agreed after we 've been to Sushi Kaji- which is supposed to be the best Sushi.</li><li>Quick service and pretty big generous portions for sushi.</li><li>Until then, I 'm looking for better sushi .... which should be very easy.</li><li>The size of the sushi here is enormous!</li><li>There is n't much of a wait time, the chefs make the sushi fairly fast even when there 's a huge line.</li><li>Overall, the sushi is n't amazing, but it 's decent and worth the value.</li><li>It 's convenient for me since I live around the area, but it 's definitely worth a try just to see the size of the sushi!</li><li>It is the best sushi in town- they have great quality and quantity of sushi for a decent price.</li><li>Although the place is tiny, and sometimes the services are mildly inadequate, you still get the perfect sushi you want.</li><li>Beside being fresh and delicious, the sushi here actually fill you up.</li><li>I have always been a big fan to this place since few years ago- their sushi is just irresistible.</li><li>I have been a frequent customer at Sushi Bong for a good 4 years now and my four favourite things about this place is that the sushi is made at lightning speed ( literally like a fast food place), it 's very inexpensive when compared to other sushi restaurants, the portions are huge and filling and it 's always consistently good ( the specials that is).</li><li>She never smiles, has a slight attitude, seems like she 's always in a bad mood and looks as if she does n't wanna be there, but I put up with it because their sushi makes up for it, thank god.</li><li>Overall, minus some of the downsides, this is still one of my favourite go-to restaurants for when I need to get my sushi fix!</li><li>Food Quality &amp; Price: Decent sushi ( not the best) but for the price, you ca n't go wrong.</li><li>The Sushi Bong Special is amazing, so much food for that price ... definitely a great deal!</li><li>A good &amp; quick sushi fix.</li><li>Also love the spider roll and sushi bong special.</li><li>I had been a fan of Sushi Bong for a number of years for their cheap, filling ( i.e huge) and decent sushi.</li><li>In terms of quality, the sushi is always very good and fresh- likely due to the volume that this hole in the wall puts out.</li><li>Sushi bong is the perfect place to get cheap sushi, and for its price it is still really good.</li><li>Although not advertised you could substitute the California roll in their sushi bong special for roughly an additional $ 2.</li><li>This is a great deal and is definitely perfect when you 're feeling sushi on a budget.</li><li>Cant go wrong for the price you pay for your sushi.</li><li>I ordered the small sushi which included 20piece sushi and 1 dynamite roll for $ 20.</li><li>I 've ordered from this place multiple times, and most of the sushi has been great of those times.</li><li>Their sushi is pretty decent, the price is pretty awesome.</li><li>Not exactly THE best sushi, but for the price you get quite a bit and the prices are huge.</li><li>I used to love this place and it used to be my go-to sushi takeout place!</li><li>Sushi Bong is the place to go if you want decent and cheap sushi.</li><li>The Sushi Bong Special ( $ 9.50) is well worth it as well as the spider roll.</li><li>Sushi is average not amazing but I rather go to other places if I want something more authentic and has more space for dine-in.</li><li>And this location was more closer to me than the other sushi bong.</li><li>We ended up ordering the sushi bong special and the dynamite roll.</li><li>Needless to say, their sushi are n't authentic, but it 's super delicious and the maki are huge.</li><li>CHEAP sushi.</li><li>FOOD QUALITY: Mediocre sushi but because it 's so cheap, it makes it taste a bit better.</li><li>Not the best cuts of sushi ( nor the freshest,), and not the best in variety but for price, it 's a decent place for a mid-week take out dinner.</li><li>Dirt cheap sushi that are large in size ?</li><li>If you are hungry and want TAKE OUT sushi only then come here.</li><li>HUGE sushi rolls, like massive pieces, good prices and AMAAAZING sushi.</li><li>I tried the yam rolls because I 'm not a fan of fish but it was probably the best sushi I 've gotten anywhere, my boyfriend got the green dragon and he really enjoyed it as well.</li><li>My sushi combo was mostly salmon, certainly reflective of the combo 's $ 10.50 price point, and most of the sushi rice fell apart as I tried to eat it.</li><li>My one piece of octopus/tako sushi was very tough.</li><li>Grabbed some takeout for dinner the other night Pros Large portions Very cheap Quick pickup Cons Was n't the best sushi I 've tried.</li><li>3/5 for taste. small place with only a couple tables. most people take out. the take out is super fast. i do n't even bother calling in advance, the takeaway is ready in a minute or two. the sushi is great and very cheap. definitely recommend, especially if you live in the area and need a quick take out meal. when i go alone i get sushi bong special which is great. if you 're not alone there are some larger portioned specials with more variety which you can share.</li><li>Have only been disappointed once, the avocado in the sushi was old and ruined the whole taste, but whatever that was the one time.</li><li>Fast and efficient sushi take out place.</li><li>Overall, a good sushi craving fix!</li><li>Pretty good sushi for a small price.</li><li>They make your sushi in less time than it takes you to pay.</li><li>Always seen pictures on instagram about sushi bong and since I was in the area ...</li><li>When people say sushi here is cheap ..</li><li>Hands down, the best sushi take-out place in the North York area.</li><li>Try the Sushi Bong Special, it 's only $ 10 and pretty delicious.</li><li>Great place when you need sushi, sashimi and roll takeout!</li><li>Overall, great place to get sushi, sashimi and rolls takeout.</li><li>The Sushi Bong Special is my favourite.</li><li>Great place for take-out or when you are craving for some great sushi.</li><li>This is the place for those sushi cravings.</li><li>The go-to cheap sushi fix.</li><li>I 've also had their sushi dinners before and they are okay but I would definitely get the rolls if you 're just looking for a quick cheap sushi fix.</li><li>Highly recommend for quick cheap sushi.</li><li>They do inexpensive sushi that 's, well, inexpensive.</li><li>If you are around the area and craving for some quick sushi, this is definitely a place to check out.</li><li>So I finally decided to venture out here on a weekday night for cheap cheap sushi.</li><li>We tried a fair share of the GTA 's Japanese restaurants and prefer to stick to sushi a la carte for portion control.</li><li>I loved the hard Rock and roll, black dragon looked really cool, and the sushi bong special was a really good deal for the amount of sushi and sashimi you could get!</li><li>I loved the hard Rock and roll, black dragon looked really cool, and the sushi bong special was a really good deal for the amount of sushi and sashimi you could get!</li><li>The sushi or sashimi is n't too special in my opinion, but I absolutely love the rolls.</li><li>Wasabi did n't have the eye watering factor and the taste of the sushi itself was very bland.</li><li>Again, I will come back as `` sushi is sushi'' for my 10yr old 's appetite and I love the fact that you really do get the bang for your buck!</li><li>Come on !!! and tax included! it tastes quite fresh too! the sushi here is soo cheap yet sooo gooood ( for the price). i ended up walking out with about 160 pieces of sushi and only paid $ 132 dollars ( including the party plastic tray which is around 10-13 dollars extra and tax) which is a VERY GOOD price compared to other sushi places. tastes are slightly above average. fresh fish and more.</li><li>Come on !!! and tax

no match making restaurant, but the sushi is fresh, as they have a huge turn over, the price is VERY fair.</li><li>A must have is the sushi bong special at 10.75 $ tax in a bit of every thing and much healthier then fast food for about the same price.</li><li>4.5 Pros: Best bang for your buck sushi Cons: Can get very busy ( Dining in not recommended) How I have not reviewed this place is beyond me.</li><li>It will never be the best, but getting pretty good sushi at an excellent price is never a bad thing.</li><li>You get 5 pieces of sushi, an 8 piece California roll and 4 pieces of salmon maki all for under $ 10.</li><li>You would expect the sushi to be some of the worst for that price point but that is not the case here.</li><li>Sushi Bong will definitely remain my go to place for cheap good sushi.</li><li>What I like about sushi bong is that they have a lot of filling but its not stuffed or surrounded by a lot of rice like some other places.</li><li>They really put an effort in presentation and putting just the right amount of everything!:) super convenient, super quick, never disappointed all around great sushi take out place !!: D.</li><li>Their sushi is fresh and their dragon rolls are amazing.</li><li>I got take out and the order was done within 20 min, i got the spider, red dynamite, sushi bong special ( 5 piece sushi with salmon and white tuna, salmon maki and California.</li><li>Good sushi for a good price.</li><li>I ordered the small sushi &amp; sashimi tray for two people and there was enough to take some home for later.</li><li>Affordable and delicious sushi.</li><li>You get your own water and tea but man the sushi is good and CHEAP !!</li><li>Really large and cheap sushi.</li><li>Beware chef makes large chunks of sushi 's so be prepared to open your mouth wide to get a piece in.</li><li>A true hole-in-the-wall sushi experience!</li><li>Sushi Bong is the opposite of those crazy fancy sushi places, but in the best way.</li><li>More like Sushi Da Bomb.</li><li>It was huge, affordable and great quality sushi.</li><li>Hence it is a go-to place for quick and cheap sushi:) Tip: Call in ahead and order, it 'll be ready when you get there.</li><li>We ordered a Sushi Bong special combo ( sushi, california, salmon maki) and the infamous house special Dynamite roll I read so much about.</li><li>Totally not being a sushi fan and not knowing good sushi from bad, I did not mind the food but even I was able to tell the difference in quality between here and other better places I have eaten recently.</li><li>However for the value I would not expect the most amazing sushi and if this place was near my house then I imagine I would continue to come here but oh well sushi bong bong that will not be the case.</li><li>Magnifico. was introduced to this place by my bro. if i need a quick sushi fix on the way downtown or coming back up ill usually stop by this place because its awesome. ive heard mixed reviews about their sashimi but i cant comment on that because ive only ever gotten rolls .. and let me tell u they do not disappoint! the rolls are huge with tons of filling as opposed to places that make rolls with tons of rice and totally gimp out on filling. they are VERY busy during weekdays so u might hve to wait ( prepare yourself). not a good place to dine in ... i would recommend take-out ( they literally have like 2 tables) Amazing rolls for a great price ( 1 spider roll and 1 dynamite roll come to just under $ 20 but thy are so big that 2 rolls fill up a box).</li><li>Wow, saw some good reviews for this place on google and decided to try it out, we normally do n't go for cheap sushi and this is exactly why.</li><li>The sushi was just awful! it was so fishy smelling we threw it away.</li><li>The most common comment about their sushi, they are huge.</li><li>The only negative about this place is that I 'm finding the sushi a little heavy on the MSG, but i still go here anyways.</li><li>I always opt for the Sushi Bong Special, which is 5 pcs Sushi, 8 pcs California Roll, and 4 pcs Salmon Maki .. for 9.50, and the size of each piece is significant.</li><li>And after one of those specials, my co-workers and I get really quiet and everyone stares at their monitors with half open eyes from being adequately filled with yummy sushi.</li><li>The sushi is quite fresh, and I 've never had any problems with it.</li><li>I ca n't say it 's the best sushi I 've have had in Toronto, but for a take out joint you get really good value.</li><li>Ok ok ok so the telephone skills in terms of customer service could use some improvement, but the sushi is fresh, fast and is served in generous portions.</li><li>Sushi is pretty big if ur hungry, I just wish they have a delivery guy to at least the buildings around them !!</li><li>A hidden gem for quality sushi, good portions for a good price.</li><li>I want sushi. &amp; I want good sushi.</li><li>To be honest though, the sushi was still better than 90% of other places so it deserves a 3 star.</li><li>With a hint of `` you 're not supposed to eat sushi when you 're sick, dumbo'' Anyways, I definitely will be sticking to the other sushi bong from now on ( unless my idiot self decides to call the wrong one again, which I can assure you, will happen) Sorry for the long and over-detailed review.</li><li>With a hint of `` you 're not supposed

it is still very tasty and given in big portions.</li><li>If you are looking for quick sushi fix and do n't want to spend $ 15 on a small california roll or a bento box, make sure you check this place out.</li><li>The sushi here is quick, fantastic and most importantly, CHEAP.</li><li>It 's no place to bring a date but it 's a nice small comfy sushi location that locals all know about.</li><li>Would love to try the dynamite roll, sushi bong special, and some of the other rolls next time!</li><li>My favourite sushi is dynamite it was one of the best sushi I had.</li><li>My favourite sushi is dynamite it was one of the best sushi I had.</li><li>The major draw back of the place is the price they make good sushi but u get 8 peaces for like 10 bucks that is what I hated about this place. you can go all you can eat sushi and pay 15 buck and go crazy.</li><li>The sushi quality was very good and the salad and miso soup were spot on!</li><li>This is now my go to for delicious sushi in the area.</li><li>Best sushi on toronto !!</li><li>The green tea ice cream is very good and it 's infinitely better than the complimentary ones you get for dessert after sushi.</li><li>Fifteen dollars for AYCE sushi, whether if I may order only once or not is unclear as it not indicated anywhere.</li><li>The salmon teriyaki was a bit dry, but the sushi was good.</li><li>I hate that they have too much rice on their sushi and roll that it actually felt like I have been ripped off.</li><li>I would still go here for a quick meal, but not for amazing sushi.</li><li>They have pretty good sushi!</li><li>We were craving sushi but were too lazy to travel to our usual restaurant.</li><li>The sushi in general had a lot of rice, and the maki rolls were poorly made.</li><li>But then again, we chose the AYCE option, we already lost our right to complain about having too much rice in our sushi and unappealing food presentation.</li><li>While you should go for the sushi, the ramen or soba noodle soups are great too.</li><li>The fish is fresh and the sushi absolutely is solidly good.</li><li>The Plus side is, if you want good tasting sushi, and you just got paid, You do n't have to drive all the way downtown, and find parking to get good sushi !!!</li><li>And for me, my choice is always sushi!</li><li>If you work in the area and want a quick sushi fix, this place is a decent option, but I would n't go out of my way to try it!</li><li>Sushi is a bit pricey but the a la carte deals are amazing and we 'll worth it.</li><li>Love going there when I have a sushi and shrimp tempura craving.</li><li>While I remember the sushi being good, the service now is terrible.</li><li>This place makes some good sushi.</li><li>They taste like ones you can probably get from a shopping mall sushi chain.</li><li>I would n't recommend this place for their rolls. convenient location, inside the emptess walk plaza, downstair from the movie theatre. the food is average and service is okay but i find it expensive compared to the quality of the food. but i understand it is due to the location. but i 'd go to other sushi place just a steeet away at sheppard where u have more choice: kiyomizu, ichiban springgarde, sakura, sushi moto, and sushi one. the price is cheaper w better quality bc of the competition.</li><li>The sushi was a little on the expensive side considering it 's a chain restaurant.</li><li>There are better places to go for a good sushi experience.</li><li>I have visited Ichiban on 2 occasions, both times I got my sushi to go so I cannot comment on the servers.</li><li>At the front they have sushi already packed to go and since i was in a rush I decided to try it.</li><li>I had the sushi and sashimi boat and it cost almost an arm and leg for it.</li><li>Their hot meals are usually good however their sushi and sashimi is lackluster.</li><li>The rice was too soft and the sushi not fresh.</li><li>Not THE best sushi I 've had, but certainly one of the best ones in North York.</li><li>There is Korean and Japanese food available at Ichiban, which is comforting if I am not in the mood for sushi I can always get Korean.</li><li>The sushi is made fresh but I felt it was n't as good as other places I have gone to, so I was n't very impressed.</li><li>I like Korean and she like sushi.</li><li>This has been the worst sushi experience of my life.</li><li>My friend is allergic to fish and they would n't let her switch her bento box sushi to a vegetarian roll.</li><li>It was appetizing and savoury, the sushi was fresh, the rice were cooked well.</li><li>I also ordered sushi here.</li><li>I ca n't say that I enjoyed the sushi here.</li><li>You definitely do not get what you pay for as there are much better places within walking distance such as sushi one or sushi moto.</li><li>If you need a sushi fix and do n't feel inclined to go elsewhere, it will do in a pinch.</li><li>On the other hand, the rice was cold and hard from the california rolls and the sushi.</li><li>Food: The sashimi and sushi here are usually fresh, albeit on the pricy side.</li><li>Much better sushi places in the area for MUCH cheaper and better customer service ( ie. sushi bong).</li><li>Pro:- fresh sushi and sashimi.</li><li>We came here with friends for a quick, late night sushi fix.</li><li>The prime rib was juicy and tender, the sushi was fresh and all of the Chinese fare was delicious. ( was n't crazy about the seaweed salad though ... ugh).</li><li>Food is okay, rice is dry, sushi is subpar.</li><li>We also ordered some apps but ended up taking the sushi to-go.</li><li>I would recommend this place for anyone in the area that is looking for decent sushi that is n't AYCE.</li><li>I usually just order the bento box, which comes with pretty decent sushi and tempura, while they do have many different options, such as Teriyaki.</li><li>My mother and I are both sushi lovers, and have been to many sushi restaurants around the city.</li><li>Good sushi and good service.</li><li>A friend took me here for dinner and we got the sushi boat D. The sushi was good, fresh and had just the right amount of rice.</li><li>Defitnely one if the best sushi places I been.</li><li>The positives: Sushi was well cut.</li><li>Customers inconsiderate and rude. the place used to be excellent. i used to come here at least once a week. now the food quality is horrendous. i ordered chicken teriyaki, it smelled like sewage and tasted spoiled. their sushi comes with fish that 's been sitting out for two days. after the last time i ate here i got a stomach ache. i understand trying to save a few bucks, but not at the expense of health!</li><li>Yuki 's is n't the best sushi out there but it 's pretty darn good if you 're looking for something in the area.</li><li>I ordered sushi &amp; sashimi bento while my friend ordered chicken teriyaki set.</li><li>The sushi and sashimi is better.</li><li>In conclusion, Yuki is good for having little bit sushi taste with cheap price.</li><li>Everyone in my party was very impressed by the quality, size and presentation of the food, especially the sushi.</li><li>Not the best sushi I 've had but it 's my go to when I 'm craving and do n't want to go downtown.</li><li>Ever since new management took over, the portion size is considerably smaller, the sushi not as fresh and the service leaves a lot to be desired.</li><li>To give you an example, I placed an order for take out today for a Sushi Maki tray, Chicken Udon and Chicken Teriaki dinner.</li><li>When I got home, the chicken was rubbery, the sushi not fresh, only 3 chopsticks when I clearly informed him we were six people, only one small container of soya sauce.</li><li>The sushi is great and the price is pretty reasonable.</li><li>This is just one of your average sushi joints, not amazing but not bad either.</li><li>The sushi here has always been somewhat sub-par with the rice being hard and they even cut down on the amount of sushi they give you per bento box!</li><li>Very cheap sushi in North York.</li><li>We were craving sushi but did n't want to settle for macsushi so drove to the closest sushi joint we can find.</li><li>The atmosphere in terms of decor and noise level like being at a mcdonalds but with sushi and servers.</li><li>Will definately pop back here when I 'm in the mood for cheap sushi.</li><li>Sashimi house is not bad as a cheap quick sushi fix but would not be the one that I will bring or recommend my friend if they want really good Japanese food!</li><li>My other friend was craving for sushi, so we decided to go to this restaurant since a) I 've never tried it; b) we were in the area; and c) my friend recommended it.</li><li>I ordered House B, and my friend had House D. The House B combo included assorted sushi ( including salmon, shrimp, and fake crab), a california roll ( 6 pcs), spicy salmon roll ( 6 pcs), and a crispy avocado hand roll.</li><li>However, the sushi quality was n't the greatest.</li><li>It 's hard to find sushi that does n't taste like Mac sushi in Scarborough, but this is awesome!</li><li>I do n't think it 's super great quality sushi, but it does the trick when you need a sushi fix!</li><li>I do n't think it 's super great quality sushi, but it does the trick when you need a sushi fix!</li><li>I like this place because not too many places offer my favourite kind of sushi ...</li><li>``Spicy-Crispy`` vegetarian ( WITH avocado) maki rolls ... mmmm! their yam tempura is yummy with its extra crispy batter ... they only have ice cream for dessert though .. their sushi might not taste a fresh as say `ten-ichi`s` but like i said, i`m won over by their SPICY CRISPY !!!!!</li><li>Try the salmon sampler ` L ' meal with salmon sashimi, sushi, salmon dynamite, and a salmon handroll for $ 7.50.</li><li>The place itself is actually pretty nice inside and there is a sushi bar ( like most places), where you can watch the guy make the sushi I ordered a krab roll with a Beef Don.</li><li>The sushi looked fresh and she really enjoyed it saying that it was a bit unexpected from a place that looked like just your standard Chinese run sushi place.</li><li>I did think that the sushi was fresher and the dish I ordered was definitely prepared much better than most places.</li><li>My bento box came with 3 pieces of California rolls, which were not done particularly well ..... all I could taste was avocado which is weird when eating sushi.</li><li>With Sushi places almost as common as finding a Starbucks, this is a restaurant that I would consider only if I happened to be in the area and want sushi ( unless you want the crap from a mall food court).</li><li>There 's only 1 other sushi place in the area so not a lot of options if I want sushi.</li><li>We love this place for cheap sushi!</li><li>It 's nothing to rave about by sushi is at par with other cheap sushi/ AYCE joints.</li><li>For the price you pay, you get great sushi and bento box options.</li><li>The sushi did take a tad of time to come and when it did, it was fresh.</li><li>I am a sucker for cheap sushi and I ca n't deny it.</li><li>I am finding that sushi is sushi in most sushi restaurants in Toronto!</li><li>I came here for lunch after discovering My Sushi was 14 dollars for lunch, and we were like screw that ( and then we went back there for dinner) but thats another story.</li><li>Even before our sushi and maki rolls made it to our table, the maki rolls were coming apart, rice was falling off of the sushi when I picked it up by hand!</li><li>Even before our sushi and maki rolls made it to our table, the maki rolls were coming apart, rice was falling off of the sushi when I picked it up by hand!</li><li>And I want to emphasize, I eat sushi with my hands because it gives me more control and holds sushi together better, but the sushi was so poorly put together, the rice was not properly made, that it fell apart as I brought to my mouth ...</li><li>And I want to emphasize, I eat sushi with my hands because it gives me more control and holds sushi together better, but the sushi was so poorly put together, the rice

the sushi was so poorly put together, the rice was not properly made, that it fell apart as I brought to my mouth ...</li><li>I decided not to complain about it again and just not eat the sushi, which was pretty disappointing.</li><li>This is the worst sushi place ever!</li><li>I would n't come here for the sushi but I remember the salmon steak being really good and actually on second thought, everything I had was really really good!</li><li>Sushi was good ( within ayce standard).</li><li>Went for AYCE sushi and did not have a pleasant experience:- Beef short ribs were n't fresh- All the rolls were falling apart- Chicken udon hardly had any chicken in it- Hand rolls were disappointing- waaay too much rice Staff decided that we ordered way too much food and kept telling us that we would n't be able to finish it.</li><li>Their sushi is passable, but not very friesh.</li><li>Sushi was good -- the fish was quite fresh.</li><li>In fact, forget the sushi, just get cooking table.</li><li>The sushi here is not that great at all.</li><li>I am a sushi lover but I never ordered sushi here, if it came with my set meal at the cooking table, then I would eat it, but I am not exactly amused by it.</li><li>2 pieces of the sushi were even spoiled- Go to Tako Sushi down the street ( Don Mills).</li><li>- Good sushi, overall the teppanyaki was pretty good, esp. the steak.</li><li>The sushi was n't fresh, the waiters showed no interest.</li><li>For $ 25 at dinner, we can have sushi, sashimi, teriyaki etc in the `` all you can eat'' option ..</li><li>The server hands you a few order sheets, and you mark down the quantity of each item desired, whether it 's sushi, appetizers, soups, noodles, hot dishes, etc., and they make everything to order.</li><li>The sushi was also good, and tasted fresh.</li><li>I go to their chicken stand and wait there for almost a good minute thinking that the person taking care of the stand is probably just cooking something up but nope no one is there ( nor is there anyone at the sushi stand beside ours) yet there are 5 employees just walking around making jokes with each other.</li><li>It 's your average sushi quality but it 's really really expensive compared to many restaurant quality sushis.</li><li>End of the day sale for when you really crave sushi and need a quick bite at the mall is okay.</li><li>The sushi here is consistently tasty.</li><li>Of the fast food sushi chains, this one and Sushi Q are consistently decent ( I abhor Bento Nouveau, as the sushi is VILE !!!)</li><li>A small, individual booth sushi place is what I had in mind.</li><li>This was proper sushi, served properly.</li><li>I give this place a solid 5 and I would recommend all sushi lovers to give it a try!</li><li>My Sushi is a really great place to go with friends and try the all you can eat sushi, the spicy mushroom tempura are my absolute favorite and the avocado covered California roll.</li><li>My Sushi is a really great place to go with friends and try the all you can eat sushi, the spicy mushroom tempura are my absolute favorite and the avocado covered California roll.</li><li>Lovely cozy place with yummy sushi.</li><li>All You Can Eat ( AYCE) sushi should never mean cutting corners.</li><li>Sushi, nigiri, rolls, cones all depend on a properly prepared rice base.</li><li>The sushi was underwhelming and on the bland side due to the rice, some of the fish were fresher than others.</li><li>The presentation of the food is nothing special either, it 's sushi on a plate and you are expected to eat it not admire it.</li><li>Anyhow, this place will not be a regular place for me, perhaps when I need AYCE sushi in a pinch but no more than that.</li><li>I do n't know how some other people thought their sushi was great.</li><li>But the execution of ths sushi was n't as great.</li><li>The all you can eat menu is not that extensive and the sushi quality is mediocre.</li><li>I tried Yang Yang 's kitchen last week and the quality of the Sushi is not comparable.</li><li>The chef for My Sushi is not a real sushi chef.</li><li>I certainly recommend this spot for a sushi fix.</li><li>My Sushi is my go-to AYCE sushi restaurant FOOD QUALITY: The sashimi is fresh for an AYCE a place and comes in good cuts.</li><li>Before my office moved downtown, we used to come here for `` all-you-can-eat'' sushi at lunch.</li><li>This sushi is good and if you 've got an appetite, the `` all-you-can-eat'' is a great option.</li><li>I came in for lunch specifically hoping for Ika ( squid) sushi, was craving it since yesterday.</li><li>The sushi had a decent amount of fish on it, but still quite a bit of rice.</li><li>Overall unless you get sushi instant craving and/or urge and it is closest to place to yours, I recommend to go other place to get better experience with the similar price.</li><li>My Sushi is a bit hidden away in a plaza located indentured beneath trees across from Buk Chang Soon Dofu.</li><li>The sushi here is pretty solid and I do n't really understand all the tough reviews.</li><li>I found them to give a pretty nice fish-rice ratio here for the sushi.</li><li>The Rainbow Rolls and the Spicy Crab Rolls were not as good as hoped, but the sushi was.</li><li>They had miso soup but seaweed salad and short ribs ( AYCE sushi favorites of mine) are only available for dinner so I was a bit disappointed.</li><li>The sushi were ok- not much selection on the menu overall.</li><li>The sushi is twisted and not good ...</li><li>The Salmon Sushi is the best of the sushi I think, the portion size to rice ratio was really good.</li><li>By far the best AYCE sushi I 've had.</li><li>They have n't messed one thing up ... well I only usually get tempura, short ribs, salmon/tuna sashimi, spicy salmon maki rolls but that 's basically the greatest parts of sushi.</li><li>It 's an ok place to go to order quick sushi.</li><li>In short for those who want decent sushi save your money and go elsewhere.</li><li>Great AYCE sushi here with you are in the area.</li><li>If I 'm in the mood for sushi but do n't feel like driving or taking transit, My Sushi is usually my Plan B. Food was fine, stuff you 'd normally expect at An AYCE sushi place.</li><li>If I 'm in the mood for sushi but do n't feel like driving or taking transit, My Sushi is usually my Plan B. Food was fine, stuff you 'd normally expect at An AYCE sushi place.</li><li>I find that the menu is smaller than the other sushi buffets that I 've been to ( Sushi Fun, Sushi Legend) and the food was just average.</li><li>I 'm a fan of AYCE sushi, although I understand you trade off quality or quantity.</li><li>I usually head downtown to Kyoto House for some reliably passable AYCE sushi.</li><li>Sushi is fresh, there 's a lot of variety and it 's reasonably priced.</li><li>Do n't get turned off by it 's dated decor and cramped space, it 's some of the best sushi I 've had.</li><li>To sum up, great tempura, good sushi.</li><li>Katsura offers some of the freshest sushi available on the east coast of north america.</li><li>It is not modern japanese cuisine ( no dragon rolls), it is really just straightup sushi and sashimi prepared by old school guys who have been tending on me since infancy.</li><li>I then ordered an eight piece sushi sampler so that I could taste the variety of everything.</li><li>- Green tea is $ 2.:/ Overall: Great sushi, but a bit overpriced.</li><li>$ 40- $ 65, salads $ 15- $ 20, sushi $ 20 + the dinner adds up quickly.</li><li>Very disappointing sushi and very expensive.</li><li>We were there to celebrate a birthday so my dad ordered various appetizers including beef sashimi ( tender and juicy, equivalent to eating beef tartare), a sushi boat ( featuring fresh spicy tuna maki, hamachi, toro, maguro, squid with salmon roe, and raw shrimp- good to order so that everyone at the table can sample different sushi and sashimi), the usual vegetables ( aka tempura), and blue tuna spicy and California hand rolls.</li><li>Sushi- probably some of the best quality sushi i have ever tried!</li><li>Sushi- probably some of the best quality sushi i have ever tried!</li><li>As I consider myself quite experienced in the sushi realm, I was incredibly dissatisfied after my current experience with Katsura.</li><li>We love sushi, so we thought we would try out this place again because our first experience was n't the best- we blamed it on them being a new business but three years later and myyy goodness.</li><li>I finally told him I would not be paying for the 6 pieces of sushi I ate because that was not worth 28.00 he took his time to argue with me ...</li><li>Summing up: extremely overpriced, indifferent service, airport hotel atmosphere and average-at-best sushi.</li><li>Sashimi and sushi are hit and miss, but when they get it right it is delicious.</li><li>If you are staying in the adjacent Westin it would n't be a bad choice but do n't expect too much and if you are alone I 'd sit away from the grill and enjoy a quiet table with sushi.</li><li>The sushi is expensive and `` so-so'', lacking any presentation beauty or real freshness.</li><li>I had the Sushi and Sashimi platter and at $ 38, I thought it lacked some creativity.</li><li>In the wasteland that is Keele &amp; Steeles, Genji Sushi is a welcome oasis of good quality food.</li><li>Good sushi, a bit pricier than some of the cheap downtown places, but this is a much more thoughtful product.</li><li>I 'm not a sushi fan so do not ask me about any of that.</li><li>If you live in North York closer to the west end and you 're looking for a place to satisfy your sushi craving then Genji is the right place to go.</li><li>I usually have to lower my expectations and settle for a sushi place that is just OKAY or DECENT just to get my sushi fix closer to home.</li><li>They make their own sauces for their sushi.</li><li>The sushi is fresh and the tempura is perfectly battered.</li><li>I believe this restaurant is good sushi place.</li><li>There is nothing else in the area if you like sushi.</li><li>Got a dragon roll and a sushi and sashimi lunch box.</li><li>Overall an average place, with decent sushi.</li><li>The sushi is very tasty and fresh.</li><li>Not high-end top 5 sushi but almost perfect.</li><li>Amazing sushi!</li><li>One of the best sushi places I 've been to in Toronto &amp; believe me, I 'm a very hard person to please when it comes to food quality.</li><li>Sushi is always fresh.</li><li>I thought it was missing the ornamental stuff that makes sushi look nice and taste good.</li><li>I will recommend this place to any poor soul who works in the area or goes to York, as it is by far the best sushi option in the area.</li><li>Great spot for pretty authentic sushi.</li><li>Great decor, solid service and superb quality sushi.</li><li>I honestly think it 's the best sushi in the GTA.</li><li>Sometimes the wait time for your order takes a bit long ( ~ 45 minutes) but I understand that it 's because everyone else wants some amazing sushi too!</li><li>Friday night dinner for 2: We did enjoy it but had some criticism of the sushi and sashimi.</li><li>This ai n't Los Angeles, why would anyone dedicate a giant floor space to sushi with so much competition ?</li><li>A good portion of the place is occupied by useless decor, like giant wall mounted sushi boats, and fake plants.</li><li>Definitely not your regular sushi experience.</li><li>Solid sushi ..</li><li>Try the salmon or tuna Tataki And they have really good speciality rolls The only thing I can complain about is the alcohol choices .. besides fancy girl drinks the beer selection is not too good The sushi is on par with any place I 've tried I would consider this place average to above average ..</li><li>Tako Sushi, at first when I heard about the place I thought it was Mexican/Asian/fusion that served sushi and tacos LOL but then when I saw the name of the restaurant, realized it was just Japanese.</li><li>I should have probably read the reviews on yelp before going to the restaurant .. but I did n't .. .. btw before i get started why is there filtered reviews ? maybe i missed something ..; anyways went here for lunch with a co-worker because its close to the office .. the decor is okay and we were quickly seated but thats as good as it got .. none of the staff make eye contact, everything is slow even tho the establishment was n't busy, there was just no importance on quality .. we ordered one of the lunch specials, the pricing is good, but I learned a long time ago, you get what you pay for, so for $ 7 to $ 15 you can get a salad, appetizer, sushi, chicken/beef, dessert, etc the food was cold and really average, they forgot our sushi and when we pointed it out to the manager he said he would take it off our bill .. a whole $ 1.20 ?? for 6 sushi rolls .. like i said u get what u pay for .. my co-worker, who is from hong kong blasted the manager, but he was no help ... so i will never go back .. but the experience got me back to using yelp!;).</li><li>I have n't necessarily explored their sushi options and am not too excited to try it either.</li><li>Oh by the way the sushi was probable from 2 days ago, and just kept in the fridge ..</li><li>We ordered a spicy seafood soup ( very spicy), fried calamari, sweet potato tempura, sushi &amp; sashimi dinner combo, and a green dragon roll which all together cost $ 48, so not bad.</li><li>Fresh but the sushi was poorly executed.</li><li>Their dine-in menu includes appetizers, sushi &amp; sashimi, special rolls, live lobster, BBQ beef short ribs, curry, cutlets, grilled salmon, set course meals, teppanyaki dishes and so much more.</li><li>EFFECTIVE MONDAY FEBRUARY 24th, TAKO SUSHI IS CLOSED INDEFINITELY.</li><li>Saikyo Style Baked Scallop Pan Fried Mixed Mushroom Food is overall pretty good, sushi and sashimi wise, nothing too special but for what you get and the price is pretty good.</li><li>I like their sushi &amp; sashimi diamond combinations.</li><li>The sushi is so good, and bento boxes are just delicious.</li><li>It just so happens that their specialty is sushi.</li><li>And the quality rivals the most notorious sushi restaurants in the downtown core.</li><li>On a positive note, the sushi was fairly fresh.</li><li>Sushi is ok ... most of the items were pretty bland and uninteresting.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
