( In a very old plaza) There was only one waiter when I went and he was very friendly:) .. but it was a bit difficult speaking to him because of his thick Persian accent Overall I was satisfied with Alboraz, I will definitely come back when I get the chance.</li><li>I was served by a nice waiter at that time though.</li><li>I do n't know what changed, but to top it off, our waiter, who was nice, perhaps could use some deodorant.</li><li>Our waiter was incredibly friendly.</li><li>The waiter was n't up to speed cause he forgot our drink a couple times with us reminding him.</li><li>As a waiter I know this is rude to the customer and this is something I absolutely hate and so do a lot of my friends, whom have n't been waiters at all in their lives.</li><li>The service is not consistently great .. every once in a while you get a waiter whose too busy for you ..</li><li>The waiter was prompt and friendly.</li><li>----- Service: Mediocre ------ Louise was n't as helpful as expected- food came out real slow for a casual-family restaurant- limited water refills ( Almost felt like we were experiencing a water famine)- male waiter tossed a fork at us ( Sorry, did n't know we were disturbing your blooming juggling career.) ----- Atmosphere: Mediocre ------ very warm ( Do n't get me wrong, there were indivudal AC units in every room, but they did n't bother turning it on, probably because they were huge eco supporters.</li><li>The Service: Pretty good service- there was only one waiter running around making our drinks and taking our order, at the same time running over to the next door bar to serve people there.</li><li>The waiter was hilarious and good-naturedly poked fun at me when I could n't decide.</li><li>The waiter apologized profusely for it and my roommate was n't too upset about it as the majority of the dish was edible and very tasty!</li><li>Went to pay with my AX card and the waiter keeps asking me if it 's a debit or a credit ?</li><li>For instance, last night our waiter asked my brother if he wanted extra mushrooms on his pizza.</li><li>We 'll definitely be back, and hopefully get the same waiter who kept us chuckling all night too.</li><li>On my first visit, I 'd asked the waiter to tweek one of the linguine pesto without the pollo ( i.e. chicken).</li><li>Not unless you do n't mind how your waiter treats you and only come for fast service and good food.</li><li>The waiter was hovering at times, but it looked like he was just trying to make sure we did n't have to wait to ask for anything.</li><li>Nowhere have I experienced better service from not just our waiter but each and every member of the staff.</li><li>We were very excited once the waiter bought the gejang to our table.</li><li>I came here twice thunjing maybe the first time was just a bad day for the waiter but i was wrong.</li><li>Our waiter was also very attentive and he did an excellent job.</li><li>Both him and our waiter were extremely rude and basically victim blamed.</li><li>A different waiter than the one who originally served us since we outlasted her shift, looked at me in the eye and came over to ask me how we were doing.</li><li>A Chinese waiter once told us that every Chinese restaurant has a `` Special'' Fried Rice, and China Gourmet is no different.</li><li>With the assistance from the waiter, I opted for the chicken box.</li><li>The waiter suggested they cooked the BBQ for us.</li><li>But the price is kind of fair. ok food but bad service. the waiter never talk to u or answer u when u talk to him. the food is average and i 'd rather visit otjer places to eat pho.</li><li>She saw a waiter accidentally spill sauce on my clothes and just rolled her eyes.</li><li>I asked the waiter if I could order a whole cheesecake for next time, but she told me that the cheesecake was ordered from a supplier.</li><li>The waiter asked what we wanted to drink and when we told him water, he then told us the coupon wo n't work unless we both order drinks.</li><li>During our meal 10 other patrons arrived ( 2 were children) Only one waiter, and one chef, tending the large pizza oven.</li><li>The food was worth one star but I 'm throwing in an extra star because our waiter was nice.</li><li>The waiter never came to check if we still had any water, I asked once and the second time my fiance just went to grab the water for me.</li><li>The waiter also told us he was looking for the dessert menu and after like 10 mins, he said he finally found one.</li><li>Our waiter was absolutely outstanding.</li><li>The waiter who served us was nice, low-key and provided impeccable, professional service.</li><li>Our waiter was friendly and punctual.</li><li>Our entrees did not come out with steak knives like some places have it so we had to flag down another waiter after sitting and staring at our food for several minutes.</li><li>The service was slow, but this was due to it being very busy ( not the waiter 's fault), but when the food finally came, it was good.</li><li>The waiter finally got around to getting our orders, only to rush us into making decisions.</li><li>Which is where the waiter got a Caesar salad for my friend who only ordered that for dinner.</li><li>For the second half of the meal the waiter was inconsistent with filling our water glasses.</li><li>The service was so so- I barely saw my waiter to begin with.</li><li>The waiter was very nice and the food was very similar unlike the scarborough location.</li><li>The waiter even said we could sit there after they closed if we walked out via the patio.</li><li>One waiter brought me a secret stash of hot sauce for my ribs!</li><li>Our waiter ( I ca n't remember his name!) was so nice.</li><li>The waiter was average because I could not find him for a refill or steak sauce.</li><li>Nachos with spinach dip were stale, waiter tried to tell us they were fine.</li><li>Wonderfully friendly waiter.</li><li>Our waiter forgot to bring my take out order even though I asked him twice for it, once at the time we ordered our take ins and second time while we were eating.</li><li>He ( waiter) came to us later asking me if I am sure about the take out order and if I in fact ordered it at all!</li><li>The waiter always brings complimentary noodle soup, and finishes the meal with a cold cinnamon ginger tea for digestion.</li><li>The waitress that was supposed to bring the rest of our order took our receipt and never returned so we had to ask another waiter.</li><li>Even the brandy and caramelized onion sauce is light and not overpowering Service is excellent especially from our waiter who is patient and knowledgeable.</li><li>You have to order at a counter, a waiter does n't take your order.</li><li>If I had known that going in, then I would have sat there like an idiot waiting for the waiter to take our order.</li><li>Pros Great Dessert Good food Not really any service Cons Meat came after the salad Looked stupid waiting for the waiter to take our order ... will look cool next time i guess.</li><li>After talking with the waiter, he offered to switch her plate with something else.</li><li>When we 're finally seated, the waiter tells me he will clean the table for us.</li><li>You are seated, get fancy menus, see the appealing open concept kitchen, so of course expect a waiter to take the order.</li><li>We finally placed our order to a clearly harried and very gruff waiter, who appeared to be the manager.</li><li>Half an hour later when the tables around us who had ordered after us received their starters, we flagged down the waiter to ask where ours were and he seemed surprised that we even asked and said, `` I did n't forget about you, you know.''</li><li>I think it 's more efficient than telling the waiter your order.</li><li>After taking about 5 bites all together out of both plates the waiter demanded to pay when i got up and told them there was insects there again.</li><li>The waiter was friendly, brought us an ordered bottle of wine, poured the first time and after that we had to do it ourselves.</li><li>Then we told this to our waiter, he apologized and that was it.</li><li>The waiter ( a new one) while confirming the order said `` eXpresso''!</li><li>My side plate from our appetizers was sitting in front of me and the waiter made no move to move my plate for my entree.</li><li>It took a long time to get the bill and the waiter practically grunted at me to move over so he could clear my plate.</li><li>The waiter instantly apologized and had it cooked to my liking.</li><li>The waiter was very prompt and gave us good tips on choosing food and drinks.</li><li>Our waiter was good, but i never got his name and I think he was the only one on shift.</li><li>Give this place a shot and I hope for the poor guy they hired another waiter or waitress: S.</li><li>Unfortunately service was perfunctory and getting the waiter 's attention required constant struggle.</li><li>We called the waiter over and asked if maybe we can order something else in it 's stead.</li><li>The waiter is a old lady that looked like a mom with an apron.</li><li>Friendly waiter.</li><li>Later the waiter came back and told me the one I previouslly ordered was n't included because it was ' bigger' ... lol. no joke, the mug probably had 1 tablespoon more milk tea then the one included in the meal.</li><li>It was n't until we left that I realized we had passed their closing time but the waiter had n't rushed us at all.</li><li>The subway regularly runs by below, the overhead lights are cranked to an unflattering brightness, and you get to listen to your waiter taking constant phone calls ordering takeout.</li><li>The waiter asked whether I was with that gentleman, I said no, and then proceeded to sit down at a table.</li><li>The waiter then told me: `` Do n't sit, wait here please'' at the cashier.</li><li>The waiter just asked me 5 minutes ago whether I was with that gentleman that was seated at a table by himself, which means clearly he was allowed to sit and wait for his party.</li><li>The waiter, who 's also the part owner and son of the cook, is a little weird- but he 's actually a very nice guy- even though he may not seem like that at first brush.</li><li>I do n't understand why everyone seems to be giving the waiter ( there 's only one waiter who works there) a hard time.</li><li>I do n't understand why everyone seems to be giving the waiter ( there 's only one waiter who works there) a hard time.</li><li>The seating inside is plentiful, the atmosphere is nice, and our waiter was just lovely ( he was very friendly and his service stood out), but as I consider food to be the star of the show, I wo n't be hurrying back here any time soon, though I wo n't say I 'd never try it again.</li><li>I would go again. i 've my 2nd visit and i was not disappointment! ... i had the salmon on the 1st visit a nd ordered it again. the service was spectacular ... and that 's the reason why Mike our waiter should be employee of the month !!!</li><li>The service was okay, and I 'm not going to knock the waiter who was fairly new to the job, but we would not recommend this place.</li><li>The ambiance was really good and the waiter was good at suggesting us dishes.</li><li>Not a welcoming atmosphere our waiter was not helpful at all.</li><li>The nice waiter said they were both home made and he likes Tiramisu better ...</li><li>The waiter was quick with our drinks and food and was helpful with suggestions.</li><li>We were told they had the 3rd best lasagna in the city and the waiter recommended the Parmesan Chicken.</li><li>Our waiter was super friendly and he even got us an extra bread basket when we asked for it at no extra charge.</li><li>My waiter seemed to rush a bit even though it was a Wednesday night and there was no line up.</li><li>Only 1thing about this place, waiter showed us to our tables, did not introduce himself.</li><li>When I notified the waiter of this, three staff came out apologizing to me as if it were some international incident between China and Italy.</li><li>I was busy telling another waiter that it was okay that the orders of which the food came did n't offend me.</li><li>We were quickly seated near the entrance, and our waiter named the specials for the day ( none of which were pasta).</li><li>We ordered fairly quickly and let our waiter know that we were trying to catch a movie by 9:50PM.</li><li>We bring this to the attention of our waiter, who offered to give us back $ 5 which was the difference of the two bills.</li><li>According to the waiter, this dessert was made in the restaurant ( unlike the cheesecake that was the other choice ... from Cheescake Factory).</li><li>Our waiter was friendly and very helpful.</li><li>There is a time the waiter did not give me the dessert menu and he told me that he will tell me what they have.</li><li>2) Dan was a fantastic waiter!</li><li>The service can go either way- we went here for my birthday and my brother double checked with the waiter that the spring rolls did n't contain any peanuts.</li><li>The waiter recommended the golden curry but it was nothing special and certainly was n't a big enough portion to be worth $ 14.</li><li>And then the waiter would shred the duck for you so you can put the shredded pieces in a steamed rice wrapper ( like peking duck).</li><li>I will say our waiter was very cordial and made up for our greeting but I probably wo n't come again.</li><li>Our waiter was nice too, a little overcompensating on the `` trying to be funny'' but nevertheless friendly.</li><li>When I told the waiter, he said that it was the correct change for what I gave him.</li><li>We only had an hour for lunch and had to leave sooner than we liked and told the waiter this and asked for the entree and dessert together.</li><li>The waiter then said the chefs are putting all other orders on hold and cooking ours first.</li><li>We came here for dinner and was greeted by a very friendly waiter:) From first glance, the decor had a really traditional Thai feel but still lived up to the modern in its name.</li><li>But the waiter realized that we might not enjoy it, so he promptly took it back, free of charge!</li><li>I can at least say that the service was good, food came quick and we never had to wait to give the waiter our menu selections.</li><li>The food is like any other all you can east sushi place it 's clean and small, the waiter is very rude and blunt he sneezed into his hand 3 times right on the floor !!</li><li>The service was ok; the waiter was friendly but a little slow at times.</li><li>We had to ask twice to get our second garlic bread; the waiter sure looked like he had forgotten about it -- he did not apologize about the delay.</li><li>When we asked for the butter for the second time, he ( the same waiter) mumbled something about there 's not enough for every table as he was walking away.</li><li>I asked the waiter if it 's supposed to be like that and he could n't explain.</li><li>Seems like the young waiter that was in the old place is now a manager here.</li><li>The waiter pushed our table so it no longer hit our table but it was too late because it touched our food.</li><li>Sometimes it is a drag to have to get your waiter 's attention for stuff ... like constantly, but, you really come here for the food.</li><li>I 'm not sure if it was our waiter but the food took forever.</li><li>We ordered things and only 2 came out, waited for 15 minutes after we finished the rest of our food and it still did not come so we had to ask the waiter again to see if our food was done.</li><li>After telling what had happened to another waiter whom which we asked the bill for, he seemed pissed off that we were n't waiting for the food.</li><li>Got our order wrong ( The waiter even confirmed with us before placing the order.</li><li>This guy ( not our waiter) did n't even apologize.</li><li>We asked the waiter if this is the right order.</li><li>The waiter advised that it would take 20 mins for it to come out, which was fine by me.</li><li>When I asked the waiter to look into the status ... they came back with a `` this dish normally takes 30 mins so it should be done now.''</li><li>As usual, I ordered this except this time the waiter told me in half-understandable English that I can only order one noodle, even if I want to pay extra for it.</li><li>Why could n't the waiter just serve both our tables the appetizers ?!</li><li>The waiter was very nice, and I went out with three others and we had the mein for app and then 3 portions of the daegalbee which was enough!</li><li>Since the place is small, the waiter was able to constantly check up on us.</li><li>`` YOU GOT TO KNOW HOW TO ORDER'', the waiter whispered.</li><li>One time the waiter took down our number and promised to call us when they had a table available.</li><li>We said we saw your waiter taking down our number.</li><li>Later on, they found our number from the garbage bin, because their waiter threw it there.</li><li>A waiter had knocked over one of the soup dishes and then just threw napkins on the table ...</li><li>We tried desperately to catch the attention of our waiter who just seemed to ignore us.</li><li>Neither did our waiter.</li><li>Our waiter was friendly and checked in on us a couple of times and refilled our water and tea.</li><li>Paying the bill is such a hassle too, I wait forever for the one waiter to finally show face, and waiting him to bring back a credit card machine is another story.</li><li>The service was slow and my waiter was rushed.</li><li>Waiter was nice and responsive, but needed to be more attentive to what is order and what makes it too the plate.</li><li>Pickle Barrel need to concentrate on customer orders and getting it right, We go regularly and it is getting stupid how many time we need to call back waiter to get correct orders.</li><li>We had a very friendly young waiter, who was very glad to serve us, he suggested the Kong Po stir-fry and it did n't disappoint.</li><li>The waiter was also on top of bringing us refills of pop, before we ran out there was a fresh glass waiting for us to drink!</li><li>However it all depends on who you waiter is it seems with this location ....</li><li>Our waiter eventually brought it to us but it seemed like he was super busy so I do n't really blame him.</li><li>The waiter practically threw our food at us.</li><li>Our waiter had the worst greasy comb over ever!</li><li>Our waiter is obviously a little scatterbrained.</li><li>Was served tea, new plates provided during meal, there was a slight wait for the peking duck but that was to be expected but the waiter also did advise that there will be a wait, so no big complaints.</li><li>Check it out and say hello to Joe the waiter.</li><li>When the waiter finally came to our call, he could not hide the evident and obvious portion issue.</li><li>The Lazy Susan on the table does not work and the waiter has his trick to make it move again very smoothly.</li><li>Once we got seated, she asked the waiter if we could get chrysanthemum tea.</li><li>Except for a short hair waiter with glasses brought us everything we wanted ... 5 minutes late.</li><li>Order taker very nice, waiter seemed to have a bit of an attitude.</li><li>My friend asked for a refill of side dishes, but the waiter said they can only refill 3 types for the entire meal even though competing nearby Korean restaurants refill all of them.</li><li>The experience continued when we were paying and waiter was complaining that we did n't give them 15% tips, so I added some more for tips.</li><li>The service was good the people were friendly and talkative and this waiter gave us opinion on which cake to get since we were torn between the pistachio cheesecake and the pistachio buttercream.</li><li>At my second visit, the waiter was very sweet and provided great service but he charged us for spring rolls we did not order.</li><li>2) My brother left his wallet on the table for literally 3mins, when he came back it was gone ... and the waiter said he had n't seen it.</li><li>The waiter said nothing to me.</li><li>I only give this place a 2 star, since another waiter helped me teach how to get the meat out of the lobster leg.</li><li>We asked the waiter about the music and he said it was the sushi makers mix, killed the mood.</li><li>Maybe different waiter i dont know.</li><li>I said to the waiter ( who may have been the owner/manager, I 'm not sure) that I was intrigued, and he said if I loved savoury/sweet combinations I would like it.</li><li>I came here Friday night around 530pm and was greeted and seated immediately by the waiter.</li><li>By the way, if you ever wonder why the waiter pour water in the rice stone after transferring the rice in the bowl, here 's the reason: like most non-korean people, we would think that they pour the water to easily clean the stone, but in fact, you should be eating it.</li><li>The waiter was very rude and just ask what you want and then throw the plates at you.</li><li>I found the service to be spotty on this night and it was difficult to flag down a waiter at times.</li><li>The waitress brought it over, placed it on our table, then we heard a lady screaming at the waiter in Korean jibbersish.</li><li>The waiter then took our appetizer away after placing it on table.</li><li>The pot was sizzling when the waiter brought it and the rice was purple.</li><li>I knew things were going bad when the waiter started moving our table without saying a word.</li><li>I was resting my arm on the table when out of no where the waiter starts pulling my table away.</li><li>Things got worse when another waiter started clearing another table and instead of putting the other table 's things on a cart, he proceeded to put another table 's bottles and cups on our table!</li><li>Just make sure you let the waiter know you parked back there once you get seated inside.</li><li>When the waiter takes your order, they always ask for your licence plate in case you need to move your car in the middle of your meal.</li><li>The waiter was a bit rushed, but he was n't rude- I 'd say he was quite efficient in doing his job.</li><li>We sit down- and usually this is when a waiter notices and brings us utensils and napkins- but we get NO service until we ask them and they only bring us napkins ... okay no biggie.</li><li>We were there for an hour and in that hour we got interrupted by the waiter and manager 16 times.</li><li>I could n't get a sentence in or to talk about work with out getting bombarded by the waiter.</li><li>The waiter was charged me for the extra sauce.</li><li>There is a bell parked beside the table to call the waiter, although I did n't need to use it that day.</li><li>I still ate it however i did add a lot of salt in the soup so that helped somewhat. the service i would give a 2.5/5 because the employees do n't respond to you, even if you wave down a waiter they 'll just ignore you. i did find my bf 's bulgogi dish appetizing, along with the kimchi. although my gom tang was n't as expected, i will probably be back here on a random night craving for some korean food. i am pretty sure there are better dishes they have to offer. pretty convenient that there 's a private parking lot. ( that 's a plus for me bc we hate looking for parking and paying the ticket in general).</li><li>Upon entering, the waiter already knew to get a pitcher of water to guess us started and appetizers came fairly quick, considering the amount of business they had.</li><li>The service is always excellent and fast, especially if we get the waiter called Yin Tung.</li><li>On the downside, at our last visit, we had a waiter by the name of Collin who slammed the dishes down on the table after we told him we just needed takeout boxes so we can pack up the extra food home ourselves.</li><li>The nice waiter came immediately to apologize for Collin 's behaviour.</li><li>So we asked the waiter to look at it, he said `` its like that!''.</li><li>The waiter even said, look at the dumplings, they all like this.</li><li>Table was too small for all the food ordered and waiter struggled to organize.</li><li>My only problem was with the waiter who was a slim nerdy looking guy with glasses.</li><li>The waiter we had was super friendly and it made eating there a nicer experience.</li><li>The waiter skipped by and said the kitchen was busy.</li><li>Every waiter, and I mean it, every one of them is rude and made me and my friends felt really unwelcomed; like we were there to eat free food instead of paying for them.</li><li>The waiter that served us would just dump the food on the table without saying a word and had a bad attitude the whole time.</li><li>And I like their button which I can press and a waiter shows up.</li><li>They have call bells at the tables so you do n't have to struggle to get your waiter 's attention.</li><li>We had ordered- 4 skewers that our waiter suggested, the taadig appetizer, 2 vegeterian appetizers ( olives, and a yogurt blend- both terrific!), 2 glasses of house wine and a beer.</li><li>For the 4 `` skewers'' /kebobs, it actually was charged as 3 full dinner sized meals, which the waiter did n't make clear.</li><li>My recommendation is if you go, do not take suggestions from the waiter but order specifically off the menu as to have a clear understanding- and expectation- of what you 're getting.</li><li>Unfortunately was served by the rudest waiter in my life who thought an attire and a misplaced pride can account for a lack of discipline, manners, or even language knowledge.</li><li>The service was good and fast and the waiter was friendly.</li><li>The waiter was a polite young guy.</li><li>Our waiter also did n't seem too pleased that neither one of us were going to have any wine.</li><li>The waiter is kind enough to exchange it with Tilapia.</li><li>I informed the waiter, who seemed confused and went to ask the owner, who came to us and assured us it was still on.</li><li>At this point the owner, not the waiter), came and recited the specials for us.</li><li>The waiter never asked us if we needed anything and only looked annoyed when we did ask.</li><li>Food took forever to come .. my friend had to ask one of the waitresses if the food on the ledge was ours because it was sitting there for 10 min. The waiter was confused about our bill and had to reprint it 3 times.</li><li>They only had one waiter so we would always steal the menu from the other tables in order to get some extra servings.</li><li>Though the waiter spilt the teapot water in front of friend, did n't get mad.</li><li>He appologized and all was Forgiven.:) Con: In the beginning after 10 mins the waiter wrote down what we order, came back twice to tell us 2 of the items were sold out.</li><li>Finally a waiter came and said they had trouble with the ordering machine.</li><li>To begin with our waiter kept us waiting for more than 15 minutes just to take the order.</li><li>We called the waiter to explain all the situation and then the manager came and apologized for the whole situation.</li><li>The first thing I noticed was that there seemed to be only one waiter serving the entire restaurant.</li><li>Once my entire group arrived, that waiter came by our table to apologize for the slow service.</li><li>My waiter was nice enough to cover the lattes as a free coffee!</li><li>The food was delicious and our waiter was great.</li><li>When we sent their `` freshly squeezed juice'' back the waiter claimed it was from yesterday .after sending that back my niece ordered a mango juice ( blended with ice extra charge) and guess what it was n't sweet soooo we sent that back for a mango juice without ice the last one was fine.on the bill they charged us for the mango juice we sent back which was more expensive.</li><li>In the case of the latter, our waitress was pulled away from us due to another situation and a nearby waiter was assigned to my table, and he was instantly all charm.</li><li>The waiter did n't even bother greeting us, two of the girls stayed at the bar until 10 Mins after ( menu was already on the table).</li><li>And here 's the best part -- as we were getting up to leave, the only English speaking waiter came over to ask us how was our meal was.</li><li>It should be very easy to spot a waiter but instead most of the times, they are behind the counter and in the kitchen.</li><li>But if you 're non-Asian and reading this and saying, `` Oh my goodness, how racist or prejudice of them'', definitely ask for the Chinese menu and get a waiter to translate it and see what you 'll fancy.</li><li>He just would n't clear our plates ... so I do n't know if there 's a Chinese thing where you 're not supposed to clear plates until the end ... in any case, I asked my mom and she said that it 's nonsense and that the waiter should just clear everyone 's damn plates.</li><li>The service was COLD and rude as the waiter just barges in to drop our food off without a smile or a word.</li><li>We waited for about 5 minutes before flagging down a waiter and asking what is the deal on the final order.</li><li>I saw a waiter cleaning the table and asked for soya sauce ...</li><li>We had to leave it to the next table and walk it over to the waiter that was cleaning other tables ...</li><li>One i sat behind 4 drunk guys at 1130am and the waiter just went along with it.</li><li>My fork had a very sticky mush on the back that was not cleaned off right unfortunately I did not notice it till I was done eating when I flipped around my fork and I know it was not from my food because it was not any type of food it turned me right off my table was sticky and my waiter was not very welcoming and seemed like she did not care and she would continue talking to her friends and yeilling out sit anywhere when someone walked in when I was finished eating I was waiting for her for about 15 min before she actually stopped talking to friends and came over and asked if I was finished and if I would like anything else the food was slapped together I understand its a 24 hour wimpys and you have to serve and make a lot of food in a fast paste time but it could of been neater and cooked a bit more.</li><li>I had what the waiter said was a `` 12 oz'' NY striploin.</li><li>As another couple of the group confirmed my above impression and did note this to the waiter we were offered a second chance.</li><li>The waiter was polite but seemed prone to mixing up the sides with the various orders ( our group was 10 people, and he did write them down) which necessitated some last minute fiddling on his part during main course presentation.</li><li>When she confronted the waiter about the undercooked steak, he asked `` Do you want it cooked some more ?''.</li><li>The waiter and I had a fairly lengthy discussion of whether I wanted the 10-year-old ( $ 11) port or the 20-year-old ( $ 16) port. I chose the 20-year.</li><li>When asked, `` How is everything ?'' by the waiter, one of the ladies at our table said `` Not very good''.</li><li>The waiter seemed to ignore her, and just walked away.</li><li>We had to individually go through the bill with the waiter, itemizing everything that each of us had.</li><li>A waiter brings out a cart and sears the meat right by your table, it 's fun to watch!</li><li>The waiter was professional and the service was top notch!</li><li>Finally our waiter pulled the flambé station over and cooked the peppercorn sauce.</li><li>The waiter gave us the bill and put all out orders together.</li><li>We asked him he could split it numerous times but the waiter refused and said that we should of told him earlier.</li><li>The waiter should of split the bill for us.</li><li>After paying the man we calculated the bill and found that the waiter had scammed us.</li><li>Our waiter knew us before and acknowledged us, but another Waiter forgot our coffees and charged us for it.</li><li>The waiter liked to fill them up almost to the top with our bottle of Chianti Classico- I guess he did n't want to come by and fill them up too often.</li><li>Definitely a miss. I had the prime rib- I asked for it medium rare and in my eyes it was done medium but the waiter insisted it was medium rare.</li><li>I asked for pepper on the table but the waiter said he does n't have and to just let him know when- then he violently cracked a whole heap on the side of my plate ...</li><li>It 's unfortunate that the one thing that sticks in my mind from my 6 person team lunch is the older waiter arguing with my co-worker over whether or not her Filet Mignon was cooked to medium rare or not.</li><li>New owners apparently and it is evident, will not be returning after horrid experience Medium well filet came medium rare, took 30 mins to get waiter to cook some more and than half came well done other half still medium rare Presentation was better but food quality, cooking and service down a notch, previously my favourite restaurant but I will never return Thanks for the memories old owners.</li><li>Fair enough, the waiter warned me it would be, but this was kind of gross.</li><li>The service was great, waiter was very attentive and there was complimentary coat check.</li><li>After we finished our bottle of wine, the waiter did n't even come to see if we wanted anything else to drink &amp; our waters were not even topped up once, usually we do n't even have to ask because they would just come around to do it.</li><li>We had to flag down our waiter to place an order for our appetizer and when we placed our food order, it came and the meat was cooked just right &amp; the sides were obviously counted ....</li><li>I asked the waiter, why has this place changed so much ?</li><li>We did not see a waiter through the evening unless I had to flag him down because usually there are waiters every few minutes to come by and top of your water or freshen up your appetizer tray &amp; pour your wine.</li><li>The drinks waiter had never heard of a common aperitif.</li><li>The waiter hectored us as we ordered, rudely corrected a request for rack of lamb to be done pink, said we meant medium, and lectured us on all of his preferred definitions.</li><li>A waiter had knocked over an empty glass on his tray ( for sharing).</li><li>When it came a waiter said that as well as coffee, all of our `` aperitifs'' were on the house.</li><li>Near the end of the meal we had to go look for our own milk and brown sugar because our waiter was nowhere to be found.</li><li>Than after i payed I did n't want to even think of tipping anyone so just as were about to leave the waiter stops us and asks for a tip.</li><li>Firstly the waiter brought back $ 25, one $ 20, one $ 5.</li><li>I asked the waiter to split the $ 20 into four $ 5 bills, and the waiter obviously thought it some kind of hassle and swore in Korean.</li><li>I asked the waiter to split the $ 20 into four $ 5 bills, and the waiter obviously thought it some kind of hassle and swore in Korean.</li><li>The waiter that took our order did n't write anything down ( maybe English was n't so good so he did n't understand us) so we had to tell him again.</li><li>On July 3, 2014 around 9:10 pm, me and my girl friend went to this restaurant, we sit at the table in front of entrance, my girlfriend ask the waiter tea.
