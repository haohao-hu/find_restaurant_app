<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 22' %><h2>fish<br />occurrence: 365</h2><div><ol><li>It was a tepid, humid temperature, which is never good for a restaurant that handles raw fish.</li><li>The fish was pretty fresh.</li><li>The service has always been great and the fish is so fresh.</li><li>Main- Maki set- Avocado, Salmon, and Tuna roll ( I think around 18 pieces which was a pretty decent price, however, they were tasteless, cheap fish for sure).</li><li>The batter on the fish was a bit on the greasy side, but was a nice consistency- not too crispy but not too soft.</li><li>The fish was tender, soft, and flavourful.</li><li>I really enjoyed the food and we were given gigantic servings of fish.</li><li>The batter on the fish is a tad bit thicker than most other fish and chips joints, but I did n't mind.</li><li>Show they just dont want you to eat the fish.</li><li>3 of their salmon sashimi = 1 salmon sashimi anywhere else. all the fish were so thin it looked like oil soaked through a piece of paper. the whole meal is smaller than the size of my fist ... and over half of it was white radish used to fill and prop up the transparent fish. after you calculate everything .. you totally lose.</li><li>But the chirashi don was not satisfying because the fish does not taste fresh.</li><li>The ventilation could definitely be better as there is a not too pleasant fish smell throughout the store!</li><li>You choose the fish and they will take the scales off for you on the spot if you so desire.</li><li>Lots of frozen fish and some frozen veggies available all at competitive prices.</li><li>The fish is fresh and high quality ....</li><li>I 've been severely ill for the last two weeks, whatever I ate it was sure to be regurgitated back up ... so why I picked fish I do n't know.</li><li>Always friendly staff, and fresh fish.</li><li>Service is great, fish is fresh, drinks are cold, booths are intimate.</li><li>The fish was absolutely perfect -- it tasted like it may have been swimming several hours back:) The service was excellent- the server volunteered to change the existing roll components to what he inferred we would like- which is unusual to say the least.</li><li>I ordered the assorted sashimi boat, expecting a lot of cheap fish, but it wasnt too bad!</li><li>I agree that Sushi Moto is pricier than other Sushi places in the area, but their fish is also the freshest!</li><li>He had even less variety of fish and paid an extra dollar.</li><li>And this had a good variety of fish: 6 pieces of salmon sashimi, 3 pieces of tuna, 3 pieces of red snapper, 3 pieces of yellow tail, 3 pieces of torched butter fish, and 3 pieces of this one I ca n't remember ( If anyone can identify it from the pic, please let me know!).</li><li>The rest of the fish were really fresh.</li><li>When I took a look at the second piece of sushi and then turned it over as I dipped the piece into some soy sauce, I realized it was actually TWO layers of fish.</li><li>Got the sushi/sashimi combo and for $ 50 + ( tax tips not included) all we got were very ordinary pieces of rolls and fish.</li><li>The fish tasted hard and frozen and the rolls were okay, ayce quality.</li><li>All the food here is good- tempura is well fried, chicken tasted like organic ( not sure it is, but it was so good!), and all the fish tasted so fresh and satisfying.</li><li>The fish was not fresh and the crunch was soggy ( why even include crunch if you are just going to premake these rolls hours ago, the crunch just makes it taste greasy and adds a bunch of calories).</li><li>Sushi is supposed to be consumed as soon as it is prepared, and the fact that they allow raw fish to sit in room temperture for so long just shows how little they care about their food and their customers.</li><li>You can taste the freshness on the fish.</li><li>The only raw fish I eat is ...</li><li>Then again nothing beats the raw fish I eat once in while.</li><li>The sashimi and sushi combo sets offer a wide selection of fresh fish and the presentation speaks for itself in these photos.</li><li>Their sashimi small- one of the best values ever- generous portion and various, high end cut fish!</li><li>The other problem was the rice/fish ratio was too much on the rice side, that is, there was too much rice and too little fish.</li><li>Sushi Moto is definitely pricier than the plenty of other sushi restaurants in the area, but the quality of fish is hands down the best and worth the money.</li><li>The fish were high quality and fresh, the rice was a good portion relative to the size of fish, and the maki were well made and delicious.</li><li>Again, the fish were high quality and fresh, the nigri sushi was well made and well portioned, and every bite was delicious.</li><li>The rolls were delicious and they give you a good variety of fish and rolls.</li><li>However, you just get common fish, a cali roll and a spicy salmon roll which was definitely not worth the whopping $ 70 after tax and tips.</li><li>Every time I come to Moto sushi I always get great service, fish is fresh and atmosphere is really cool.</li><li>Good fresh fish, larger than average portions for the money and large menu with classic and interesting interpretations of the range of sushi offerings.</li><li>All the fish was fresh and they had a very nice assortment.</li><li>I think it is best to stick to sashimi or nigiri at Sushi Moto, because their fish is fresh and their cuts are well done.</li><li>The fish was very fresh.</li><li>I travel a lot so I 've become somewhat critical of sushi and though the fish itself was quite fresh, the overpowering sweetness of the rice made this sushi something I would n't consider even trying again.</li><li>Sushi moto is our go to sushi place The sushi is always fresh, service is always quick We come here once every week or 2 and are always happy with everything I love their maki- lots of creative options- my personal faves are the fire roll, Cali roll, tiger 's tail and dynamite Their tempura is fresh and not too breaded My husband really likes the chirashi- the fish is very fresh and the selection is good too We regularly also get the maki combo 1 for dinner- it 's a great deal and it 's enough for 2 people I also love their complimentary soup.</li><li>The fish is fresh, the staff is attentive ( sometimes a touch overattentive, and a little touchy-feely), and the bar is new and clean.</li><li>I 've been to both AYCE and a la carte places and really enjoyed the atmosphere and variety of fish the offer.</li><li>Over all, the quality of the fish here is very good.</li><li>Those of you who complain about the cost of it deserve to go to the AYCE joints and `` enjoy'' the paper thin cuts of weeks old fish.</li><li>I 'd wish green tea would be hotter and there would n't be a TV screen visible from no matter where you sit, but other than that, the service so far has been fast and attentive, no plastic plates or cups, the fish is very fresh, rolls are of good size and nicely presented.</li><li>The fish on top was soft and well cooked.</li><li>The crablet is my favorite, the rolls, and the fish are beyond expectation.</li><li>I always get the sushi, sashimi, and maki boats, which is great if you want to try many different types of fish.</li><li>The fish is fresh the service is impeccable.</li><li>In the back they had a deli with fresh meats, fish and the largest pre cooked deli options I 've seen.</li><li>They had salads, eggplant, veggies to the cooked meat from chicken in various styles from baked, breaded and stuffed to fish and pork.</li><li>They also feature a full selection of canned fish.</li><li>We ordered fish &amp; chip ( $ 14), halibut steak ( $ 17) and calamari ( $ 10).</li><li>There is no meat but they do serve fish items.</li><li>Tov-li is kosher and does n't serve any meat ( save fish), so its not your thing for you carnivores out there.</li><li>This kosher, Cholov Yisrael dairy restaurant does pizza, dessert, veggie burgers, sandwiches, all day Israeli-style breakfast, falafel, ice-cream, soups and fish.</li><li>The fish is not fresh at all.</li><li>The sushi was really good and the fish was fresh.</li><li>We ordered the green curry chicken ( no flavor !!!!!) and the pineapple fried rice ( where was the pineapple ...... it was also smothered in dried fish ... is that where the flavor was supposed to come from ?)</li><li>The place is really really pricy, one would often find themselves paying over $ 6 per dish, so if you wanna splurge, get the fish.</li><li>The fish is bathed in chilli oil.</li><li>But spending $ 14, I 'd expect more fish.</li><li>Im giving this place 5 star for my love of fish in chili oil soupy dish.</li><li>The fish and flower tofu in chile oil is another personal favourite and their dandan noodles and yi bing oiled noodles are the best in the city.</li><li>Ceviche with various Seafood ( $ 12)- I almost mistaken this bowl of soup seafood as the Seafood Soup that we ordered- The `` broth'' the fully cooked shrimps, squid and fish were marinated in has really light citrus taste.</li><li>Each fish preparation rates its own sides.</li><li>At their best, they play off the superior freshness of the fish, which seems to be sustainable as well.</li><li>I was actually impressed by the seafood salad ( $ 23) which was mostly fish, shrimp, and a large crab cake rather than greenery with microscopic pieces of unidentifiable bits.</li><li>Lets start with the fish ...</li><li>The fish was perfectly cooked, and flavours in the sauce complimented it really well.</li><li>I have never been to Japan so this is probably not what it looks like at all, but this restaurant embodies what I, as an American, think it looks like: Bamboo colored wood, those paper window doors, paper lanterns, coi fish, etc., the servers even wore cute kimono inspired outfits.</li><li>Really enjoyed the Maki- nice and fresh fish, and the specialty rolls are very well done.</li><li>For the roll, we were unable to taste the assorted fish ( as described).</li><li>Always exceptionally fresh and very tasty -- I am extremely sensitive when it comes to fish not being fresh.</li><li>The fish was amazing, portions are huge and prices are very reasonable, especially for how good it was.</li><li>The sushi sported a generous amount of fish to rice ratio.</li><li>Here the delicate cuts to the fish can be seen and the recommendations by the chef can be made.</li><li>I 'm always hesitant when it comes to cream cheese and fish but I 've got to say the very subtle touch of it in this roll worked amazingly.</li><li>Fridays are $ 1 more .. which I do n't mind paying!:) Sushi Lunch A ( $ 7.95)- 6 pieces of nigiri sushi and 6 pieces of avocado roll and a chicken yakitori- The fish is really thinly cut with a little ball of rice ..</li><li>They also put the wasabi in the fish, as what most restaurants should do unless otherwise requested.</li><li>Fish is fresh, fair amount of variety.</li><li>DO order the rolls and the sashimi, the fish tastes fresh and you get good value for the price paid.</li><li>What sets this place apart is the attention to details on the food, and the freshness of their fish.</li><li>We wanted to get some a la carte sashimi, but it seems like they were out of all the higher end fish.</li><li>The fish itself was good and felt fresh.</li><li>They have incredible special roles, and their normal maki rolles use extremely fresh fish.</li><li>Fish tasted fresh, was very crispy.</li><li>It has a wide selection of great food from the raw fish to the cooked entrees and everything in between.</li><li>The fish and avocado was very fresh and the service ( albeit slow) was very friendly- even the chef 's greeted me with overwhelming warmth!</li><li>The fish is fresh and the temperature is just right.</li><li>It has raw shrimp, salmon, white fish, white tuna, and hamachi.</li><li>The grilled mackerel is ok and can be better though the fish is fresh Overall it is a average Japanese restaurant.</li><li>The fish was pretty fresh and on par with other Japanese restaurants and they even provided two pieces of the higher quality cuts of salmon which are fattier than the common salmon pieces and so much more yummier.</li><li>The fish does not look and taste appealing.</li><li>The fish is perfectly seasoned with a crispy grilled exterior and the inside is heavenly tender and juicy all around.</li><li>The fish was fresh and there 's a good ratio of salmon to rice ( i.e. not too much rice).</li><li>The fish was fresh, the staff were attentive, and there were decent apps that I did n't expect to get ( always a nice surprise!).</li><li>Fresh fish, genuinely attentive service, and a great atmosphere, all at affordable prices.</li><li>Fish is always fresh but is missing that wow factor when I eat it.</li><li>I never have sent food back before so like an idiot I ate one hell of a smelly fish.</li><li>First of all the fish/sushi was not fresh fish at all seems as though the server quickly brought it to us so I 'm assuming it was prepared hours ago or maybe even day ( s) old as in the sushi was sitting around for a while ...</li><li>I believe they 've given us banchan ( lots of it when we brought a large party), small pieces of fish ( the flesh on the bones they have after the cut off the rest), etc.</li><li>Their fish is always fresh and the service is always friendly and fast.</li><li>The fish itself was good.</li><li>Very tasty fish and chips joint!</li><li>The fries are your regular thick cut, kind of soft fish and chip fries.</li><li>The fish was very good, cooked perfectly with a thick batter.</li><li>After reading reviews, we decided to give it a go and were stoked thinking we may have found a great fish and chip joint.</li><li>To me, it tasted as though the oil the fish was fried in needed changing.</li><li>So ... it 's not the worst fish and chip joint I 've been to and it 's certainly not the best.</li><li>But otherwise the fish is one of the best I 've had.</li><li>Next time, I will take a picture of my fish halfway eaten to show how well the batter stays attached to the fish.</li><li>Next time, I will take a picture of my fish halfway eaten to show how well the batter stays attached to the fish.</li><li>It remains crunchy, with a well cooked fish, not over fried, in nice clean oil.</li><li>My colleague and I eat fish with a dash of pepper, a squeeze of lemon and some malt vinegar.</li><li>Portions are great, fish is juicy and batter is neither too thick or greasy.</li><li>They 've got a variety of meat pies, and a variety of fish to choose from.</li><li>The fish was wet and too chewy.</li><li>Still, the food is so amazing and fresh, I still give this place FIVE STARS ALL DAY, SON!*****. the place is very clean. the fish i had was very fresh and the batter was very crispy. we also ordered the chicken pie which was good but the pie was taken out of the fridge in front of us and taken to the cook to be heated up. nothing special about the pie, a bit expensive in my opinion. it cost more than the fish. chips, fish and whatever has to be ordered separately. we did get free slices of brown bread with butter on the side. i just wish that they give a bit more on the plate than just a fish. weird.</li><li>Still, the food is so amazing and fresh,

Haddock, Cod and Halibut.</li><li>All tasted great with soft and flakey fish inside the light and non-greasy batter.</li><li>High Street is more that the average fish and chip place, they have so much more to offer, hence the name High Street Fish, Chips and ...</li><li>High Street is more that the average fish and chip place, they have so much more to offer, hence the name High Street Fish, Chips and ...</li><li>High praise I know, their fish is fresh, and prepared in a light batter.</li><li>The closest I have come to finding battered fish similar to that found in the UK.</li><li>Walking into High Street Fish and Chips on this Saturday for an early dinner made me wondering if I am in Toronto anymore ...</li><li>The shop looks like nothing from the outside but the halibut with chips are simply amazing. i have n't gotten a chance to eat anything else here, since all i ever get is fish and chips. pretty heavy meal, bring an empty stomach and expect to be stuffed! if you been to Olde Yorke Fish n Chips, this is on par or better since the Olde Yorke `` waterdown'' their fish nowadays.</li><li>The shop looks like nothing from the outside but the halibut with chips are simply

Fish n Chips, this is on par or better since the Olde Yorke `` waterdown'' their fish nowadays.</li><li>Overall still one of the better and consistently good fish and chip joints in the city.</li><li>Maybe it was just my order but I found my fish to be a little dry when cutting it up.</li><li>The fish is always fresh and the batter is crispy and just right Even the tartar sauce is homemade.</li><li>You get a large piece of fish that is not overly battered or greasy with a big portion of delicious fries.</li><li>This is a quality Scottish mom and pop fish ' n chip shoppe.</li><li>Batter was right, fries were good and most important, the fish was big.</li><li>You do get a very generous size fish when you order haddock n chips.</li><li>The size of the fish is like a size 7 in shoes size.</li><li>The owner was originally frank mcnies who had a very successful fish and chips shop in etobicoke.</li><li>Best fish and chips place I have been to in Toronto/GTA!</li><li>The fish is great, but the fries are mehh.</li><li>What a shame: they have a great wood-fired oven and could use it to make awesome pizza and other meats or fish but alas ...... the pasta is okay.</li><li>They have a Live fish tank, so you can order fish, Vancouver crabs, lobsters and usually some type of clams or scallops or whatever they have in the tank, and specify how you like it cooked.</li><li>The fish that I ordered was very small in size and has no fish flavor.</li><li>Fish is fresh and presented nicely.</li><li>The fish was really gag worthy and not fresh at all.</li><li>Fresh fish and delicate sushi at an AYCE ?</li><li>Besides the usual, fresh fish well cut and good amount of vinegar in the rice, there are a lot of extra 's that many sushi houses do not add.</li><li>GOOD ratio of fish: rice, not packed like most places.</li><li>Nigiri had too much rice while fish was proportionally very small.</li><li>Nigiri pieces have super thin slices of fish.</li><li>The ingredients were n't fresh: soggy fish and bland overly frozen shimp in the tempura shimp.</li><li>Tried a variety of fish, photo added is of salmon, white tuna, squid, and mackerel.</li><li>Fish was fresh, but I 've had nicer salmon.</li><li>Choices that have been a miss: fried squid, lumpia ( lacking flavor), fried fish ( overpriced for the few pieces you get).</li><li>Then the main courses came, as we had steaks last night we chose dishes involving fish.</li><li>The sole stuffed with crab, again that hollandaise sauce and the fish was not any sole I 've eaten before.</li><li>The pungence of fish was overpowering.</li><li>If you 're not a steak person, the menu has many options such as fish and chicken.</li><li>Diced chicken and salty fish bits make an interesting combination that I always crave for more:) 4.</li><li>The smell of fish was still there but it was quite good.</li><li>The green beans with fish were a little burned in taste the one time I tried ' em.</li><li>Eggplant &amp; Minced Pork Spicy Sauce in Hot Pot ( $ 8.75) was overly sweet with no spiciness or the `` fish fragrance'' Garlic Shoots with Garlic ( $ 8.75) was a little oily but was the best dish of the evening.</li><li>Special mixed seafood congee ( regular size) was enough for two, full of fresh- not frozen- fish ( white fish and salmon) plus scallops, shrimps and squid.</li><li>Their steamed whole fish was actually good.</li><li>The fish was fresh and cooked perfectly.</li><li>They have fish in the aquarium again too!</li><li>I personally thought the way the salads were presented was beautiful. really fresh fish for its low price. this sushi resaurant is actually one of the oldest in north york area since 1999 ( ? im pretty sure) when u enter, sushi bar greets u with irashaimasen and ur immediately seated by a waitress or waiter. hot green tea is usually given as soon as you seat down and after you order, some free edamame and tofu comes out. then u get the food u ordered ( fast) and ur tea is never emptied bc of the constant refill and quality checks. the place is old but i looks neat.</li><li>The sashimi was clearly defrosted, as required by law, but the freezing was not to the detriment of how delicate and fresh-tasting the fish was.</li><li>Free: miso soup, tofu appetizer Bento box: tempura ( good), salad ( meh), 6 california rolls ( good), chap jae ( ok), bulgogi ( ok) My friend told me their chirashi is good and that their fish is really fresh.</li><li>Fresh fish and good pricing.</li><li>With a wealth of other sushi offerings on Yonge street it might be well advised to make a detour elsewhere. alway busy, like ram-crammed. the service tends to be a bit harried, but always friendly. the hae-dup bap is good here, if not typical. except they have two options: japanese-style or korean-style. js is chunks of fish and ks is slivers. personally, i prefer the ks, because the fish gets incorporated into the salad and rice so each mouthful is balanced. nothing to scream about- positively or negatively. just a good option. oh, the lighting is glaringly bright. do n't bring an ugly date.</li><li>So I concluded either their fish is not fresh or they dont know how to make spicy rolls.</li><li>Otherwise, really great food and fresh fish.</li><li>The fish was so thin.</li><li>Delicious cuts of fish are prepared and presented by proper sushi chefs.</li><li>The portions are smaller, fish is not as fresh.</li><li>I think there was a good 5 different fish on there.</li><li>We got fish &amp; tofu, chicken and broccoli, and rice.</li><li>They have a good selection of European products, salads, spreads, fish, fruit and vegetables.</li><li>I ordered the Calamari and the Seafood Linguini, and also tried the Fish and Chips and Philly Cheesesteak appetizer.</li><li>The Fish and Chips are also hard to mess up, and tasted alright, but they overcooked the fish in my opinion.</li><li>There was an abundance of seafood which includes squid, shrimp, clams, white fish ... etc.</li><li>Side dishes: lettuce, bean sprouts, kimchii, sweet radish, kimchii flavored radish and peanuts with little dried fish The meal was good but nothing really stood out for me.</li><li>The fish, unlike at other sushi places, is served in a nice size and at the right temperature.</li><li>The fish was fresh and it was definitely a good way to spend NYE at home!</li><li>The fish was drowning in sauce, and it was served in a nearly flat platter ( not smart for something so saucy).</li><li>He had to dig for fish, he failed to find any meat on the fish and after a bit he gave up and asked to change his order.</li><li>He had to dig for fish, he failed to find any meat on the fish and after a bit he gave up and asked to change his order.</li><li>She tried to get him to pay for the fish AND the second plate he ordered in replacement based on the logic that he `` ate half the fish'' already.</li><li>She tried to get him to pay for the fish AND the second plate he ordered in replacement based on the logic that he `` ate half the fish'' already.</li><li>Funny part is, her observation further confirmed the part about him not finding any meat in the fish to begin with.</li><li>We order the Fish Curry Hot Pot which is heated up in a pot with the fish and sauce on top of a piece of paper.</li><li>The sauce is a bit thick and I cannot taste the fish.</li><li>The sauce is too strong to take away the taste and smell of the fish.</li><li>The fish was prepared, so that it melted in your mouth.</li><li>Now onto the food: Pad thai: rice noodles, carrots, peanuts, tofu, green onions, bean sprouts, coriander, egg, fish, and tamarind sauce with chicken.</li><li>The crispy duck pancakes and the fish that my parents ordered were also cold too!</li><li>Decor, space, and service were all amazing BUT the food was n't ( mind you this is dependent if you fancy Mongolian cuisine) I surprisingly found the curry fish to taste scrumptious but other items such as friend potato and noodles to be bland and in some cases very oily I would recommend this for someone craving traditional Chinese cuisine but if you are like me who enjoy Hakka style more I would avoid this place.</li><li>The fish tastes fresh and service was great.</li><li>I ordered 3 different types with a buddy and the tempura in all 3 of them was soggy and it also contained barely any fish ( like 5 parts tempura 1 part fish).</li><li>Fish doesnt taste as fresh and bland rolls.</li><li>Very cheap the quality of the fish is not the greatest I guess you get what you pay for.</li><li>Quality of the meet was poor and the fish was n't fresh.</li><li>You can get other stuff here such as phalowrie ( ?) fish, doubles, patties and plantain.</li><li>We ordered the escargot, seafood platter ( I think that 's what it was called, it consisted of shrimp, salmon, lobster tail, and another type of fish ... all very delicious), and 1.5lbs of lobster broiled ( highly recommend very delicious), garlic bread, and baked potato.</li><li>There 's a pretty generous serving of giant shrimps, salmon, scallops, squid, and some other fish in each bowl.</li><li>So out of the 6 dishes we ordered, both congees ( especially the pumpkin) and the fish were the standouts.</li><li>Congee was mediocre at best, the fish inside was so rubbery that I could not eat it.</li><li>The green beans with pork, olive and dried fish is fantastic.</li><li>Congee Queen has a huge menu and lots of delicious options to choose from that range from vegetarian, seafood &amp; fish to all sorts of meats!</li><li>Try the fish and rice.</li><li>Did not have problems with the sashimi however on TWO separate occasions, the fish in the salmon maki was spoiled ... had an eerie colour of Plasticine ... the type you played with whilst in kindergarten .... tasted like it too ... my friend was peeing out of his butt after one episode.</li><li>Toss fish onto rice and call it Nigiri ...</li><li>The seasoning of the rice is perfect and it still has a bit of warmth ( not warm warm but not cold and brittle) to contrast the cold fish.</li><li>With the high turnover rate of Sushi Bong orders, the fish stays fresh and delicious.</li><li>The fish is n't `` melt-in-your-mouth'' kind of awesome-fresh, but it 's fresh enough to be good.</li><li>They 're generous with the fish.</li><li>They do n't skimp out on the ingredients and the fish is decent and fresh.</li><li>This location is better than the sushi bong north of Yonge and Steeles because they do n't skimp on the fish!</li><li>I find the fish just okay; it 's never particularly fresh and sometimes my sushi/sashimi looks like a questionable end piece of the fish.</li><li>However, my one major downside is that the fish is kind of bland.</li><li>Deducting one star as sometimes I do n't want to have to eat it in the car before a movie at Empress Walk ... more than 3 seats would be nice! korean-run close to yonge-finch. they 're very quick, and the portions are huge and quite tasty- especially the dynamite roll. the fish is n't always that fresh and not seasoned properly, so i 'd avoid the sushi/sashimi and stick with the rolls. but very good value. my main criticism is the owner 's wife- sometimes she yells uncontrollably and it 's not clear who she 's yelling at- the customer or the sushi chefs or perhaps she needs psychological evaluation.</li><li>The fish was fresh enough, but I have definitely had better elsewhere.</li><li>Used to be somewhat descent, but the quality of food had gone down, I think the fish is not as fresh anymore!</li><li>Turnover is large so the fish keeps fresh.</li><li>It 's a small place with no gimmicks, but the service is fast and the fish quality is really great.</li><li>If you are looking for super fresh high end fish or quality over quantity, go elsewhere.</li><li>Come on !!! and tax included! it tastes quite fresh too! the sushi here is soo cheap yet sooo gooood ( for the price). i ended up walking out with about 160 pieces of sushi and only paid $ 132 dollars ( including the party plastic tray which is around 10-13 dollars extra and tax) which is a VERY GOOD price compared to other sushi places. tastes are slightly above average. fresh fish and more.</li><li>The size of the rolls are huge the dynamite rolls are stuffed with fresh fish, tempura shrimp and veggies topped with a fish of choice and fish roe.</li><li>Their rice is amazing, fish fresh, their fish: rice is as it should be and their service is so abrupt and rude that is it somewhat amusing and makes for good lunch time conversation if you are stuck for discussion topics with your companion.</li><li>Their rice is amazing, fish fresh, their fish: rice is as it should be and their service is so abrupt and rude that is it somewhat amusing and makes for good lunch time conversation if you are stuck for discussion topics with your companion.</li><li>Their fish is fresh, and their rolls are generously portioned.</li><li>The Hae Du Bap had like about 80g of chopped up assorted fish in which about 25% of it was chewy salmon yuck.</li><li>Very slim slices of fish in the rolls.</li><li>Great value and fish is always fresh from the high volume they serve.</li><li>Now they 've gotten busy and opened another location at yonge and steeles the fish has gotten super thin and the price has been raised.</li><li>Fresh fish and good service ...</li><li>My friend liked it a lot, generous portion of fish.</li><li>Excellent noodles and good amount of fish.</li><li>My husband got the sashimi lunch and raved about the fish.</li><li>The fish is fresh and the rice portions are perfect, not too much not too little.</li><li>Wide selection of fresh, high quality fish, beautiful presentation, reasonable prices, friendly staff.</li><li>And where are my tiny dried chewy fish and fermented tofu strips ?!?</li><li>They do n't offer any vegetarian dishes, as it may come in contact with their plethora of meats and fish, but their food is incredibly tasty.</li><li>Chiu Chow Congee ( Dried Fish, Oyster Dices, Minced Pork) although not flavourful soup as others, it also means less saltiness which is a positive comment.</li><li>Asked for chicken but hey look you got fish.</li><li>The fish is always fresh and delicious!</li><li>Fried goodness on the outside with a mix of raw fish in the roll topped with spicy sauce.</li><li>They are also very good about using different slicers for vegan, vegetarian, fish and meat.</li><li>The fish is fresh and the sushi absolutely is solidly good.</li><li>Nice balanced Shari rice, crunchy seaweed rolls and fresh fish.</li><li>The spicy tuna roll was well done; the fish was very fresh, and not too much rice- albeit very small for 7.95.</li><li>All the fish was quite fresh.</li><li>The fish was fresh, but by no means generous, and the rice could have been better.</li><li>I was really impressed with the quality and presentation of the fish.</li><li>Is n't cucumber cheaper than fish ?</li><li>Also, Instead of politely telling her that she could n't replace the fish.</li><li>I would definitely come back for this dish again, reasonably priced around $ 20. after my last two trips to my former favourite sushi restaurant in the area, i 've confirmed that i need a new spot. two replacement orders `` on the house'' just does n't cut it when the fish is still slimy and greyish. decor is still nice though. maybe just stick to drinks or non-fish items ?</li><li>Food: I will admit that the fish was fresh.</li><li>The boat was quite good as well -- quite the selection of different fish.</li><li>The fish was acceptable, but not impressive.</li><li>But the fish was fresh.</li><li>Sushi and rolls were below average and really showcased that not raw fish and maki is created equal!</li><li>Their fish is horribly cooked- dry and tough- and their holiday specials ( e.g., lobster thermidor) are poorly done and not worth the hefty surcharge.</li><li>Some faves include the prime rib, crab legs ( cold better than hot), spicy chicken, bbq pork ribs, wings, dimsum, fried fish w Tartar, scallop cutlets, the hot waffles with strawberries and whipped cream, the macaroons, and the creme brulee for dessert.</li><li>The rolls and fish was very fresh.</li><li>It seemed as though some fresh fish had been mixed with stale fish, maybe to try to get rid of the old one.</li><li>It seemed as though some fresh fish had been mixed with stale fish,

other than the waitress came to speak to us, and all the waitress kept saying is that their fish is always fresh.</li><li>We left wondering if we made a mistake trying to even eat part of our meal, in case it was all bad fish.</li><li>The fish came in a tower shape, with flying fish eggs, over a delicious salad.</li><li>Someone posted a pic of a hair in the fish !!!</li><li>It always has consistent fresh fish and is a great deal with salads and Korean pancakes that are on the house.</li><li>My favourite though is the hwedupbap ( basically a salad with raw fish).</li><li>Hwedupbap is very fresh with a good amount of raw fish.</li><li>The fish here is pretty fresh.</li><li>I did n't order any raw fish, so i cannot comment on how fresh their fish is.</li><li>I did n't order any raw fish, so i cannot comment on how fresh their fish is.</li><li>I keep returning because the fish is fresh ( the slices of salmon sashimi are large), they have good prices and it is my go to place for buying salmon sashimi by the pound when I do takeout.</li><li>Ca n't speak for the fish.</li><li>Quality for the fish is quite good ... as my lunch specials though does not come with any salad or miso soup

teppan table experience tonight was nothing more than watching him cook our fish and some veggies.</li><li>Sushi was good -- the fish was quite fresh.</li><li>The fish was n't fresh.</li><li>The spicy salmon sushi is just leftover trimmings of the salmon nigiri that get put on a roll of rice with some spicy mayo tossed in there, which would be fine if the fish was at least fresh.</li><li>Fish is fresh but on some orders the slices are slight.</li><li>$ 24.95 for A thin piece of fish, two shrimps, and beef.</li><li>Then you pick your meat ( chicken, beef, pulled pork, pulled beef, fish and shrimp) and toppings ( four salsas, cheese, beans, sour cream, lettuce).</li><li>I would recommend the pulled steak ( second would be the pulled pork followed by chicken and shrimp- both chicken and shrimp are a little bland from my experience- I have yet to try the fish).</li><li>Sandwiches, pizza, made to order, salads, chicken, fish, rice balls, espressos and a full bar.</li><li>( Oh not to mention that walking past their fish stand, they just had frozen fish in their plastic shrink wrap packaging on display ... what the hell ?</li><li>They also included a soup starter, steamed fish, a rice dish, a noodle dish, and some veggies.</li><li>The fish although was first deep fried had a surprising super moist flakey meat!</li><li>The steam sea bass was alright, they soy sauce really goes well with the fish.</li><li>Food wise it 's ok, fish is good for ayce.</li><li>Do n't try other dishes like stirring fried vermicelli ( poor portion and bland, for all the Cantonese dishes, I recommend congee Wong nearby) or traditional Chinese dishes like fish flavoured pork slices ( 鱼香肉丝 ）, sweat &amp; sour fish is a big joke ... check out my photos--it 's even a joke for the Westerners, okay ?</li><li>Do n't try other dishes like stirring fried vermicelli ( poor portion and bland, for all the Cantonese dishes, I recommend congee Wong nearby) or traditional Chinese dishes like fish

tasteless and the spicy fish we ordered was downright disgusting.</li><li>This was two months ago, now I ca n't get him off of my back about raw fish.</li><li>The kimchi was delicious, fish was fresh and nicely cut and they served a good quality green tea.</li><li>My mom got some sort of fish which is no longer on the menu, or modified cause I can no longer find it.</li><li>I was eating their AYCE lunch and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of their fish and their kitchen food.</li><li>The sushi was underwhelming and on the bland side due to the rice, some of the fish were fresher than others.</li><li>My friends who eat fish/ meat said everything that they ordered tasted great and was good quality.</li><li>The rice to fish balance for their rolls its quite good for an AYCE

with radish shavings, but the actual fish was good.</li><li>The fish is fantastic.</li><li>If the fish was fresh, I might have felt a little better about the prices.</li><li>In the bento box the fish is ok and the tofu was meh, but nothing outstanding overall.</li><li>The fish was not fresh, and certainly not tasty.</li><li>We said okay no problem, THEN another 15 minutes later we get our cucumber maki roll and the plate was DIRTY, oily, had fish pieces and mystery crumbs.</li><li>We had a sashami platter, and you can definately taste the difference between regular fish, and katsura fish ( however, if you go to vancouver, it does taste this fresh with a third of the cost).</li><li>I was shocked when the fish was crispy and so fresh!</li><li>The salmon did not taste or smell fishy at

kids had ribs and liked them too.</li><li>A LOT more rice than fish.</li><li>Came with two very thin slices of lemon, wished they could give bigger slices, goes well with the fish.</li><li>Tried cow ribs soup ( so small), grilled fish ( I swear the fish weights less than 0.5lb), and rice sausage ( flavour was bland, no seasoning) Not coming here again that 's for sure.</li><li>The fish was also over fried.</li><li>The fish was a little fishy.</li><li>When he came by with the pitcher of water, he told us that the fish would be another 2 mins.</li><li>4-5 mins later, the fish came.</li><li>When he did come back, after we had completed our meals ( my girlfriend left 3/4 of her fish), he offered dessert.</li><li>There are over 15 main entrees one can choose from including pasta, meat, fish and pizzas.</li><li>My relatives enjoyed the salmon filet ( fish of the day), veal marsala, and veal chop, and were all satisfied, with the exception of one who argued the veal chop was too dry for her.</li><li>Never, under any circumstances order fish or shrimp dishes here.</li><li>It was $ 13 and we got 2 small fillets worth of fish.</li><li>Hence, if the place is called Belly
