<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 16' %><h2>chicken<br />occurrence: 469</h2><div><ol><li>The dressing is perfect and there 's a good amount of chicken.</li><li>They have a ton of other items from sandwiches, meatloaf, chicken, soups, bagels, and even Montreal Smoked meat.</li><li>I told the waitress `` NO ONIONS, NO EGGS, NO CHICKEN, NO BEEF, NO SEAFOOD, and NO GREEN PEPPERS ( the green peppers was a choice).''</li><li>Great service, great price, fantastic food, fava beans were incredible and chicken is moist and delicious.</li><li>It was called a corn cake and the description mentioned chicken.</li><li>But recently, we tried Friday- the lunch special, chicken was so dry; I think they cooked a huge batch of chicken and put sauce on top when orders came.</li><li>I spent over $ 50.00 for take out and they threw in 1/2 a chicken.</li><li>The chicken was virtually tasteless, except salty in a watery sauce. the vegetable was in the same type of sauce as well.</li><li>They conceded that the crust was good, but their pizza was bland and the chicken was dry.</li><li>I found the chicken a little grisly and once piece was inedible.</li><li>The taste was good, but it was n't a good mix with the chicken.</li><li>The toppings were also plentiful and excellently prepared- tasty tofu, chicken, shrimp, onion, pepper and peanut.</li><li>The chef had basically de-boned a whole chicken, roasted it till it was perfectly done -- the chicken was moist and tender, but the skin crispy -- including the stuffing which was pearly white tender grains of rice.</li><li>We ordered have had almost all they had on their menu, my favorite nontheless is their chicken and lamb shish kebob.</li><li>The Chicken finally came, and immediately my friend and I froze.</li><li>Moist and flavourful, and the chicken ( I tried a bite ..</li><li>The chicken was lightly seasoned and pretty good.</li><li>The chicken was juicy but the marinate could be more flavourful.</li><li>The chicken was not breaded and was tossed with a very mild black bean sauce.</li><li>And it was like $ 7 in my opinion not really worth it, the chicken was very dry and not seasoned well.</li><li>All the food here is good- tempura is well fried, chicken tasted like organic ( not sure it is, but it was so good!), and all the fish tasted so fresh and satisfying.</li><li>Only cons:- chicken tasted a bit like tofu ( strange ....)</li><li>The Spicy Chicken Dinner is served with a delicious citrus-laced salad and flavourful miso soup to start followed by a platter of skinless, spicy, saucy chicken on a bed of well-seasoned vegetables ( mainly onions).</li><li>This is served with a side of plain rice but the chicken is delicious enough to eat on its own!</li><li>Chicken was well marinated, seasoned, and cooked.</li><li>They had salads, eggplant, veggies to the cooked meat from chicken in various styles from baked, breaded and stuffed to fish and pork.</li><li>Chicken was a cutlet and hot and delicious. the mustard was different and definitely of European style.</li><li>The chicken was tender, with rice in the middle.</li><li>The whole chicken, stuffed with glutinous rice, was a good size to share, and the meat was so tender!</li><li>The chicken was rough and overcooked.</li><li>My friend 's soup was really good, flavourful and the chicken was so tender.</li><li>Our soup came with a whole tiny chicken which was fall off the bone tender, the broth had some subtle flavours from the ginseng and dates, nothing overwhelming but in a word `` soul-satisfying.''</li><li>The chicken was ultra tender and was falling off the bones, making it a pretty easy meal.</li><li>Chicken Ginseng Soup supposed to be good for your health and consume especially during the hottest day of the year.</li><li>Nevertheless the chicken soup itself- the chicken was so silky and soft- I 'm craving another one already!</li><li>The chicken is super tender but did not have a whole lot of flavour either.</li><li>Whole chicken was very moist, soft, fall-off-the-bone.</li><li>Inside the chicken is stuffed with sticky rice and a date.</li><li>The chicken was very tender and soft but the ginseng was very subtle unless you get to the sticky rice filling where you find the ginseng, korean date, and chestnut.</li><li>Inside the chicken is some stuffing consisting of rice, a date, and a small piece of ginseng.</li><li>The chicken has been cooking in the soup for a very long time.</li><li>The chicken is fall off the bone, but because it 's been cooking for so long it 's become quite dry and tasteless really.</li><li>The chicken is organic, stuffed with sticky rice on the inside and comes with a small side of rice noodles which you can place in the soup.</li><li>They added a few different soups that are not chicken but beef, and not just any beef, it 's beef intestines and/or blood pudding.</li><li>The chicken soup had about half a chicken and the broth was really clean and light in flavouring.</li><li>None of us went for the seemingly notorious ginger chicken, but from what I can recall, the sweet and sour chicken balls, the fried dumplings, the chicken thing my gal ordered, and the crispy beef were all delicious, served fast, and priced right.</li><li>The best dish was probably the chicken, nice crispy outside and tender inside.</li><li>For the beef of course, but also to revisit the other chicken and shrimp dishes I sampled.</li><li>I had a serious craving for General Tsao 's Chicken and this place was closest to my home so I thought I 'd check it out.</li><li>The Singapore noodle was excellent, lots of chicken, pork, and shrimp!</li><li>But the food is absolutely wonderful. we are regular customer, s at this restaurant, Tonight we ordered the usual, our favourte dish is peanut chicken, we brought our three dish, s home and upon opening the chicken we saw half the dish was peanut sauce and less than half the usual amount of chicken, I called the restaurant and spoke to the owner for ten minutes, she insisted that it was made the same as always, It was not at all, we paid 11,95 for peanut sauce and a small amount of chicken,, The arrogant owner could not care less, refusing to credit us for next time we picked up, or d delivering a new dish to our home, This place the staff is unfriendly, not well mannered, and horrible customer service, and the food was awful, except for the fried rice, it was good, If your looking for bad service this is the place to go, the customer is never right,, be warned,.</li><li>But the food is

is the place to go, the customer is never right,, be warned,.</li><li>The guys behind the counter here are pretty generous with the amount of rice, vegetables ( e.g. lettuce, pickel, onions, beets), and chicken they pile on your plate.</li><li>The chicken is shaved off a rotating cooker, and re-grilled right before serving, which means the meat stays tender but hot on your plate.</li><li>Perhaps I did n't add enough sauce and spreads to my wrap, but I still thought the chicken was on the drier side.</li><li>The service and quality of food is extremely disappointing as chicken was their only option since they burned their beef.</li><li>The chicken itself has a pretty good flavor, but the wilted lettuce and sorry looking toppings always have me disappointed, and somehow there were fruit flies buzzing around all the veggies even though it 's- 4 degrees out ..</li><li>I 've tried both the chicken and beef thinking that maybe I was picking the wrong kind of meat.</li><li>The chicken is always juicy and fresh- The reason being is that they have lots of customers and when they are slow they turn down the roaster on the spike and when they get a rush of customers they turn it back on and make sure u get fresh juicy meat right off the spike!</li><li>The chicken in the shawarma was very good.</li><li>The chicken in both these dishes wasnt cut up properly, the broccoli pieces were the size of my fist ... i could go go on ...</li><li>My main problem was that the chicken was largely tasteless without sauce.</li><li>I do n't mean to imply the chicken was undercooked to the point it was raw.</li><li>The chicken was tender and yummy.</li><li>The melt-in-your-mouth goat curry is my usual order, but the chicken is awesome and the channa and spinach is so good and perfect for when you 're feeling a little vegetarian.</li><li>The pieces of chicken were big pieces and i had a bite of chicken in every bite.</li><li>This left the chicken, rice, peppers, peanuts, and other veggies like broccoli and cauliflower.</li><li>A bed of soft noodles loaded up on top with Shrimps, Chicken, Beef, BBQ Pork and fresh Veggies.</li><li>MY CHICKEN WASN' T COOKED.</li><li>The chicken is battered and fried in a light and crispy batter that held up to the sauce very well.</li><li>The chicken was perfectly cooked with a nice thick sauce that had a wonderful flavor.</li><li>It came with spring rolls, chicken and beef skewer along with some meat pieces.</li><li>It was not bad: the chicken was moist and tasty ( even better with the gingery dipping sauce) and the rice could have been more flavorful but ok.</li><li>I get the whole ' cooking with the skin and bone adds flavour' but it 's just too much work to eat and the chicken can tend to be undercooked, as it was in my case.</li><li>This dish ended up being mostly rice, a bit of potato and, after discarding all of the overly pink and red pieces, very little chicken.</li><li>From looking at the menu, I thought the chicken is boneless but no I was wrong.</li><li>So I thought if it has bone then the chicken should be flavourful.</li><li>The chicken is not fresh, I could taste the chicken was left in the fridge for awhile.</li><li>The chicken is not fresh, I could taste the chicken was left in the fridge for awhile.</li><li>Recommend dishes: Fish/Beef in spicy pungent sauce, mo yu duck, fu qi fei pian, spicy chicken, A choy with Garlic.</li><li>HUGE pieces of LEAN chicken, clean Thai basil and Vietnamese greens, ( including bean sprouts), and the tables and condiments are always clean.</li><li>Soup was slightly salty, but we devoured the noodles ( cooked perfectly), the soft, luscious chicken and other vegetables.</li><li>Same as I remember, hard to chew and really greasy ( i had the mix: Chicken and beef) but inexpensive.</li><li>The chicken was a tad dry too.</li><li>The chicken is moist and very flavourful and the rice and peas was actually quite good!</li><li>Not sure if it 's the Cajun but this chicken is so addictive!</li><li>The chicken is great and as expected.</li><li>In between they were serving other ppl with fresh spicy chicken.</li><li>Only reason they get 1 star is because the chicken was fresh.</li><li>They asked if we wanted it to be separate which was nice because at other locations they would just put them all into one box, which results in soggy chicken.</li><li>30 mins later back home, the chicken was super hot and juicy, dripping with chicken goodness ( not oil) with each bite.</li><li>The parking is still a nightmare, however this is one of the better locations with good service and fresh chicken.</li><li>The chicken and pork souvlaki are very tasty.</li><li>It had chicken, rice, two types of potatoes, salad, tzatziki, and pita.</li><li>The chicken was delicious but dried out.</li><li>3-4 star Speaking of the food, it was meh-ok, I had a salad with chicken breast and I found the chicken to be dry and overcooked, while the salad was pretty good and well dressed.</li><li>The pizzas beat any pizza place in the city, the parms ( eggplant, chicken or veal) are the best in the city and the sandwiches are hearty, filling and so good as well!</li><li>Merely 10 minutes from picking it up, the pesto became very oily and the chicken was a bit dry.</li><li>The chicken was perfectly done and here the sauce brought out the taste of the chicken.</li><li>The chicken was perfectly done and here the sauce brought out the taste of the chicken.</li><li>I do n't expect much for $ 8 so I am not complaining- the chicken yakitori served steaming hot! fogging up my camera .. the sauce is a little sweet, but the chicken was nice and moist Kiyomizu seems to be really popular with the office workers in the area during lunch time, every tables were occupied by the time I left.</li><li>I got the chicken Bento box and my total was under $ 10.</li><li>The chicken had a nice taste to it and was not watery like KFC but neither was it crunchy like Popeyes.</li><li>I drop in for their chicken whenever I 'm in their neighborhood which is n't too often unfortunately.</li><li>I was welcomed by a friendly cashier and ordered 2 Piece Combo ( $ 7.89 per 2 Piece Chicken, Choice of Salad, Choice of Tater or Fries, CAN of Pop).</li><li>Unfortunately an entire half of the chicken was gristle/connective tissue/inedible.</li><li>The chicken is crispy outside and juicy inside.</li><li>What is also notable about the way they prepare their chicken ( unlike all other chicken chains I can think of) is that all pieces are trimmed of excess fat and skin prior to preparation.</li><li>The portion is giant, the chicken is tender with crispy edges, they way I like it!</li><li>Big portions Actually fresh and tender chicken Get the diner plate Friendly dude that service.</li><li>My office used to be in the area and I would go there for a chicken shawarm pita religiously ( at least 3 times a week).</li><li>The chicken is always fresh ( they usually run out after lunch time and pop on a new skewer of chicken).</li><li>I often ask sasha the main shawarma maker to give me less chicken, its just too much meat for me to handle.</li><li>I LOVED the potatoes and the chicken was cooked perfectly.</li><li>The garlic potatoes are fantastic and you ca n't fault the chicken nor the rice.</li><li>Not the fanciest place around, BUT: the size of the pita pocket was HUGE, the chicken tasty, the vegetables definitely fresh, the hummous could have used a bit more garlic and lemon juice.</li><li>My friend got the chicken.</li><li>The chicken is moist.</li><li>The chicken was tender and the coleslaw was creamy which made for such a wonderful combination.</li><li>I guess what made it so good was that the chicken had nice flavor by itself.</li><li>Also, the chicken had a nice little char ( not burnt) texture on it which makes the outer layer almost crispy.</li><li>But you definitely should go here for the Sh awarma plate because it is so delicious and huge! popped in here during lunch, and of course it 's because I was craving my New York style chicken on the rocks. the portion was huge but it was n't satisfying. the rice was over cooked but the chicken was good- I was looking for that perfect garlic sauce but it was n't enough in the meal.</li><li>Their chicken and ribs was A-OK.</li><li>The chicken is nice and chunky and the salad is a good mix, try it with honey mustard dressing.</li><li>The chicken was so juicy and tender.</li><li>Their meat is tender and tasty as is their chicken.</li><li>The chicken is really really good.</li><li>I ordered the roasted chicken dinner, and the chicken was mushy.</li><li>Chicken is tender and juicy well mix with the rice and egg.</li><li>Chicken was a bit dry for me but the lamb and beef skewers were good.</li><li>We went with the chicken tabliyeh Saj wrap and a mixed combo platter which and assortment of items that included: beef and chicken shawarma, kofta, beef skewer and shish tawouk.</li><li>It 's not THAT good, it 's messy as heck ( the chicken and slaw fall out into the bag), and it 's gone up in price twice since I started going there.</li><li>The chicken was not too spicy and super moist, while the rice and peas had great flavour, and OMG the home made coleslaw!</li><li>Both items came out to about 5 dollars so definitely a good buy !! the chicken was very juicy and hot ( temperature), which made the sandwich that much better.</li><li>The fresh, in store baked coco bun makes such a very big difference, and the chicken itself is very tender and flavourful.</li><li>The spice of the chicken, the creaminess of the coleslaw and the sweetness of the bread.</li><li>I admit the coco bread was fresh, the slaw was a nice addition, however the chicken could be spicier.</li><li>I usually get a small pork, small chicken, two patties, and a coleslaw to share between two people.</li><li>The chicken was soft and delicious, even the smell was nice.</li><li>She ordered the chicken wrap. ( keep in mind that they were different names, I just do n't remember what the names were).</li><li>Chicken was over cooked and my family was complaining about the food.</li><li>When it comes to ordering, I always tend to get the Charcoal grilled Half Chicken as I love the spices and the char of the chicken.</li><li>The chicken was not that hot and it was very bland compared to what I generally come to expect when I visit Paramount.</li><li>Chicken Shawarma Sandwich- Shredded pieces of chicken grilled on a rotating spit with shredded lettuce, pickles and garlic sauce wrapped in a pita I really loved this, and chicken is usually at the bottom of my meat list.</li><li>The chicken was very tender and tasty and the sauce just brings out the delicious flavour without overpowering the chicken.</li><li>The chicken was very tender and tasty and the sauce just brings out the delicious flavour without overpowering the chicken.</li><li>I ordered the chicken and beef shawarama wrap for 14.59, 16.50 after tax i believe. it was a good sized portion.</li><li>The chicken and beef tasted juicy and their garlic mash sauce tasted really delicious.</li><li>Chicken was 4.95 which seems a little high for some chicken.</li><li>We bought home 3 other pies- Chicken, Minced beef and Steak and Ale.</li><li>The chicken pie is especially delicious with a nice balance of crust, creme, chicken and veggies.</li><li>I do n't think South Street even marinate their chicken ...</li><li>On my first try, the cook severely overcooked the chicken.</li><li>Well, because I 'm not convinced it is chicken.</li><li>Fung sai Gai is pretty good here, crispy, with plenty of fried garlic, with the chicken being pretty moist.</li><li>The chicken tasted ok but was swimming in its own grease as oil from the chinese sausage bled onto the lotus leaf as well.</li><li>Chicken Parmigiano with Penne marinara: portion, price, and the size of the chicken was more than enough.</li><li>The chicken is moist and exterior crisp.</li><li>I got it/ it 's chicken.</li><li>The broth was very nice but the chicken had slimy pieces of skin on it which do n't look appetizing and do n't have a texture I like.</li><li>The chicken itself was not freshly cooked.</li><li>Samgyetang is also on the Menu if you want the Whole Chicken to yourself.</li><li>Apkujung Restaurant 's Chicken Ginseng Soup with Noodle &amp; Congee ( $ 23/2 people servings) would be a dish that I would love to share with my friend or vice versa.</li><li>Then when the chicken is ready, the waitress would come and cut it up and serve that to you ..... then you wait again for the noodle to be cooked ... and she came back and serve you again .... then you wait for the congee to be cook, and now you have this congee that has all the nutrients from the chicken and ginseng that suppose to be really good for you ?!</li><li>Then when the chicken is ready, the waitress would come and cut it up and serve that to you ..... then you wait again for the noodle to be cooked ... and she came back and serve you again .... then you wait for the congee to be cook, and now you have this congee that has all the nutrients from the chicken and ginseng that suppose to be really good for you ?!</li><li>They changed the kind of chicken they used for the Ginseng Chicken.</li><li>The chicken has no taste, the soup had no taste, ca n't even see any ginseng in it._________________________________________________ It 's a very authentic and humble place.</li><li>The chicken is tender but not too tasty.</li><li>The glutinous rice that is stuffed in the chicken was stewed with ginseng and herbs, and it is steeped with the rich flavours of chicken and of course, the deep richness of ginseng.</li><li>Ate the Dak Hanmari as most suggested ( it was n't written like that in English, but it was on the first page of the menu as one of their main specials: Chicken, Noodle and Congee).</li><li>They still specialize in Chicken Ginseng Soup 3 course ( dak han mari) but it does n't taste as good as before.</li><li>The chicken was delicious as well.</li><li>The chicken was breaded and deep fried like KFC 's but for whatever reason, this chicken came out greasy and heavy tasting.</li><li>Ordered the garlic rice, kare kare, and crispy chicken in house sauce.</li><li>I bought regular chicken on the rocks the guy just put one spoon of rice and chicken.</li><li>The chicken in the wrap was not moist, and seemed quite dry.</li><li>Loved the tasty chicken and shrimp Pad Thai, and Vietnamese spring rolls ...</li><li>The chicken was good, but nothing overly special.</li><li>The menu offers up pizzas with an over emphasis on their chicken items as well.</li><li>I ordered their Chicken Teriyaki which came with a bowl of rice, miso soup and side dishes of potato, zucchini and sprouts.</li><li>The chicken was tender and cooked perfectly with just the right amount of grill on the meat ... smothered in teriyaki sauce and served over a bed of onions in a cast iron ... umm ... cow.</li><li>My favourite is the spicy chicken.</li><li>It comes with well the spicy chicken, rice, green beans ( best beans I 've ever eaten) and tofu.</li><li>Great Chicken, great gravy.</li><li>Chicken was okay nothing spectacular.</li><li>Got several lunch specials ( 1/4 chicken, coleslaw, rice with peas and gravy) and the Jamaican patty.</li><li>The chicken was absolutely delicious, nice and spicy and the rice and peas were great with the gravy.</li><li>The chicken is tender.</li><li>I loved the chicken I order as part of my fixed price menu- but the pasta appetizer just was that much better.</li><li>All in all- I will return for the flavoured soju and the chicken.</li><li>The food is decent too, we have the sweet and spicy chicken, seafood pancake, spicy seafood with rice cake.</li><li>Chicken was moist and the coating had a nice crunch to it.</li><li>I had the Chimichanga and it was very good, fresh and the chicken was so tender.</li><li>The quality of chicken was atrocius ... it was extremely dry- as if they used it from a frozen packet.</li><li>The chimichanga was very interesting- I guess the chicken was fried first and then they deep fry the tortilla once they put the chicken inside.</li><li>The ratio of chicken and shrimp to the amount of sauces was quite pathetic.</li><li>Pros: Amazing food, fast service, clean, and very cheap Cons: Can be pretty busy at lunch ... but I guess that 's an indicator that people really love this restaurant Recommendations: Congee- all of them are amazing General Tao Chicken- I 'm Filipino/Canadian and you know we love GT chicken!</li><li>We had the deep fried tentacles, some kind of rice with mushrooms, chicken and bok choi ( one of those green things that people steam ?) and it came in a hot bowl so that the rice at the botton was sticky and crunchy at the same time: D Also had the vermicelli that 's part of the special, congee with surf clam, choy sum with oyster sauce, hot and sour soup, my friend has the cheung fun and rice roll with duck in it, and rice cake with cabbage and some pork.</li><li>Rice with mushrooms- no. i do n't like this. i do n't really like rice that much and the chicken was bland.</li><li>Ordered: Dak-Gal-Bee ( JS-1) 4/5* Chicken ( boneless dark meat) and assorted vegetables ( cabbage, sweet potato and greeon onion)* Choose your spiciness ( we went with B. The Joons Original Spicy Sauce)* $ 9.25 per portion ( 2 portions minimum), we ordered 3 portions for 3 people* Extra Add On: rice cake, mozzarella cheese, instant noodle, vegetables and fried rice* Extra add ons are all $ 2 except the fried rice* Everything is thrown together and comes to your table uncooked* Because it 's chicken, they take a while to fully cook and it drives you crazy* Servers will come around and cook them for you so do n't worry about the process* If you order mozarella cheese, they come midway and add it on near the end* For 3 portion order, I found there were n't much chicken* Original spicy sauce is not spicy at all !!</li><li>Ordered: Dak-Gal-Bee ( JS-1) 4/5* Chicken ( boneless dark meat) and assorted vegetables ( cabbage, sweet potato and greeon onion)* Choose your spiciness ( we went with B.

I saw the beef shawarma, or shall I say, smelled it from a mile away:) It is a rare luxury to see a fresh .. succulent ( i feel dirty lol) ... beef shawarma grilling ... glistening on that hot turning stand lol yeah this is starting to sound a little raunchy, i know!</li><li>It came with a miso soup, edamame, and the bento box ( rice, salad, chicken, tofu, japchae). everything was average; the sauce on the chicken teriyaki was overpowering.</li><li>The chicken was very tender.</li><li>And when my friend asked if she could get the chicken in the pad thai changed to beef, I thought the soup nazi was going to finally make an appearance ... but he was perfectly accommodating.</li><li>The lamb curry was terrible, and the TANDOORI chicken were two crappy dehydrated old drumsticks.</li><li>I order off the special menu-chili chicken, wonton soup and an egg roll.</li><li>The chicken is battered and coated in a decent, slightly sweet but mostly hot sauce.</li><li>We got fish &amp; tofu, chicken and broccoli, and rice.</li><li>The chicken was juicy and full of flavour.</li><li>From chicken and rice to lamb shank to beef stew.</li><li>My pasta was well cooked, but the chicken tasted like something you would find in a McDonald 's salad and the mushrooms were good, but that was the basis of the dish.</li><li>When we got home to eat our food, my food was packed in a tray with three divisions, one for a few pieces of carrot and broccoli, one for linguine with tomato sauce, and in the middle was the breaded chicken.</li><li>The chicken was seasoned well enough, and the portion was large, but the pasta was nothing special as it was dried pasta, and the vegetables seemed like it was from frozen.</li><li>The chicken is tender and thick, topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella, &amp; parmesan cheese.</li><li>The chicken is still amazing the next day.</li><li>All the veggies were raw and the chicken was half-cooked so it took awhile for everything in the hotpot to to be fully cooked, but it was worth the wait!</li><li>The chicken was flavourful and tender, and the spiciness level was just right.</li><li>My date got the Chicken, which apparently was quite good.</li><li>The food was horrible, the chicken was under cooked, too sour, it was not stuffed with anything and it came with bones! spinach was below the chicken and the cheese was melted on top of the chicken chew skin: (, half a spoon of mashed potato that did not taste good and couple of carrots scattered around the dish.</li><li>The chicken was perfectly cooked and juicy.</li><li>The chicken was tender and the pieces were decently sized but this dish was nothing special.</li><li>Usually the chicken is mixed in with the curry.</li><li>The chicken was very tender, which I really enjoyed.</li><li>The dice was nice, but had only 5 thin pcs of an already small chicken.</li><li>And their curry chicken now uses some frozen, tasteless chicken from God knows where.</li><li>The curry was decent but she said it would 've been better if she picked seafood instead of the chicken.</li><li>Royal Pad Thai with Chicken was wrapped inside an egg wrap.</li><li>The chicken was pretty rough.</li><li>The curry had very weak flavour and the chicken was low quality, something I 'd expect from a fast food restaurant.</li><li>Apps we had included the mango salad ( standard), chicken and beef satay skewers were some of the worst I 've had anywhere, and the fried calamari had too much breading and was overly oily ( thought my kids loved it).</li><li>Would be a 5 if there was extra curry sauce and maybe if it was chicken AND shrimp rather than just one.</li><li>The chicken was really bland, and it had a really interesting/weird soft texture.</li><li>Our go to items are usually BBQ pork, roasted pork if they have ribs and half a chicken.</li><li>Chicken was ok- pork is better.</li><li>He ordered Singapore Noodles and was expecting the usual fried curry noodles with shrimp, pork, and chicken and instead got a soupy concoction with shrimp.</li><li>The upkeep is horrible, they might not have chicken, coleslaw, or any other damn thing you might find at a West Indian restaurant, but when they do, boy but when they do is it every delicious.</li><li>I keep going because when I can get the full combo ( chicken, coleslaw, and rice &amp; peas) it is delicious with some `` red sauce'' applied ...</li><li>Their coleslaw is fresh and compliments the sticky rice the chicken comes served on.</li><li>Three stars for $ 3 chicken.</li><li>$ 3 chicken is pretty much where it 's at.</li><li>I just close my eyes after I make my order leave my $ 3 on the table and hold my hands out until they hand me my styrofoam container of suspiciously delicious chicken.</li><li>The chicken fell off the bone and was delicious.</li><li>The chicken is decent, and they 're not cheap with what they give you, so I guess it 's worth the money.</li><li>Chicken was moist and well seasoned with a good amount of heat.</li><li>I love their jerk pork and chicken but the staff fits the name of the establishment, jerk.</li><li>A few reasons to love Mr. Jerk- great flavor- great prices ( chicken and pork combo for 10 $ that 's good enough for 2 people)- great sides ( plantains, coleslaw, and chili all mesh well together)- large servings- gravy and rice are awesome I always order take-out and the worst part of the experience is the drive home hungry while the aroma of the grilled chicken fills the car.</li><li>Chicken was extremely dry.</li><li>I tried some of the curry chicken and the chicken was so tender and the gravy was thick too.</li><li>The chicken was well seasoned and the veggies were fresh and crunchy.</li><li>The BBQ menu was excellent bbq lamb, chicken and beef.</li><li>Friend and I ordered beef fried rice, chicken teriyaki, beef, chicken and avocado with spinach sushi.</li><li>The menu consists of shawarmas ( Lamb, chicken, beef), falafel, kebabs ( beef or chicken) in a pita or as a platter with salad, hummus, garlic sauce and rice or fries for the meat options.</li><li>The quality of the meat and chicken can be questionable sometimes tho.</li><li>Armenian kitchen is the best shawarma place in the city because their beef shawarma is very tender and fresh so is the chicken, not fatty at all.</li><li>The chicken was mouth-watering and of decent quality.</li><li>Over the years I 've had most things but my fave is the veggie combo with either chicken or beef.</li><li>My friend 's shawarma came with large pieces of white meat chicken, the chicken was slightly dry and not crispy on the outside ( as shawarma should be), but it did have a pretty good flavour.</li><li>The beef shawarma is very good as well, but I generally stick with the chicken.</li><li>All the meats, lamb, beef, chicken are very flavourful and tender.</li><li>The chicken was very good, they use breast meat instead of the usual leg meat most shawarma restaurants use.</li><li>The chicken was tender and really soaked up the curry well.</li><li>The chicken was tender but the potatoes were overcooked and mushy.</li><li>The chicken does n't feel like chicken, it is this overly soft meat dish, really kind of gross.</li><li>Chicken tasted weird, I 'd go as far as saying it was the worst chicken I 've ever had.</li><li>Chicken tasted weird, I 'd go as far as saying it was the worst chicken I 've ever had.</li><li>There were a ton of chicken, scallops, shrimp, squid, green peppers, and more.</li><li>Chicken Chow Mein- Noodles and sauce were good, chicken was nasty, Chinese broccoli was huge stalks, very little greens, and was practically raw.</li><li>Cantonese chow mein, turnip patties, fried squid, house congee, general tao 's chicken, snow pea leaf, gai lan/Chinese broccoli, beef and broccoli, roast pork, BBQ duck, fish maw soup, hot and sour soup, soft-shell crab fried rice, eel fried rice ...</li><li>The vegetables on top were too tough to eat ( clearly very old). when I bit into the chicken, the meat was still pink inside.</li><li>At least I did n't feel the presence of MSG and the chicken was still crispy.</li><li>The pork belly was so so, and the chicken although tender and good quality, does not mix well with the spicy sauce The service was good considering that this place only has 1 server running around for all tables. although language is a bit of a barrier the server was nice and accommodating and you can tell she cares when suggesting you how to properly bbq the meat.</li><li>The chicken was a little mediocre.</li><li>The kalbi ribs were very chewy and the chicken had a funky after taste.</li><li>They have pork, beef, chicken, short ribs, and pork belly marinated in Korean BBQ Marinade.</li><li>The special dish we ordered, which was also the most expensive for the night, was gampoongi which is fried pieces of breaded chicken in a sweet and sour sauce; kinda like Chinese sweet and sour pork in presentation.</li><li>A good balance of sweet and sour and chicken was achieved, though the breading was just a tad on the hard side.</li><li>We had 6 choices: pork belly, beef short ribs ( kalbi), chicken, spicy pork, pork and bulgogi.</li><li>I like the chicken here better than Chingu.</li><li>1.) no parking 2.) the chicken in our noodle tasted like they cooked last week and reheated ( awful) 3.) overpriced, you have to add many toppings because the one pan does n't come with anything.</li><li>I loved their schmorgashboard of ramen, cheese, chicken, rice sticks and sweet potato in one dish!</li><li>We shared three portions of DakGalBee with noodles, chicken, cheese and kimchi between 4 people.</li><li>Love the chicken and seafood rice cakes with added cheese and ramen.</li><li>Also the chicken was bland.</li><li>I 'm pretty sure it was not marinated, but rather raw chicken cooked first, then sauce added on top.</li><li>We pondered over JS2 and JS3, but looking at the reviews ( they have free wifi!) and how the chicken was so popular, we went with JS2.</li><li>The chicken came fast, but it took a really long time for the cheese and noodles to arrive.</li><li>The waitresses helped mix the chicken with the cheese and noodles, however she had to bring the cooking table away from us as our table was too small.</li><li>The chicken was nothing special, though the cheese did help the 2-portion meal be a bit more filling.</li><li>The chicken and the cabbage though ?</li><li>This option had chicken, mussels, cabbage, squid and shrimp mixed in.</li><li>I recommend getting the Seafood Dakgalbee, which comes with chicken ( boneless dark meat), assorted seafood ( baby octopus, shrimp, mussels), and cabbage.</li><li>The $ 9.25 is the basic which includes the chicken, sauce, and some veggies.</li><li>My only disappointment was that they would n't mix the rice in with the chicken, the way it 's supposed to be!</li><li>For the Dak Gal Bi, the chicken, cabbage and base are very flavourful.</li><li>We ordered the Dak Gal Bee with chicken to share, and thought there was limited chicken and noodles and a lot more vegetables.</li><li>I always get it with the regular level spicy ( + rice cakes, noodles and mozzarella cheese) I would recommend asking them to put less vegetables ( they always put a lot and less chicken).</li><li>Some kinda stir-fried spicy chicken.</li><li>The chicken was really juicy and nicely grilled.</li><li>It was very tasty and was filled to the top of the bowl with with noodles and veggies, cant forget the chicken too!</li><li>A fajita wrap filled with succulent chicken, spinach, goat cheese, and grilled onions makes for a one-of-a-kind dish.</li><li>Seemed like the chicken was slowly grilled or was at least marinating in the balsamic because just one bite had a burst of flavour.</li><li>The chicken was seasoned well and paired well with the carbonerra ( bacon).</li><li>I typically order the gam ja tang and also dukboki or spicy chicken.</li><li>The chicken soup/stock has great flavour, It feels homey and I always think this must be so warming and soothing to eat when you are sick.</li><li>The chicken were very crispy and it was very close to how it tastes back in Korea.</li><li>Food: 4/5, crispy chicken and well sauced.</li><li>Just the other yelper it is a pub that serves good chicken.</li><li>We got a large order of green onion fried chicken ( with bones), and a small order of crispy chicken ( for size comparison) A plate of side-dishes and a hot plate of corn came out as we waited for the chicken.</li><li>The chicken itself had extra batter and was n't drenched over it, which I suppose is what makes it `` more crispy'' than the other offerings.</li><li>But anyway, I really like their green onion chicken and most of the other sauces go well with the chicken too!</li><li>Chicken was delicious.</li><li>I 've only had Korean fried chicken a couple of times so I am in no way an expert, but I was happy with my order and how crispy the chicken was.</li><li>Their chicken was ok- nothing special and not worth the hype.</li><li>The chicken was well cooked, batter was crisp, and it was n't too greasy.</li><li>The chicken is delicious and comes in a cute take out box which include pickled radishes and a drink.</li><li>The chicken is really good, a decent place for friends gathering and casual night out.</li><li>The chicken came hot and quickly, service was great overall.</li><li>Since I did n't order, I do n't know what most of the chicken was called, but none were that special.</li><li>It tasted maybe a bit better than your traditional popeyes chicken or KFC chicken, but really stoodout and made me want to go back was the garlic fries.</li><li>The Fry on the chicken is good and crispy.</li><li>The chicken was ridiculously good and I could eat their garlic butter fries forever!</li><li>They also fry different parts of the chicken, breasts, thighs, wings and cut them up into small pieces so it 's easy to eat.</li><li>Anyone can throw a fancy sauce on top of chicken and have it taste good.</li><li>Koreans really know how to fry their chicken!</li><li>Their hot chicken is very spicy and tangy, making it hard to taste the chicken.</li><li>My go to is half crispy chicken ( not the usual classic fried one) &amp; half spicy fried chicken.</li><li>Overall their chicken is crispy and flavoured.</li><li>At least the chicken was pretty good!</li><li>With most food groups) ... you can go across the street to M2M and get some Korean side dishes and maybe some type of bun or roll to get with the chicken.</li><li>The chicken here is pretty good.</li><li>The overall texure of the chicken was nice, with crispy breading and tender chicken.</li><li>The overall texure of the chicken was nice, with crispy breading and tender chicken.</li><li>I asked for Jerk sauce on top of the chicken and Oxtail sauce on the side and then I realized the cashier charged me a $ 0.20 fee for this request without letting me know.</li><li>2) Chicken magically both smells &amp; tastes of old fish.</li><li>The chicken was delicious too.</li><li>My table also sampled brownie crepe, chicken, ham, and tropical fruit waffle.</li><li>We also got 2 savoury crepes- 1 chicken, spinach &amp; cheese mushroom and 1 frankfurter spinach cheese.</li><li>I do n't know what kind of chicken they used but it was far from being the texture of chicken.</li><li>Seemed more like soggy chicken flavoured tofu.</li><li>Chicken was a tad dry.</li><li>The chicken is great, very tender and nicely spiced.</li><li>First of all, it 's nothing like Mr. Jerk or Caribbean island foods, jerk chicken is so tender and the flavours are not over powering the taste of the actual chicken.</li><li>First of all, it 's nothing like Mr. Jerk or Caribbean island foods, jerk chicken is so tender and the flavours are not over powering the taste of the actual chicken.</li><li>The chicken is n't the only star in the meal, the rice and coleslaw provides the same amount of attention.</li><li>3) The chicken did n't taste like authentic Jamaican jerk.</li><li>The gravy on the chicken was nice and spicy!</li><li>However the oven taste was very well as the chicken was tender.</li><li>-Omelet w/ham 4/10 tasted microwaved, not many choices for toppings, could n't substitute the bun with something else- Chicken Noodle Soup 7/10 Average, tasted out of a can- Turkey Bacon Wrap 2/10 Horrible, if I was n't as hungry as I was I would of givien it 0/10.</li><li>The chicken, biscuit and fries was fresh.</li><li>The chicken is never fresh.</li><li>Order of two pieces of chicken took 10 minutes and I was next in line.</li><li>My friend counted at most 5-6 little pieces of chicken in the dish while it was predominantly just the noodles, with a few pieces of vegetables.</li><li>I ordered the spicy chicken teriyaki lunch box ( lunch boxes are available from 11am-3pm) which came with meso soup, few maki rolls, rice, salad, and few pieces of fruits ( check the photo below) teriyaki chicken tasted A-OK.</li><li>I ordered the Mexican Roll ( chicken, green and red peppers) and the Dynamite Roll.</li><li>The chicken in this dish was cubed white meat with no seasoning and utterly flavorless.</li><li>Some faves include the prime rib, crab legs ( cold better than hot), spicy chicken, bbq pork ribs, wings, dimsum, fried fish w Tartar, scallop cutlets, the hot waffles with strawberries and whipped cream, the macaroons, and the creme brulee for dessert.</li><li>I was n't as impressed with the cooked food- kalbi was quite oily and chicken was just okay.</li><li>When I got home, the chicken was rubbery, the sushi not fresh, only 3 chopsticks when I clearly informed him we were six people, only one small container of soya sauce.</li><li>I usually love their food especially their chicken on the rocks but on my recent visit they gave me really dry chicken and rice.</li><li>I usually love their food especially their chicken on the rocks but on my recent visit they gave me really dry chicken and rice.</li><li>Teriyaki shrimp and chicken was excellent.</li><li>Teppanyaki Ume ( see picture) is a very good full lunch which includes soup, salad, shrimp appetizer, rice, veggies, chicken and steak.</li><li>It was a special that requires a group of 8, everyone got a few maki/sushi rolls, a bowl of salad, miso soup, fried rice, a shrimp, a scallop, chicken, mixed veggies, salmon and steak.</li><li>We had the chicken, steak and scallop meals.</li><li>Then you pick your meat ( chicken, beef, pulled pork, pulled beef, fish and shrimp) and toppings ( four salsas, cheese, beans, sour cream, lettuce).</li><li>I would recommend the pulled steak ( second would be the pulled pork followed by chicken and shrimp- both chicken and shrimp are a little bland from my experience- I have yet to try the fish).</li><li>I would recommend the pulled steak ( second would be the pulled pork followed by chicken and shrimp- both chicken and shrimp are a little bland from my experience- I have yet to try the fish).</li><li>Also, the General Tso 's chicken was a bit chewy.</li><li>If our order was correct and the chicken was n't chewy, I definitely would have given 5 stars.</li><li>Sandwiches, pizza, made to order, salads, chicken, fish, rice balls, espressos and a full bar.</li><li>You can get salad, wraps, chicken, etc.</li><li>The chicken was cooked to perfection and was n't overly spicy but had a nice heat to it.</li><li>As for the food itself ... possibly one of the WORST foods I 've ever had in my life .. the chicken was pretty much ALL just bone chunks and the sauce was soo sticcky from sitting out in the open for so long and I could n't take it ... okay maybe their dessert will be better ?</li><li>Sat there for 30 minutes waiting for her to basically warm up already cooked pasta, in a sauce that is already made, with chicken that is already cooked and mix it in with veggies that need to be sauteed.</li><li>Prices are outrageous, staff are rude, except for nice hostesses, and best food is the squash soup, chicken and Caesar salads.</li><li>I had the Chicken Quesadilla today and that blew my tastebuds off my tongue!</li><li>Problem was, the meal was almost all onions and green peppers with very little actual chicken.</li><li>She essentially ordered the Korean version of Chicken Noodle Soup.</li><li>About 25 minutes later the order arrived ... four small pieces of white meat and a lot of fries piping hot ( the fries that is, not the chicken).</li><li>The ginger and chicken fried rice also had egg whites and was a pleasant surprise- the ginger bits gave a refreshing kick and the chicken and egg made it a hearty comfort food style fried rice.</li><li>Chicken was tender and flavourful.</li><li>Dishes like the general tao 's chicken and chicken wings are pretty Western, but were still pretty good.</li><li>I liked how nicely crisp the chicken is for both dishes, but general tao 's is never spicy at any of these places!</li><li>For the chicken, the sauce was really nice, tomatoe-y but not too heavy.</li><li>The piece of chicken was thinly breaded, more meat to breading and the piece of meat was huge.</li><li>Friends tried their chicken, sausage and steak, but I believe veal is the best choice here.</li><li>The bread they used were harder than usual and the chicken were super dry.</li><li>Both were tasty, but my friend and I preferred the chicken.</li><li>Big hunks of extremely flavourful chicken, tasty rice, a pita and tzatziki sauce.</li><li>A place like this is the perfect place to come when you want some good chicken.</li><li>I like the seasoning on the chicken.</li><li>Chicken was moist even though it was rotisserie.</li><li>The chicken came already cooked with the vegetables and all we did was stir it occasionally for it not to burn.</li><li>The menu says they have chicken, pork or beef bibimbap but that 's a lie.</li><li>I mentioned a couple of times that they never seem to have chicken but never got a straight answer.</li><li>The chicken is perfectly grilled with lots of sauce and is accompanied by delicious roasted potatoes, salad ( I ca n't get enough of this dressing!), their amazing glass noodles, rice and miso soup.</li><li>Had the chicken shawarma box with potato wedges, not bad but the chicken was a little dry.</li><li>The chicken was moist and juicy with a fresh tasting BBQ sauce.</li><li>I ordered a shawarma plate and in my opinion the chicken was dry.</li><li>Chicken was dry, very busy place.</li><li>The chicken was moist and the batter was still crispy when served.</li><li>Excellent quality meat kabobs such as chicken, veal, beef.</li><li>Then ordered a variety of shish kabob styled meats that were freshly cooked in an oven behind the counter: lamb, ground beef, veal, chicken.</li><li>The chicken was nice and juicy.</li><li>Nasi Goreng for $ 7 is my goto lunch dish, which is Malaysian fried rice, chicken, shrimp, tomatoes, onion and a side of peanut sauce.</li><li>Ca n't go wrong with the chicken.</li><li>Anyway, there are heaps of other Portuguese chicken places that have more delicious chicken and friendlier service.</li><li>Finally I get home and when i opened the container I was disappointed that they gave me rice instead of the vegetables that I had ordered but I soon forgot all about this as i started in on the chicken.</li><li>The chicken was so well seasoned and moist and it had that wonderful BBQ rotisserie char taste by far one of the best Portuguese chickens i have had in a long time.</li><li>Good chicken, it 's always made to order.</li><li>Besides chicken they also offer other Portuguese cuisine.</li><li>One star for the chicken, one star for the hot sauce.</li><li>Found this place very close to my work. superb food and smiling customer service all around. tried their chicken, cod fish and salmon and all of them were just perfect.</li><li>The chicken is some of the best Portuguese chicken I 've had.</li><li>The only problem is that occasionally ( 1 out of 5) the chicken is dry and tastes old.</li><li>1 table long of selection ranging from breaded shrimp, goat curry, noodles, fried rice, chicken wings, sweet and sour chicken, vegetable spring rolls, Bbq chicken and watermelon.</li><li>The chicken was okay but lacked a lot of flavour.</li><li>Salad, Soup Teppanyaki main plate that consists of Chicken, Beef, Scallops, Zucchini, Onions and mushrooms with a single scoop of ice cream to finish the dinner.</li><li>Steak was OK chicken was white meat and even though advertised as fresh I doubt it was organic as it was bland.</li><li>Usually order the Chicken Pad Thai ( noodles, tofu, chicken, a sprinkling of green onions and a pack of ground peanuts on the side), Spring Rolls ( 2, with sauce) and/or the Ginger Chicken ( stuffed with chicken and different mushrooms, a few red peppers and a flavorful sauce).</li><li>The chicken was very tender, and it was filling.</li><li>My husband and I had ordered chicken and meat loaf on Thursday I think from the dinner for two menu and it was absolutely delicious ... however the regular menu we ordered from at our last visit was very dissapointing!</li><li>This location is not as convenient as their other locations if you are driving but perfect if you are using public transit as it is close to North York Station. stopped in this place for some apps and cake and we ended up with stomach aches. the whole experience was a dissapointment. we had clamari which was rubbery and a small portion. i am a huge calamari fan and this dish was a huge dissapointment. i have had calamari at the brampton symposium many times and loved it everytime. we also had a pita bread pizza type bread with gouda and chicken. the gouda was shredded and sparring. the chicken lacked flavour and fell off the pita with each bite due to lack of cheese to meld it all together. the cheescake was ok. it was extremely soft, nearly a mouse texture and it lacked the delicious graham cracker bottom which is my fav part of cheesecake. the chocolate caramel cake was also a mousse like texture. the caramel was drizzled on top and was eaten in two bites by my 4 year old. the cake lacked any other caramel flavour. it was a large piece and most of it was left behind. i ordered a steamed milk to go with the cake and they forgot to serve it. one star is generous for this place. i would give it a zero if i could.</li><li>I tried their Chicken Parmesan Sandwich with a side of fries.</li><li>Ordered from the date night menu ... not very impressed .. the chicken was very dry had a gross olive paste smothered on it .. the rice was littered with salt and the plate was soaked in soya sauce ..</li><li>Good:- Our server was attentive and pleasant, great job- Salad was reasonably fresh- Fries were pretty good Okay:- Wings were passable, certainly not `` best in the city'' as stated on the menu Bad:- Ribs ... like other reviews noted I 'm pretty sure they 're boiled, not smoked ... perhaps thrown into some sort of smoker briefly after they 're cooked but certainly not smoked over a long period of time, which is disappointing for a place with `` smoke house'' in its name- The chicken was dry and had very little taste, also not at all `` smoked'' like it says on the menu- The `` pulled pork'' was just ... wrong.</li><li>The chicken tastes more or less like what you 'd expect grilled chicken to taste.</li><li>The chicken is the only thing that seems like the right size.</li><li>If you have a groupon and is afraid of shrinkage, get the CHICKEN.</li><li>1/4 or 1/2 chicken will generally be the same size.</li><li>Beer makes me happy. this was ok --- SUMMARY --- Plus 's: good place to hang out, decent food, Minus 's: sitting on the patio means breathing all the car exhaust from the cars on Yonge street --- MORE DETAILS --- we choose a platter for two ... it consisted of: very tender chicken ( i picked it up and a piece of meat fell off- SO TENDER) first time i had cornbread- it looked burnt on the bottom, so i just ate the top part not bad ( it would n't ' be my first choice) pulled pork was ok chicken wings were fairly good beef brisket was pretty good .. ribs were kinda dry ... in the end everything kinda tasted the same. fries were good- not too salty. stepping in, the restaurant itself is nice, there are booths or table seating indoors. the main window is a garage front that opens into the patio area facing yonge st. interior has exposed beam ceilings and there 's many nostalgic memorabilia decorated throughout. we ordered a couple of things from the menu 1. spaghetti with beef brisket- yeah i know an experimental dish but i was feeling like spaghetti and if the brisket was good -- you know that would been amazing. unfortunately the brisket was covered in tomato sauce so I could n't taste it in it 's full glory or not ..</li><li>Grilled Chicken salad was horrible, cold chicken, more like deli-style chicken.</li><li>Boiled tips were just gross, the brisket was a dry tasteless piece of leather, the chicken was from a steamer type cooker the skin was soft and rubbery, the pulled pork was hands down the worst pulled pork I have ever had!</li><li>But have to say Pearl did a good job in this dish, the chicken was very tender and juicy, not as strong as port but definitely very tasty.</li><li>The chicken is tender and nothing too special.</li><li>The flavor was perfect, and the chicken was cooked perfectly to tenderness.</li><li>The chicken was a bit small but the rest of the ingredients meshed together still made for a pretty good sandwich.</li><li>Like most pubs, they do n't marinate their chicken.</li><li>The chicken was good quality especially for a restaurant of 1.5 star calibre as it says on Yelp.</li><li>For a club it was more than I expected from a diner because the chicken was actual chicken breast and not deli meat.</li><li>The chicken, although it did come grilled, still had a different texture than I 'm used to but the flavour was definitely there.</li><li>They have lamb, chicken, pork &amp; beef.</li><li>Shrimp, chicken, beef, tofu, you name it- they can grill it.</li><li>It was crazy good and unlike congee from some places that may use the parts of the chicken rejected by KFC, this place uses primo meat!</li><li>I love their pan friend turnip cakes ( they are diced then fried with chicken, chili 's, egg) so awesome!</li><li>The meal included the Super Bowl congee, half crispy chicken, chinese donut in noodle roll, deep fried shrimp dumpling!</li><li>However, I do appreciate that their food is not too oily or salty!- other pros: LARGE portions, large variety of congee and noodles, friendly staff- con: can become very crowded: ( side dishes I 've tried and liked: tofu and garoupa, house special chicken, mushroom and beef, tofu and mixed veggie congees I 've tried and liked: mixed vegetable and sweetcorn, sweetcorn and beancurd. congees I 've tried and disliked: sliced fish congee tastes bland ....</li><li>Not a fan but there were tons of shrimp, chicken, egg and tofu in it and I mean, tons of shrimp.</li><li>The chicken Marsala was good, but the chicken could have been pounded.</li><li>Only exception would be the actual chicken was a little bit dry, but the sauce was amazing especially with the Garlic Nan.</li><li>But maybe that 's how all butter chicken looked, I certainly did n't know any better.</li><li>Is it butter chicken, or buttered chicken ?</li><li>My Chicken Curry came in something that resembled a butter globe with the lid removed with a contraption that held the dollar store candle beneath it.</li><li>The Chicken was dry, and I could n't really taste the curry in the sauce.</li><li>The flaky sauce paired fine with my rice, but the dry chicken was what ruined it.</li><li>The butter ( ed) chicken was not dry, but it was n't tender either.</li><li>There are two carts filled with several types of curries, veges, chicken, desserts.</li><li>Just PLAIN pieces of chicken, which is not what you go to an Indian restaurant for !!!</li><li>The Chicken was flavourless and the sauce tasted like something I could buy in a bottle in a grocery store.</li><li>I am impressed with everything they have, the rice, thin slices of potatoes, the chicken, but most of all the lamb.</li><li>The menu is quite extensive and offers all kinds of meats like Chicken, Beef, Lamb and even seafood platters.</li><li>The flavour on the chicken is amazing, moist and grilled to a perfection.</li><li>- I was very pleased with how clean it all was -- there was literally no mess, no sauce leaked out anywhere ... contrast that to some subs from Quiznos, which while good, have been known to fall apart completely ( pieces of chicken or various veggies falling out -- it has happened to me countless times) ( We knew it was CASH ONLY, but I 'm gonna add that here again just for others to note) As a side note, the prices quoted on their website are n't the same as in stores -- in fact, the in-store prices at this location were LOWER than the website 's PDF, across the board!</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
