<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 84' %><h2>bill<br />occurrence: 96</h2><div><ol><li>After waiting again, we walked through the restaurant to find the waitress to request the bill.</li><li>Our bill was $ 8 flat.</li><li>Dropped a $ 10 and walked off completely satisfied with the fact that I had fed my gf and I with one bill.</li><li>Staff is friendly and they 're great about splitting the bill.</li><li>Service was fairly good but when we were almost finish eating, all the employees were also eating their lunch and it took some time to get the bill.</li><li>The groupon does not apply to any specials ( AYCE, sushi deals, bubble tea, etc), and they tried to make us pay in cash when we got the bill.</li><li>I can overlook poor English, poor food and an unreasonable bill, but not this rude, inexcusable behaviour and poor customer service.</li><li>Upon consuming the one pitcher of beer and devouring the 2lbs of wings and fries, we were approached by a server in regards to the bill, and we mutually relayed the notion of splitting the bill- the price of the pitcher would be covered by my colleague, and I would pay for the 2lbs of wings + fries.</li><li>I still have the receipt and bill saved to verify the date/time my colleague and I were present, and I am more than willing to sit down with the manager and owner of this sub-par restaurant.</li><li>When trying to leave ( we left about an hour after the game, so it was pretty empty) it took about half an hour to get the bill.</li><li>Overall service was really bad, we had to call another waitress to get our bill.</li><li>Miku has nothing on Sushi Moto .... except about a 50% larger bill.</li><li>I would come here for the drinks next time because they 're very reasonably priced: Amaretto Sour- $ 4.86 Gin and Tonic- $ 4.86 I did NOT like that there was a mandatory 15% gratuity charged on our bill.</li><li>The bill was given to us while we were still eating because they were getting ready to clean up and close.</li><li>Also the waitress took away our service button once we ordered so there was no way for us to get their attention for water or get out bill.</li><li>It took quite a while to get another server to attend to us and finally get us our bill.</li><li>Never thought to discount the bill.</li><li>The bill took a long time in coming .... longer than it took for the food to arrive ...</li><li>Never checked on us once after we got our meals, she actually only came by to collect our plates and only said thank you and you 're welcome at the end when we asked for our bill because she thought her tip was coming.</li><li>When the waitress brought us the bill she forgot the 15% coupon, but she apologized politely and corrected the mistake.</li><li>He was pretty blase the rest of the time we were there, and shortly after coming by to check in on our desserts ( we were n't even half done), he proceeded to leave us with the bill.</li><li>Once we had overcharged for 3 bucks on a $ 15 bill but we were almost by the the house when we noticed .the next time they were trying over charge us by 7 dollars on a 20 dollars bill.</li><li>Nandos has the same ordering system and it has over 1000 restaurants in over 30 countries. ( it obviously works) I prefer ordering this way, no waiting for the bill when your ready to leave you.</li><li>The bill was $ 19 and some cents.</li><li>They do not accept debit, so we decided to split the bill with credit cards.</li><li>And in the end they gave us wrong bill!</li><li>I was the only one in the restaurant by the time I finished, no one came with the bill ( but I was sitting in an enclosed area) so i called the waitress over and got the bill.</li><li>What I mean is, they are here to just serve you food and clean your table and hand you the bill.</li><li>It took a long time to get the bill and the waiter practically grunted at me to move over so he could clear my plate.</li><li>This place gets packed quite early with young Koreans, probably York students, Also it 's Korean table service rules which means it 's not considered impolite to flag down your waitress when you want service or the bill.</li><li>The portions are BIG, just the way I like it, and the bill was pretty decent- I think for all that between 5 people we paid around $ 65.</li><li>Took 30 minutes to get the bill.</li><li>The manager then told us that if we did n't need anything else, that he would get our bill and asked if we were paying by card, basically ushering us out.</li><li>- Server was nice and knew his stuff, but having to look for him just to get the bill was kind of ... annoying.</li><li>Everything on the menu was decently priced ( our bill was under $ 20 for two people), and the service was attentive enough.</li><li>I wish we had a ringer in the booth we were sitting in because it was hard to flag down our server to get the bill.</li><li>We realize we had just paid for someone else 's bill.</li><li>After our meal was finished, Mr. Manager gave us the bill, charging for everything we ordered at full price; again, no apology given at this time.</li><li>The waitress took away our dessert plates and promptly brought our bill, which we found rude since we wanted to talk for a few minutes.</li><li>Price- right, so when I get the bill I remember why I do n't come here more.</li><li>The bill I received at The Lobster Trap was hand written in scribbles and it was difficult understanding what it said so I had to ask the server couple times just to make sure.</li><li>The bill is $ 100 for 2.</li><li>Good prices too, our bill for two dishes and app come in just over $ 20.</li><li>Also a note, do n't order any drink that needs to be made ( Ovaltine, Horlicks, smoothie, etc) unless you feel like receiving it AFTER you get the bill.</li><li>They tacked a standard 15% gratuity on our bill, which they did n't deserve.</li><li>It took forever to get the bill at the end of the meal.</li><li>We walked up to the counter to pay after waiting half an hour for him to show up and bring us our bill.</li><li>It also took us a really long time to get the bill.</li><li>Then the server did n't come to check up on us until later where we needed the bill ...</li><li>So we just simply got fed up after a while of waiting and decided to get the bill.</li><li>Nothing too special overall ... prices were fair i suppose but make sure you check your bill- they calculated my bill wrong twice and then after finally getting the bill right, they gave me back way less change than what it should 've been ... if they had n't do n't that I would 've given them 3 stars.</li><li>Although I think I was charged more because maybe I was foreign since I was charged $ 15.75 ( tax included) but the lunch menu said it was $ 11-12.99 ish, so make sure you check the bill.</li><li>Total bill was about 20 $.</li><li>Long story short: Service took a long time, one of the girls acknowledged my raised hand but never came back to help me get the bill.</li><li>My friend paid with credit card, and our server was more than happy to entertain my request to break a $ 50 bill.</li><li>But because of the lack of honesty with the bill, lazy service and small portions, I have no option other than suggest you stay away from this place.</li><li>The bill surprised me since the `` original'' price of the meal would have been 60ish.</li><li>We even had a different waitress bring our bill because the sorry-ass waitress that took our order did n't even bother to come back.</li><li>They finally took our order, rolled their eyes at the baby again and then never returned except to give us the bill.</li><li>We sat waiting after we finished our meal, even going as far as stacking our plates to indicate we had long since finished when we realized they likely were n't going to be bringing us our bill and time soon and we would have to go to the front to pay.</li><li>One of these quirks include the fact that they do not allow you to split the bill ( one bill per table) and I 'm not sure why this is the case.</li><li>They have a new `` house'' rule, one bill, no splitting, which we found was very odd but I paid the bill and it was a fair amount for the food we got.</li><li>Service was ok, but they do n't allow splitting the bill and no credit card below $ 20 i believe.</li><li>Took a while to get the servers attention when we wanted to get a refill or the bill.</li><li>Then when I got the bill I was charged $ 1.99 for the tiny cup of slaw, seriously ???</li><li>It was like 8 cents worth, but whatever, I just paid the bill.</li><li>They 've also implemented a table service system with a tabletop device with buttons indicating if you need service, want to order, or want the bill.</li><li>Though it was a busy night it.does not excuse them throwing down our menus and bill.</li><li>It took so long for the server to come back and ask about another drink or the bill, that I had to actually get up and go to the counter and ask if I could receive the bill.</li><li>It took us a while to get our bill, and the staff apologized for the wait.</li><li>Large portions, small bill, that fits me just fine.</li><li>When we finished our meals, it also took forever and a day to get our bill.</li><li>Everyone tipped though, but according to the worker we had not tipped 10% of the total bill and demanded more money.</li><li>They did not even come to us at the table to give us the bill.</li><li>That only took forever, as well as 5 people to do the bill.</li><li>The bill was paid and the chef came out and had words with the party that paid our bill.</li><li>The bill was paid and the chef came out and had words with the party that paid our bill.</li><li>Orders that never came and we waited for 20 minutes just to get the bill.</li><li>-Sometimes it takes forever to get the bill.</li><li>When we got our bill we are suprised to find that the tea cost $ 3 per person ( which 4 us comes to $ 12 for the whole pot!), which is rather expensive!</li><li>Took a while to just get water, he seemed apathetic, and could n't even wave him down to get the bill ...</li><li>We waited very long to get our food, very long to get coffee refills, and very long to get our bill.</li><li>- Biggest pet peeve: waited 10 minutes to get the bill, then even longer to pay.</li><li>After Groupon (- $ 40), our bill was still $ 60.</li><li>There was no approach and I did n't even know her name until I got the bill.</li><li>At that point I just told him to get us our bill because we were in no mood for eating after this treatment and I was n't going to pay for the food they took away from us and that we did n't eat.</li><li>They pretty much handed us our bill in the middle of a conversation we were having and as soon as we paid our bill, they stopped all their service altogether.</li><li>But I 'm the end when it came to getting the bill.</li><li>The bill was $ 64 something we gave $ 90 in cash, hoping to get some change in order to split the bill between us.</li><li>The bill was $ 64 something we gave $ 90 in cash, hoping to get some change in order to split the bill between us.</li><li>Our bill was $ 95.99 and we paid $ 100 out of courtesy.</li><li>However, there was one lady server that had better English and helped us correct our bill when it was wrong.</li><li>We were so pissed, we left them $ 96 on a $ 95.89 bill and left with the waitresses eyes glaring at us in disbelief.</li><li>Our bill was brought over as soon as we asked for it ( which seems trite but all too often we 've been at hipster or fine dining places where it all falls apart at the end of service!).</li><li>We had to flag him down to get the bill.</li><li>Not bad if you 're looking to stuff yourself with Indian food with a bunch of co-workers and then split the bill evenly ..</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
