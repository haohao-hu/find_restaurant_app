<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1563' %><h2>deep fried squid tentacles<br />occurrence: 2</h2><div><ol><li>It was not great but awful.- clear skin chive and shrimp dimpling: okay. no complaint here.- black bean spare ribs: extremely salty but very tasty- deep fried squid tentacles: it did n't taste all the fresh because the whole thing was just not al dente enough. it should be less chewy and more rubbery. flavour was okay- garlic baby bok choy: a `` Special'' dish that was over $ 5 with fairly small portion. it was done VERY well though. best dish probably- custard bun: way too much flour and the custard was not dense at all.- singapore vermicelli: good, no complaints Overall, the food was decent, not the greatest dimsum but it satiates the craving, any time of the day.</li><li>The food is good, but not worth the teeny portion size they give you. ... while i 've always known this place existed, it 's hard for me to remember that it 's there to try it out. located in a plaza on don mills but you ca n't really see the storefront and if you 're not looking for it you 'll drive by it completely. finally we got dinner takeout as we were searching on yelp. we ordered: live whole lobster with efu noodles- excellent. yeung chow fried rice- good, but the peas were slightly undercooked. sweet cruller rice noodle rolls, good. stir fried beef with vegetables, good. deep fried squid tentacles, good. fried turnip patties Singapore style, mediocre. sweet and sour pork, excellent. the food was great, the prices are definitely cheaper than congee queen. all of that for $ 70, and they deliver for orders over $ 25- which i did n't know until we picked up the food. love delivery, especially for the winter- will definitely return!</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
