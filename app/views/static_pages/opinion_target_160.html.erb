<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 160' %><h2>water<br />occurrence: 41</h2><div><ol><li>The pitcher that held the water was once clear, but turned yellow.</li><li>We were immediately served with tea, water and etc ... they are on top of things ...</li><li>Water was scarce as we had to beg for a refill and Louise seemed irritated the whole time.</li><li>I usually find complaints towards general service inadequacies to be petty attempts at a more sophisticated restaurant review, but it literally took me more than 4 requests to two different servers including my own to have my water filled just once, and the overabundance of sodium in the dishes did n't help much either.</li><li>We would never expect to be seated for over 20 minutes without anyone so much as offering us water.</li><li>Spaghetti- portion smaller than i expected 4 jumbo shrimps that tasted very shrimpy, had an ocean water taste like it was not rinsed.</li><li>That 's called abuse, basically $ 5 for sugar and water.</li><li>The service has mainly been good, but slower on the patio where it can take longer to get a drink and you might have to ask more than once for water.</li><li>The water was warm, I guess ice water is extra.</li><li>Water is pre-poured ( germaphobes beware ?), and the bread basket, with olive spread, butter, olive oil and balsamic are also preset at the table.</li><li>Nothing stood out but I do have to give it up to them as they were always filling up the buffet dishes, water and there were never a shortage of any dish.</li><li>The only good thing is the consistency of the drink: not too thin/watery but not too thick/milky- too thick can be off-putting while too thin can make it feel like you 're drinking water than milk.</li><li>Two entr√©es, two desserts, one water, two sodas, and an appetizer ended up costing $ 71, plus a $ 25 tip ..</li><li>Service was impeccable- fresh ground pepper and fresh parmesan ready on standby, water refilled without even asking.</li><li>Our water glasses never saw empty and the waitress went unnoticed each time she came by our table to ensure they were bottomless.</li><li>The food also took a bit longer to get to us, but our water was always filled and people were always checking on us to make sure we were okay.</li><li>The amount of water they mixed in with the latte is ridiculous.</li><li>Staff are nice but very busy so if you ask for something ( more water, drinks etc) just keep reminding them ( yes I know that 's not good service is all about but they do n't mind) ..</li><li>They had those buttons on the side sign type of thing which u can press for the server, water, and any questions.</li><li>Also, the water was not even served until 10 minutes after we were seated and it smelled really strongly like chlorine !!! or some other chemical! like realllllly strong- we all could n't drink more than a few sips.</li><li>Water and tea refilled promptly.</li><li>Water was quick, but everything else including side dishes took forever.</li><li>Before it was delivered to portable, i saw a waitress pouring water in the dish and stirring it.</li><li>We had to ask million times for menu, tea, water, bill etc. we were very unhappy about the service and left a small tip.</li><li>We had to walk all the way to the back of the restaurant and asked for everything that we needed, table, water, food .... our server wasnt friendly and got some attitudes.</li><li>Where are my side dishes and water ?</li><li>How rude you should be to not bring side dishes and water ?</li><li>Service was excellent; coffee, tea, and water refills came often.</li><li>By the way, if you ever wonder why the waiter pour water in the rice stone after transferring the rice in the bowl, here 's the reason: like most non-korean people, we would think that they pour the water to easily clean the stone, but in fact, you should be eating it.</li><li>Cutlery, plus trays, and water is all self-service.</li><li>Service is minimal, basically give you what you need, the menu and water when you sit, chopsticks and bowls after you order.</li><li>Last time there, it was so bad that we did n't get the water, bowls, spoons and simple utensils requested.</li><li>My friend and I were sat, given one tea and one water.</li><li>Water was not served and had to be asked for.</li><li>Had to ask for the essentials; water, table setting, even wasabi and ginger ( which is essential for sushi restaurants ??).</li><li>The biggest problem for me is that the tea and water to taste like soap- either the teapot or the cups are not rinsed thoroughly ... this is extremely off putting and hard to ignore when evaluating any restaurant.</li><li>Hopefully they can address the slow service and soap-tasting water and tea.</li><li>The server was friendly in the beginning, coming back with side dishes and water.</li><li>I 'd say stick to beer, water or soda pop. Moving into the buffet portion of GHMG, I was really impressed with the organized lay out for food and the overall freshness and organization of the Mongolian BBQ area.</li><li>Who knew rice and water could be so tasty ?!</li><li>I asked for a cup of water without ice ( as I usually get brain freeze on ice), guess the server saw I brought my Advil with me, she brought me a cup of slightly warm water !!</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
