<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 509' %><h2>falafel balls<br />occurrence: 7</h2><div><ol><li>I also sample a perogie and a devoured the falafel balls.</li><li>TOVLI. luckily i work in this neck of the woods, otherwise it would be pretty heroic ( but SO worth it!) to come up here for lunch from downtown! there is another location just south of wilson on bathurst, but i think that 's it. i love falafels, and i think that TOVLI has the best in the city. and yes it 's those sexy falafel sandwiches that i adore ... the falafel balls alone are pretty fabulous, but the sandwiches rock! stuffed full of their salad ( a kind of coleslaw) and your choice of pickled turnips ( my favourite) and such, they are HUGE and wonderful. definitely not for first dates or for in the car, these require 2 hands, lots of napkins and a good appetite!</li><li>They also somehow allow them to bud in line. just had food from here this morning, last night, earlier in the day yesterday, just after a first breakfast yesterday morning and im hoping to polish off the remnants over the next couple of days. hows that for committed ? like all great middle eastern places, i only have them when i am north of eglinton. this is not a frequent occurrence, for good reason. however, when im there, i delight in their robust falafel balls that crunch on the outside and warm your mouth with the softness of a pillow on the inside. this holds true even when they are cold- except for the crunchy part, but NEVER are they dry like virtually all falafel places south of there. the salads are fresh, tasty, albeit a little oily- but i cant resist the eggplant salad even though its bathing in oil. the pita is the only kind i enjoy- a big circular pocket thats fluffy and fresh. the hummous and tehina are perfect in their consistency, and spice. the only thing that i dont like from this place, is when you go inside and order a falafel sandwich ... its gargantuan ... so much so that you have no idea how to approach it ... and you want to approach it ... its like a hot sexy big assed, big breasted, big lipped woman. ( not quite sure if that metaphor worked but, i gave it a go at least.).</li><li>If you eat a lot of falafels downtown you 're probably used to a few pre-cooked falafel balls wrapped up in a paper thin pita with a measly amount of toppings and only a splash of sauce.</li><li>For example, the Vegetable Combo Plate ( $ 12) only has 3 tiny falafel balls.</li><li>Delicious falafel balls, yummy salad and great selection of pizza slices.</li><li>They pack the pita generously with lots of falafel balls and different salads.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
