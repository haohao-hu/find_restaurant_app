<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 428' %><h2>mussel<br />occurrence: 9</h2><div><ol><li>Although I enjoyed my pot- I had the seafood version which came with scallop, sea cucumber, shrimp, and mussel, I 'm going to stick to their regular chicken soup next visit since I thought the amount of seafood given was not justified with the cost difference.</li><li>It has shrimps, cuttlefish, fish balls and even 1 fresh mussel.</li><li>The fried rice aside, for two portions of seafood dak gal bee, there was only 1 mussel.</li><li>Does this mean that each portion only gets 1/2 a mussel ?</li><li>Tonight I had 3 pieces of tiny, head and shell-on shrimp, one very large mussel, and lots of tofu.</li><li>Thirdly, i got the seafood soon tofu, and there were two dried out shrimp too hard to get off the shell, one mussel and a couple of small shrunken oysters.</li><li>Also, the combination tofu is described as having beef, shrimp and mussel ( sic) and as we joked, they were very accurate in their description.</li><li>My coworker and I spent the entire afternoon chugging down water to try and balance the amount of salt in the soup and kimchi We got 2x combination 1 ( $ 8.85), which had exactly 1 shrimp ( mini one) and 1 mussel, and maybe 2 bites of beef The bibimbap ( $ 11.51) had no beef ( we had to send t back to the kitchen) Awful experience, good service though I came here after trying the downtown location.</li><li>My boyfriend and I went here and I felt that we got this great deal on a shared meal that included:- a medium sized lobster cooked or as sashimi- tempura- rice x2- lamb rack- salmon filet- mussel soup x 2- salad x2 This entire meal would 've been around $ 60 altogether, which I think is a great deal!</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
