<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 7343' %><h2>two chicken wings<br />occurrence: 1</h2><div><ol><li>Now I would never complain about that ratio ... but here 's the kicker ( s): The breaded strips of chicken had a very odd, smoky flavour which after a hesitant second bite, revealed itself to be a strip of bacon wrapped around the chicken ( um, Jewish neighbourhood and no mention of it on the menu), the two chicken wings had a distinctive metallic flavour, the pork ribs were terribly chewy and dry, the shrimp had a mealy, thick dough around them that was n't even fully cooked through and had a terrible, raw-fish smell and taste that lingered in my mouth for an hour afterward and the chicken balls were ok.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
