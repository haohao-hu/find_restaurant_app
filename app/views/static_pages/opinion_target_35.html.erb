<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 35' %><h2>sauce<br />occurrence: 189</h2><div><ol><li>The ribs were dry, I think they were sitting out a while, but the meat was tender and like I said, the sauce was quite good.</li><li>I like the fried zucchini the most, the kimchi has a spicy-sweetness with a bit of sour, and the broccoli with the white salad dressing was the best. unfortunately the main was not as good anymore. the kalbijim was not tender at all, and there is n't any potato or radish with the stew. while sweet and sour pork tasted ok, but the sauce was a bit thick, and the batter too. the worst was the Kimchi fried rice, the potion was really small, almost no Kimchi in it, and it taste really sour, not in a good way. and the fried rice was n't hot, not spicy hot and not temperature hot, yet it just came out of the kitchen less than 5 minutes after we order it.</li><li>So many things wrong, nothing like the picture in the menu for one, rice not crunchy at all, no sauce, shrimp way over cooked and shrivelled.</li><li>The sauce was rich, its sweetness offset by both the sour plums and pickled leeks, the latter adding an extra bit of kick of contrast.</li><li>3.5 stars, Pretty comprehensive selection of West Indies/Caribbean food items, with an extra emphasis on every kind of sauce you can imagine.</li><li>The noodles came out 1st, and it was drenched in an overpowering sauce.</li><li>Surprisingly, the sauce was good though.</li><li>The pasta was homemade and fantastic though, and the sauce complemented the dish very well, but I had just enough for one of the two pieces.</li><li>The tomatoes were nice and juicy and the cheese was very tasty, the salad was perfect with just the right amount of sauce to salad ratio.</li><li>For the main course, I had Villetto alla Marsala ( veal scaloppine in a sweet marsala wine sauce) and this dish pushed a mute button on my chatty mouth for a full minute ( kinda made me nervous) as I chewed on the delectable juicy meat with this really mouthwatering sauce.</li><li>The sauce was a perfect complement to the bread, and the mussels were very fresh as promised by our server.</li><li>The sauce was really good so that made up for the mussels.</li><li>Mixed Green, Arugula Salad with Apple and Walnut- portion size is good but just a little too heavy on dressing and get a little soggy Gnocchi in Tomato Sauce Finished with Ricotta di Bufala- Gnocchi has this great chewy texture cooked al dente- the sauce was kind of generic, does remind me of something from the can ...</li><li>The pizza was okay but it was generally incohesive and the sauce and toppings were disheveled while the base was borderline frozen.</li><li>The sauce tasted like bottled Ragu and the ravioli I buy at Loblaws ( the PC brand) tastes better, The dessert however was excellent- chocolate/raspberry tartuffo.</li><li>The sauce was an olive oil and butter sauce with a hint of lemon.</li><li>The sauce tasted strongly of mayo, not sure what they were thinking there, and the `` home fries'' we 're not home fries at all, but boiled potatoes that had been half mashed and topped with paprika ..</li><li>The sauce is tasty with parmesan browned on the top.</li><li>A nice blended flavour throughout with a wonderful sauce!</li><li>Ginger Crispy Chicken, was pretty good although very sweet, very greasy and very salty House Special Rice, excellent Beef with Snow peas were ok, sauce was very thick, very salty Overall this is just not what I look for in terms of quality chinese food.</li><li>Really oily, and chewy, not tender and the sauce was salty, dark and strong.</li><li>It 's made with raw crabs ( usually smaller and soft-shelled) and marinated with either soy sauce or spicy sauce.</li><li>Ordered: Gae-Jang ( marinated raw crab) 2/5* Plate of marinated crab for $ 12.99* You can order soy sauce based or spicy sauce based* I ordered soy sauce based Gae Jang* Basically you get 2 small crabs all cracked up* Soy sauce marinade was decent but a little too sweet* What turned me off from this is how the crabs did n't taste very fresh* Although it is marinated, because you are eating this raw- freshness is quite important* My mouth felt a little dry/tough after eating this and it was n't very pleasant* The claw part was n't cracked and there was no way I could break it with my teeth* I was quite disappointed with this dish since I was looking forward to it Ordered: CheolPan JjooGgooMi ( baby squid stir fry) 5/5* Baby squid stir fried with vegetables and ricecake for two people at $ 19.99* This was recommended by my friend who 's had it before* It 's meant for 2 people and cooked at your table* This is very spicy ( be aware !!)* It came with lots of baby squid, ricecakes and vegetables* Sauce was very intense in flavor ( spices) and it was good to eat with rice* I thought it was kind of odd how they had broccoli in it* I loved this dish and would go back just for it Complimentary: Kong Bi Ji* This is a grinded up bean paste that people like to eat with the rice* I am not a big fan of beans .... or grinded up beans so I did n't really enjoy it* But my friend said it was really good!</li><li>-YangNyeom GeJang ( Raw crabs marinated with hot spicy sauce)- $ 14.99 Unlike the ganjan gejang, the crabs for YangNyeom are already opened and cut into pieces before being marinated for the sauce to coat and penetrate the crab meat.</li><li>The sauce eliminated the raw, fishy taste while enhancing the flavor of the fresh crabs at the same time.</li><li>The sauce was really really good.</li><li>With the sauce, I finished all my rice ( I usually do n't eat rice).</li><li>You can choose from hummus, hot sauce, tzatziki sauce or tahini sauce.</li><li>The entr√© was ok, but the sauce was heavy and a little salty compared to the other branch in downtown.</li><li>Nice crispy edges on the eggplant, the sauce is good but really oily.</li><li>The sauce was spicy and cooked just right, not too watery.</li><li>The sauce is tasty but not as flavourful as I was expecting.</li><li>The sauce was very flavorful with just the right amount of spice.</li><li>The noodles are overcooked and the sauce is subpar, but it satisfies the hunger when you are studying.</li><li>The sauce for the fries was really good and the burger was delicious.</li><li>The sauce was just right.</li><li>There were multiple pieces of mushroom was evident and the sauce was creamy but not too powerful.</li><li>OMG sooooo good: P The sauce was perfect! and the seafood in this dish did n't taste or smell too fishy.</li><li>I do n't expect much for $ 8 so I am not complaining- the chicken yakitori served steaming hot! fogging up my camera .. the sauce is a little sweet, but the chicken was nice and moist Kiyomizu seems to be really popular with the office workers in the area during lunch time, every tables were occupied by the time I left.</li><li>The sauce was decent as well.</li><li>Some places make it really dry and tasteless and you must add sauce to be palatable.</li><li>It looks like they made them, added sauce to them, and let them sit for a long time until they would be brought to us.</li><li>Shrimp was quite rubbery and the sauce was salty and lacked flavor.</li><li>The sauce was exquisite.</li><li>Had the following Calamari- Not too greasy, could be a bit crispier but thoroughly enjoyed it with the Cajun dip Tortilla and Dip- Tasty and refills of tortillas was offered by our server Ribs with Fries n Beans- Ribs were prepared quite good, fall off the bone, not too fatty, not too much muscle fibers, sauce was good, fries were crispy, bans were not mush, definitely recommended NY and Top Sirloin Steak was cooked proper to medium rare, for the price it had a decent depth of flavor, salad that came with it was pretty standard, veggies were cooked well, mashed potatoes was good, first time having the Peppercorn sauce not taste like burnt chocolate, bravo to the new kitchen staff Probably will come back but I 'll probably request Miranda as my server as there 's been too many servers that take their job for granted at this location.*** note they do n't validate parking anymore 2apps 3 entrees Above average gratuity Around $ 150 for 3 happy and full people Will come back to this location if I 'm having a craving for tender ribs.</li><li>Dry with very little sauce and very little meat.</li><li>The sauce was more sweet than tangy, and it did n't have an overpowering hoisin taste to it like it does at some restaurants.</li><li>The lamb shank is fall of the bone tender and the sauce is so flavourful.</li><li>Some other places ( like Jerk Kin) g might offer you more meat but the sauce is just on the skin.</li><li>For example, the chicago, Yoko, and spider rolls were only distinguished by the shrimp tempura, unagi, and the soft-shell crab respectively, but there was no way you could tell the difference when all you could taste was the sweetness of the sauce ( which was made even worse by the fact that the yam is also very very prominent and sweet.</li><li>We told the staff the sauce was overwhelming and the rolls were way too similar to each other but was told that customers wanted more sauce and that if they did n't want sauce to indicate when ordering, but there was no way to know this beforehand.</li><li>The sauce overpowered the beef taste.</li><li>The sauce was entirely too spicy and tasted like someone had been a little too generous with the pepper.</li><li>Over all, a nice place but if we come back, we 'll be sure to order something different next time! ok it 's no fluke the wood oven pizza here is very good. ( we ordered two kinds to try) the dough, sauce and cheese the base ingredients of most any pizza are top notch. the crust i would describe .. it 's not a thin where it 's paper thin and it 's not cooked crisp like I 've had at many other thin crust pizza places. having its so crisp hides the true identity of the pizza dough. how can one taste the crust if it 's burnt !? the crust is thin where one can bite into the dough know it 's dough and not thick enough to not overwhelm the toppings. my quattro stagione was made wrong though .. it suppose to be separate quarters of pizza with the individual toppings. but instead it was a pizza with all the toppings. c 'mon just because I do n't look italian does n't mean I do n't know how it 's suppose to be. do n't give me stupid excuses that things get roughed up in the oven that why that make it that way ? i do n't care for the chatty waitress here and the ridiculous excuses, but as i mentioned in my first review. i will come here for the food because the cooks and chefs in the back know what they are doing ..</li><li>I could tell it had sat out for a bit, but I think it actually made it better because the sauce was absorbed fully and the cheese was all melty.</li><li>I was extremely hungry and back at the office, I was in my own little world as I bit into warm sauce, beans, lettuce, tomatos and chicken all-in-one-bite.</li><li>The sauce was obviously jarred tomato sauce with a handful of capers thrown in and nary a black olive in sight.</li><li>While the food was very fresh and tasty, the lack of sauce made the meal a tad dry.</li><li>Despite the cold meat, the sauce in the shawarma really stood out.</li><li>Add in the fish sauce, good balance with the saltiness, fishiness, sourness of the sauce and the freshness of the salad.</li><li>I love all the special rolls, because there they were not big, and not too much rice, and the sauce was delicious!</li><li>Beef sashimi is to diiieeee for- soft and the sauce is great.</li><li>We were then told that the flakes were indeed fish and that the sauce is shrimp sauce.</li><li>Everything was delicious, and I loved the different textures between the crispy lechon kawali with the sweet gooey sauce and the different noodles and crunchy beans in the sampaguita pancit.</li><li>The sauce had a nice balance to it ............ as someone else mentioned, just a slight spice to it somewhere.</li><li>I had Wiener schnitzel which was accompanied by little dumplings and sauce.</li><li>The sauce on the enchiladas was perfect and so fresh- everything was wonderfully flavourful the portions of the enchiladas made me feel satisfied but not over-stuffed.</li><li>The beef was melt in your mouth tender, the sauce was a bit spicy for my taste, but he enjoyed it. ( we asked for next time, and you can request a milder sauce) We 'll definitely be coming back for more !!</li><li>Still the sauce was very very thick and full of corn starch it seemed.</li><li>The sauce was bland and tasteless too ....</li><li>The Four Alarm is the hottest sauce but easily manageable.</li><li>The two orders came out relatively quickly and they enjoyed their meals, although commenting that the sauce was a bit too sweet in comparison with other General Tso chicken they 've had.</li><li>The veal parmigiana is excellent, although it does n't come with very much sauce, so it is dry and even when you ask for extra extra extra extra sauce you still only get just a touch more. if you are in the area and looking for a great Italian restaurant I would definitely come here and check Rossini out for yourself.</li><li>The sauce was rich but I would have appreciated more chunks of lobster rather than shreds.</li><li>It came with a miso soup, edamame, and the bento box ( rice, salad, chicken, tofu, japchae). everything was average; the sauce on the chicken teriyaki was overpowering.</li><li>The ginger tofu dish had a good sauce and was tasty too but they cut up large slivers of ginger into it and we both felt that was a bit much.</li><li>It had some sweet from the sauce and citrus fruit, some bulk from the chicken and cashew.</li><li>I think these two meals are comparable with the pasta, sauce and protein yet one was $ 19 and the other $ 16, a price differentiation that did n't seem right.</li><li>The sauce was very bland and I actually had to add salt to it, which is not something I normally do.</li><li>I thought that maybe getting takeout would taint my experience but I 'm sure the sauce would n't have been more flavourful even if I had dined in.</li><li>There were chunks of fat attached to chicken that were well masqueraded by the sauce but that I could taste.</li><li>It 's the highest-quality pizza I 've ever had the opportunity to taste; it 's the perfect blend of tomato, sauce, cheese and crust.</li><li>I did n't use any of it because the dish was covered in red spicy sauce.</li><li>We ordered the seafood version of this, not realizing that the sauce was the same, but it was still good!</li><li>The sauce is delicious, and do n't forget the cheese, lots and lots of cheese on the veal !!!</li><li>The sauce was very fresh and seasoned very well.</li><li>The sauce is a bit thick and I cannot taste the fish.</li><li>The sauce is too strong to take away the taste and smell of the fish.</li><li>We had a variation of the Poached Sable fish yesterday, with the same sauce and cooking style ( the fish choice was changed based on the family request), but it was fantastic.</li><li>The crusted beef was just so perfect with the incredible sauce.</li><li>These were a great first dish, the sauce really helped bring out the flavour of the mango and carrots inside.</li><li>The sauce had a hint of wasabi which gave it a nice kick.</li><li>The beef is so nicely cooked and the genius of it 's crispy texture goes so well with the complex sauce it bathes in.</li><li>The first time I had the staple pad Thai which had an unappealing sauce blend.</li><li>Although the golden sauce is actually made with plum sugar, the tamarind sauce that 's also used almost overpowers it; and then balances it to ease off the sweetness.</li><li>Meat and sauce were both good.</li><li>Duck wrapped in rice with a really nice sauce.</li><li>The best part is the curry sauce- just the right amount of spice ( and I 'm not a spice eater) and delicious flavour that you 'll want to take home just the sauce to dip bread!</li><li>I had it a month ago with my family, the sauce is amazing and goes really well with the vietnamese bun and roti they serve with.</li><li>It came with some ok hummus and a very potent garlic sauce, which is more crushed garlic then sauce.</li><li>The sauce and paste just makes the fries soggy, and the flavour is just like covering fries in Frank 's ..... stick with the middle eastern appetizers!</li><li>I had the eggs benny and it was horrible, runny and bland sauce, bad and under cooked homefries with worse service.</li><li>Remind you, I asked for it extra saucy; so these things are drenched in the buffalo butter sauce ( yummy sauce) ... and guess what i see.</li><li>Ordered: Coconut Shrimps* 5 pieces of coconut shrimps for $ 9.75* Shrimps were butterflied and deep fried with actual coconut bits in the batter* When it arrived, it was just luke warm* And the sauce looked like it was from McDonalds ( seriously ?)* I was the one who wanted to try them and boy, did I regret ordering these* For $ 10, this was def not worth it Ordered: Lobster Bisque* Small personal lobster bisque for $ 8.95* This was n't very hot either but it was delicious!* It is super creamy and rich with lobster meats* My dad loved this and finished a entire cup himself* It is def not cheap but very much worth it Ordered: Jumbo Garlic Shrimps* 9 jumbo shrimps Butterflied and Baked $ 25.50* If lobster is not your thing, they always have shrimp dishes* They were perfectly cooked and had good flavor with garlic bits* It was kind of on the dry side but with the melted butter it was fine* I just tried one of this and my sister had the rest of it Ordered: 2lb Steamed Lobster &amp; 4lb Broiled Lobster* 2lb lobster was $ 57.00 and 4lb lobster is $ 97.00* You can choose the lobster to be steamed or broiled* I mostly had the broiled 4lb ( obviously shared it with others)* Steamed had much clean taste since no other seasoning was used* Broiled lobster tasted more rich with the crust on top* 4lb lobster was so huge the claw was as big as my face* They get pretty messy to eat so you are given a plastic bib to put around your neck Summary: I walked in not expecting much but I fully enjoyed the meal at The Lobster Trap.</li><li>Not good sauce.</li><li>Chicken Chow Mein- Noodles and sauce were good, chicken was nasty, Chinese broccoli was huge stalks, very little greens, and was practically raw.</li><li>At least the sauce was amazing, a perfect balance of sweet and garlic.</li><li>The sauce they used was just addicting ... kind of like a thick Teriyaki sauce.</li><li>I would n't eat this all the time though, since the flavour of the sauce is bold and become very repetitive.</li><li>We just kept on with our conversation and soon everything was ready to be eaten! 4 of us ( including me!) are self proclaimed wusses when it comes to spicy food, and the Joon 's original sauce was ok for the 3 having the Dak Gal Bee, but too much for one of my friends having the Bulgogi.</li><li>My friend who generally can eat spicy food did n't find the sauce spicy though, so I guess it 's just a matter of preference.</li><li>The noodle itself is cold but the sauce is warm.</li><li>Boneless chicken in a spicy peanut sauce- the sauce is super delicious.</li><li>When the starters came, no plates or bowls at all, does it look like we want to let all the sauce drip everywhere on the table ?!?</li><li>Had their Biang Biang noodles which was tasty but had a pool ( literally) of oil as part of their sauce.</li><li>Its chicken with sesame ( peanut ?) sauce was my favorite.</li><li>I ate a quarter of the potato one ( sauce was delicious!) and like an eighth of the meat one.</li><li>Each fish filet was well seasoned with garlic and the sauce, extremely flavorful.</li><li>Every time, they tend to forget something ... e.g., sauce, straw, napkins, etc. by the time you get the sauce ( if you are lucky), your food is literally borderline frozen.</li><li>Every time, they tend to forget something ... e.g., sauce, straw, napkins, etc. by the time you get the sauce ( if you are lucky), your food is literally borderline frozen.</li><li>The chicken balls are very soft and have a `` fresh'' taste to them and the sauce is sweet and does n't taste like ketchup.</li><li>The meat is lean enough without losing flavour or tenderness and the sauce is great.</li><li>Once I tried it, I could not taste the sauce.</li><li>Was perfectly cooked and the sauce was great!</li><li>Other than than the meatballs the sauce was pretty good.</li><li>The wrap was soaked in clear liquid so it was soggy, and the sauce was pouring out of it making it not just bad tasting but also messy so I gave up.</li><li>The lasagna was very soft and the sauce was irremarkable.</li><li>The sauce to noodle ratio for the jajangmyung was so that the noodles mixed together were really saucy.</li><li>The chicken itself was a little bit dry but the sauce was delicious.</li><li>Ordering extra sauce on the side means you get less sauce in the small container plus an additional $ 1 per container, but I think it 's a worthwhile cost to prevent soggy fried chicken.</li><li>We ordered the boneless fried chicken with green onions ( S), fried chicken in spicy sauce ( S), and fries ( Costco like fries!).</li><li>Must try the fried chicken ( not greasy at all) and sauce ( a combination of spicy, sour, sweet) that goes with the fried chicken!</li><li>Their sauce is to die for.</li><li>Alot of times their sweet and sour sauce tastes too much like ketchup and the sauce is very running and not thick.</li><li>Not a myriad of sauces to choose from, but you do n't need much and the sauce is hardly overwhelming which I enjoy.</li><li>The sauce on the wing was magical in a sense.</li><li>It was a nice dish when some of the spicy sauce was mixed in; the pot crisped the rice nicely, and the veggies were fresh.</li><li>A good amount of ingredients and a very good sauce to go with.</li><li>The standard burrito build is rice, your choice of re-fried or black beans, grilled veggies ( mixed peppers and onions mostly), mild or medium sauce, both tomato and corn salsas, cheese, lettuce and sour cream.</li><li>The honey garlic chicken was delicious though the sauce is VERY sweet.</li><li>The gnocchi was cooked nicely, but the sauce was simple and did n't have that much flavor.</li><li>The caesar salad was also a full bed of romaine heart spines with little sauce.</li><li>The sauce did not salvage anything and i had a sore jaw the next day from chewing that hockey puck.</li><li>The pizza was sort of like a crispy frozen flatbread with more sweet canned sauce, I was very disturbed.</li><li>Thin ( crisp) crust, the way it should be, JUST the right amount of sauce and cheese ... what 's not to love.</li><li>As for the food itself ... possibly one of the WORST foods I 've ever had in my life .. the chicken was pretty much ALL just bone chunks and the sauce was soo sticcky from sitting out in the open for so long and I could n't take it ... okay maybe their dessert will be better ?</li><li>The waiter was charged me for the extra sauce.</li><li>I usually get the lasagna, with the generous amount of sauce and ground beef.</li><li>Beef bulgogi 's sauce was a little on the syrupy side.</li><li>The pasta is cooked perfectly and it is n't overwhelmed or overshadowed by the sauce.</li><li>Their Peking duck is $ 30 and it includes only first course with a limit of 12 pancakes, the duck itself is rather fatty for my liking and their sauce is too concentrated.</li><li>It has the perfect amount of sauce and meat, super filling!</li><li>For the chicken, the sauce was really nice, tomatoe-y but not too heavy.</li><li>It tasted like the sauce was mixed in with the pasta and it was sitting it a pot for a while in the back and they plopped in in my plate and served it to me.</li><li>The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, the sauce was not too thick nor too watery, it was just right.</li><li>I really enjoyed the sauce, subtle hints of tomatoes, garlic, chive danced around with the marinated ground beef in a medley of flavor!</li><li>When you bite into the tender veal with the combination of the sauce and fresh bread and sweated onions, it 's amazing.</li><li>The sauce to me is perfect.</li><li>The sauce is the best part in my opinion.</li><li>I especially love the potatoes with this sweat kind of sauce.</li><li>If they seasoned it better, I would n't need an extra sauce.</li><li>The green curry chicken was lacking in meat, and the sauce was watery and had no flavour or heat.</li><li>All 3 were quite good with the snails being the most interesting ( roasted on a slice of roasted eggplant, hint of blue cheese), the main being the most satisfying ( sliced of tenderloin with a nice sauce and vegetables and the desert rounding things out ( 7 kinds of chocolate ... need I say more ?) ...</li><li>I forgot beyond having a vague idea which of the little dimsum delights you put the spicy mustard on and which you dip into the red watery sauce, I really had no clue.</li><li>The sauce ( Stockyards!) was pretty bland.</li><li>I liked the sauce and never had anything like it.</li><li>If not for the sauce ( which was n't very good either), it would have no flavour at all.</li><li>The sauce was fairly addictive and worked very well with the seafood pancake.</li><li>I asked for extra st louis dill sauce and she said she would charge me $ 0.83 per extra sauce.</li><li>The sauce has a sweet tomato flavour which was good on the ribs, but they were also great just plain.</li><li>The sauce they offer on the side isnt bbq sauce it 's some mexican sauce that taste a little weird to me but it wasnt bad.</li><li>I tried a few things including the saikyo style baked scallops ( $ 7.50) the scallops were meaty, fresh and they were drowned in a generous amount of cheese and delicious sauce.</li><li>If you have time and some cheddar to spend, then I insist on getting their beef short ribs in unique sauce.</li><li>Honorable mention would have to be the chicken katsu don, which is a fried chicken cutlet with a rich sweet and tangy sauce.</li><li>You pile it high in a bowl, from a choice of meats to a great variety of veggies, add sauce and/or seasonings and hand it over.</li><li>You can choose your veggies, your meat and your sauce and voila you have what I call stir steamed veggies within under 2 minutes.</li><li>I made a rookie mistake of piling on the sauce ... so much so that my oodles were literally drowning in it ... so it made my meal not as tasty as I had hoped.</li><li>Walk two steps and add sauce.</li><li>It was covered in their basic sauce, as the waitress said, and it went really well with the baby bok choi.</li><li>The sauce is thick and packs a punch, unlike watery and bland options typical of Thai-style joints.</li><li>The sauce made the lamb taste like dish detergent so I 'm not sure what Rosemary sauce was used but rosemary does NOT taste like that.</li><li>The sauce was interesting it was tomatoey, and I think they added crab eggs in it, which was interesting and added a nice texture.</li><li>They were big chicken breasts that did not absorb the sauce.</li><li>Only exception would be the actual chicken was a little bit dry, but the sauce was amazing especially with the Garlic Nan.</li><li>The evaporated onion &amp; tomatoes in the sauce overwhelmed whatever spices used for the curry, and the base of the sauce was flat.</li><li>The sauce was very thin, was extremely bland to the point where I considered calling to complain.</li><li>The Chicken was flavourless and the sauce tasted like something I could buy in a bottle in a grocery store.</li><li>Also, the sauce it came with tasted like homemade Ketchup.</li><li>Ordered over-medium once and received over easy, which was unappetising and went uneaten. ... love this mom and pops place! the staff is quite friendly and the owner always greets us personally whenever he 's around. i have personally only ever ordered from their all day breakfast menu so i ca n't speak for their lunch and dinner but it is the best breakfast at the most decent price. while i have ordered many breakfast dishes, my favorite go-to is the eggs benedict with smoked salmon and asparagus. i must have had this dish once a week for the past year and it 's been cooked to perfection every time. the sauce is not too heavy, not too light. the eggs are always made the way you like it- i make sure i get them to soft poach them. home fries are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. weekend mornings and brunch time get pretty busy but it is always worth the wait:).</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
