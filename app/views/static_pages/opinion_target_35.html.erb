<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 35' %><h2>cheese<br />occurrence: 224</h2><div><ol><li>Whenever I call to them about my issues they never really seem to apologize, rather blame it on me; `` you did not tell me no sunflower seeds'' ( i did) `` do n't leave the salad in the car or the veggies get brown'' ( i never do) `` my chef forgot to put in the carrots, I will give you extra next time'' ( I watched her make my salad, not a chef &amp; my salad literally had lettuce, cheese and 4 mandarin oranges in it).</li><li>The last entrée arrived, and exactly like the other burger entrée, the bacon was overcooked and the cheese was hard, as if it had been sitting for a while.</li><li>Good variety of Turkish items and decent selection of cheese.</li><li>The only reason I bothered with the souvlaki was the salad, they used almost no cheese ( I understand with prices going up and whatnot) but the worst part was that they skimped on the cheapest ingredient.</li><li>I wanted Pizzaiolo since they carry vegan pizzas and generally, places that have vegan pizzas on the menu will taste better than ones that let cheese do the heavy lifting.</li><li>However, now seem to all come doughy and undercooked with very little cheese.</li><li>Its as if they are being frugal with their cheese stocks to make an extra buck.</li><li>I just ordered a Bomba and it had less cheese than a plain cheese single topping pizza should have.</li><li>I ordered the Chicken, Spinach and Cheese filled Crepe, and my mother ordered the Quinoa Salad.</li><li>Inside the meal was n't too piping hot, the cheese was melting though.</li><li>They were very generous with things like truffle oil, and cheese ...</li><li>For the carnivores out there you will appreciate how each bite was loaded with meat and the cheese just oozed out in all the right places.</li><li>This was on the layer underneath the cheese.</li><li>The bacon crumbled when I poked it ( McDonalds has better bacon, seriously guys ...) and the cheese was falling all over the place and not not particularly good.</li><li>The tomatoes were nice and juicy and the cheese was very tasty, the salad was perfect with just the right amount of sauce to salad ratio.</li><li>Extremely filling from yummy cheese.</li><li>However, I ordered the diavolo pizza and was disappointed; it was heavy on the ( low quality) cheese and very sparse on all the other toppings.</li><li>The recommended `` chef 's specialty'' item here is an eggplant covered in cheese.</li><li>FOOD: Antipasto- Good amount of meats and cheese, but a tad pricey for what it is.</li><li>No pizza nova ever gives me enough cheese, not just this location, it 's a pizza nova wide crisis.</li><li>I forgot why I do n't order from there, so I did, and now I remember; the cheese does n't stick to the pizza ... had to eat the cheese and crust separately.</li><li>I forgot why I do n't order from there, so I did, and now I remember; the cheese does n't stick to the pizza ... had to eat the cheese and crust separately.</li><li>Order here if you want something other than cheese or pepperoni pizzas.</li><li>Very thick with breading and did n't have a lot of cheese.</li><li>I did n't get the usual pepper and cheese until I had to ask.</li><li>A plain cheese slice is closer to New York style than most.</li><li>It has a thin crust with the nicest cheese on it.</li><li>Top picks: vegetarian poutine, mac &amp; cheese, plain pizza Other good choices: kol bol salad, split pea soup I 've been going here my whole life.</li><li>They cheese is generous as are the very fresh toppings.</li><li>It 's not bad and resembles a bit of Burrito ingredients when I got to the interior Mixes of the Cheese, Beans &amp; Chicharron.</li><li>I absolutely love their fried plantains with beans and fresh cheese.</li><li>You can taste the chicharron, cheese and beans.</li><li>The pupusas are made to perfection, perfect ratio of masa to pork and cheese.</li><li>I had Orange Juice &amp; the Poached Egg with fruit and cottage cheese.</li><li>They rush to bring you uncooked breakfast, the cheese on the omelette is not even melted and stays solid ......</li><li>Egg mc muffin with sausage get a cheese and muffin only no meat.</li><li>Ample chunks of cheese and just the right amount of gravy.</li><li>( Is it just me or is it anyone else 's pet peeve to have the cheese favoring one side and the bun stuck on crooked ?)</li><li>Do n't know if it was the cheese or the ham ( although if I had not read the menu I would not have been able to tell you that there was either cheese or ham in the sandwich from taste alone.</li><li>Do n't know if it was the cheese or the ham ( although if I had not read the menu I would not have been able to tell you that there was either cheese or ham in the sandwich from taste alone.</li><li>For that you get sparsely sliced apples i think 4 in total, with a nice hearty bread and the stated cheese nicely melted.</li><li>Since in Colombia, Arepa usually eaten as Breakfast or Afternoon snacks, so most of the Arepa here at Arepiando has cheese and eggs as the main ingredients!</li><li>Nice basic Greek and Italian dishes, with a few American options ( hoagies are very good, even if it 's cheap white bread, cheap steak, and cheap cheese ... works nicely).</li><li>They did n't skimp on the cheese, but the dough could have been a little more cooked in the middle ( of mine, anyway).</li><li>Pizza- very cheesy which is a good thing if you like cheese.</li><li>Did not skimp on cheese.</li><li>For a treat, sometimes the empanadas with cheese are great with sugar sprinkled on top.</li><li>Ecuadorian Empanadas- Cheese.</li><li>Great patio 7/10 crab cakes ( fresh and good size, but undercooked) 2/10 French onion soup ( too much cheese, not enough broth, very bland) 8/10 oysters ( good taste but very small, overpriced for size) 5/10 swordfish tacos 8/10 for steak salad.</li><li>It tasted like a basic cheese.</li><li>Perhaps most popular would be their pizzas, that come fresh out of the oven loaded with cheese and toppings.</li><li>Hidden in a sketchy looking strip mall, next to a sushi restaurant that 's also pretty fabulous, is this small mom-and-pop Italian grocery store that sells fresh cheese, bread, deli meats &amp; Italian desserts, in addition to a small selection of imported goods.</li><li>I was craving something meaty so I ordered the meatball sandwich with cheese and onions.</li><li>We ordered the babaganoush dip, cheese and spinach `` pizza'', and the full combo platter that came with 2 pitas and hummus dip.</li><li>And no cheese to make my fries a poutine ..</li><li>Once our pasta dishes arrived the server said she would be back with fresh cheese .... we never saw her again, until we flagged her down to pay.</li><li>Over all, a nice place but if we come back, we 'll be sure to order something different next time! ok it 's no fluke the wood oven pizza here is very good. ( we ordered two kinds to try) the dough, sauce and cheese the base ingredients of most any pizza are top notch. the crust i would describe .. it 's not a thin where it 's paper thin and it 's not cooked crisp like I 've had at many other thin crust pizza places. having its so crisp hides the true identity of the pizza dough. how can one taste the crust if it 's burnt !? the crust is thin where one can bite into the dough know it 's dough and not thick enough to not overwhelm the toppings. my quattro stagione was made wrong though .. it suppose to be separate quarters of pizza with the individual toppings. but instead it was a pizza with all the toppings. c 'mon just because I do n't look italian does n't mean I do n't know how it 's suppose to be. do n't give me stupid excuses that things get roughed up in the oven that why that make it that way ? i do n't care for the chatty waitress here and the ridiculous excuses, but as i mentioned in my first review. i will come here for the food because the cooks and chefs in the back know what they are doing ..</li><li>What I loved:- extra cheese included many choices such as goat cheese, cheddar and Monterey Jack- extra bacon included 2-3 slices- guacamole was free- lots of great fixings to order from, veggies were also fresh ...- so much free sauce and spices ...</li><li>So much character compared to Hero and they do n't charge an arm and leg for extra toppings ( except for cheese).</li><li>For some reason the fries were dry, the cheese was not fully melted and I think this is because the gravy was lumpy, thick and cold.</li><li>I could tell it had sat out for a bit, but I think it actually made it better because the sauce was absorbed fully and the cheese was all melty.</li><li>Service was terrible and the cheese on the burritos was n't even melted because they wrapped the burrito the wrong way.</li><li>The woman gave me a strange look when I requested a naked burrito without rice, beans, cheese, sauce, or sour cream.</li><li>They are frugal with their cheese.</li><li>For starters we tried their Roasted Beet Salad, Beef Carpaccio and Caprino Salad ( mushrooms, roasted red peppers and goat 's cheese).</li><li>And goat 's cheese in any salad for me is super!</li><li>It was nice and warm and not overpowered by the cheese.</li><li>I say takeout but they do have some tiny little tables if you want to get real intimate while gulping down greasy slices of cheese and bread.</li><li>Called had a pleasant conversation and ordered a large pizza with pepperoni, bacon, Italian sausage and extra cheese, and a veal parmesan with hot peppers and mushrooms on a bun.</li><li>Then we ordered cheese and meat platter.</li><li>Did n't want to make a scandal, so asked the guy who took away the dishes if the mold was supposed to be on the cheese ( obviously not).</li><li>I would have given it 5 stars if they wrote down my allergies ( and not asked me twice if I wanted cheese- one of my more serious allergies) and I had seen the green peppers described.</li><li>Plus a chicken flauta- crisp tortilla, rolled and stuffed smothered with sour cream, guarcamole, and cheese.</li><li>The enchiladas was basic, not too pleased that the cheese was n't melted on top as that is what makes the dish.</li><li>Actually other then the cheese and tortilla.</li><li>It 's $ 13.95 per portion and we added cheese and noodles.</li><li>Mediocre food, portions were smaller than usually, u have to add cheese, ramen and rice cake, do n't bother getting the rice add ones We waited 30mins for our food to come and they would n't give us our side dishes until our meal came ......</li><li>And cheese needs to add extra $ 2.</li><li>I had the burger, no extra toppings ( cheese, bacon $ 1.29 each).</li><li>Food: we ordered butter chicken, beef vindaloo, panak paneer as well as cheese and garlic naan.</li><li>But we had to keep asking for napkins, cheese, bread and water.</li><li>There was a good amount of cheese used which pleased my little one.</li><li>It 's the highest-quality pizza I 've ever had the opportunity to taste; it 's the perfect blend of tomato, sauce, cheese and crust.</li><li>The burger came with guacamole, bacon, onions, tomatoes, lettuce, a lot of cheese and a pickle .... the side was half onion rings half fries ( first time I ever see this kind of side at a pub ?).</li><li>My burger had all of the major food groups: spice, cheese, veggies, bacon, and beef.</li><li>It did n't really even need cheese.</li><li>The sauce is delicious, and do n't forget the cheese, lots and lots of cheese on the veal !!!</li><li>The sauce is delicious, and do n't forget the cheese, lots and lots of cheese on the veal !!!</li><li>The food was horrible, the chicken was under cooked, too sour, it was not stuffed with anything and it came with bones! spinach was below the chicken and the cheese was melted on top of the chicken chew skin: (, half a spoon of mashed potato that did not taste good and couple of carrots scattered around the dish.</li><li>I do n't know about anyone but i like my cheese melted on my eggs. just picture this sandwich: dry cold egg, on warm bagel, with stale lettuce and tomatoes, between cheese and egg, with no sauce or butter or anything that would make the sandwich stick together, beside the juice from the runny old tomatoes.</li><li>For $ 9.00, the sandwich did have a lot of meat, but no taste and they did n't even have cheese.</li><li>I always get fish filet, end up having the cheese on top or outside of my sandwich 80% of the time here.</li><li>Cream cheese and lox on a poppy seed twister ...</li><li>Delectable cheese and blueberry pastry.</li><li>And for the people who crave cheese and lox, go buy some, you do n't have to go get it here on a hard bagel twist.</li><li>I wake up on Saturday mornings and crave the Bacon Veggie Melt It 's a Benedict style dish with green peppers, onions, mushrooms, spinach, and bacon atop a perfect poached egg and an english muffin covered in hollandaise &amp; cheese.</li><li>My friend and I shared the chicken and seafood dak gal bee with the Joon 's original sauce and cheese.</li><li>I added rice cakes, chicken, and cheese!</li><li>We only added cheese to half of the order and it was definitely enough for that whole pan.</li><li>I loved their schmorgashboard of ramen, cheese, chicken, rice sticks and sweet potato in one dish!</li><li>We added rice cakes, cheese, and ramen noodles.</li><li>We shared three portions of DakGalBee with noodles, chicken, cheese and kimchi between 4 people.</li><li>I am a cheese fanatic so I would always get double cheese along with noodle as a carb.</li><li>I usually order the daegalbee with noodles, cheese, and rice cakes.</li><li>We 've ordered Chicken and seafood dakagalbi with extra cheese and ramen.</li><li>I always order JS1 with chicken, adding ramen, cheese and dubokki ( rice cakes).</li><li>My typical selection is cheese, noodles x2 since we have two people and sweet potato.</li><li>The chicken came fast, but it took a really long time for the cheese and noodles to arrive.</li><li>The waitresses helped mix the chicken with the cheese and noodles, however she had to bring the cooking table away from us as our table was too small.</li><li>The chicken was nothing special, though the cheese did help the 2-portion meal be a bit more filling.</li><li>The best way to enjoy this dish: make sure you add on rice cakes, cheese and instant noodles.</li><li>Plus you just ca n't go wrong with extra cheese.</li><li>We ordered the dak galbi with ramen, cheese and rice cakes.</li><li>Whenever I go I add the cheese, rice cakes and noodles.</li><li>Still a good staple place for dakgalbi, with cheese, ramen, and rice cakes being necessary add ons to make it an awesome meal.</li><li>We had added ramen and cheese ( $ 2 each) and even with those added, the dish was tiny.</li><li>Ordered the DakGalbee with cheese and ramen. i thought it was really good. and would definitely like to have more of it. the portions we got were pretty much just for sampling as we were restaurant hopping. it was n't spicy like i expected it to be. there was a slight kick but nothing that was making me sweat, tear up, or nose run. we also ordered the beef one with just cheese. aside from the meat. they pretty much taste the same.</li><li>We ordered the regular chicken dakgalbi with double cheese, ramen, and extra rice cakes.</li><li>Even with the double cheese and extra cakes, we felt like it was STILL too small a portion for the price.</li><li>More unique Korean food- mainly bring the big sizzling plate- which tastes great especially with cheese and noodle add on, but is n't very good value for money, as it is minimum two portions.</li><li>That orange glow, goopy cheese and instant noodle ca n't be all that good for you, but man, we ate well!</li><li>Dak galbi ( marinated chicken stir-fry on hot plate- traditionally dark meat chicken is used, but I do n't know what kind they use here) is their specialty but a la carte menu is offered too. banchan has the usual napa cabbage kimchi, beansprouts, but the one i especially like is their simple but good steamed broccoli with a dash of gochujang. personally i like gochujang with everything, but it may not be fore everyone. they also have a mashed potato banchan which i did not try. if your order the dak galbi, i recommend extra orders of tteok ( rice cake sticks), sweet potato and pumpkin. cheese ( looks and tastes like mozzarella) is offered too, giving it a fusion/modern twist. ramen is also on the menu. service is attentive, friendly and pleasant. quite a roomy restaurant, which is surprising if you merely look from the outside. unlike many other korean restaurants in toronto, you can actually linger here for a while, given enough seating for everyone. will DEFINITELY come again.</li><li>We added noodles, cheese and rice cakes and it was yummy:) The spice is perfect, enough to clear your sinuses, but not sweat profusely from the heat: p The downside I can think of is that service is a bit slow and the add ons ( rice cakes, noodles, cheese, rice etc) are extra.</li><li>We added noodles, cheese and rice cakes and it was yummy:) The spice is perfect, enough to clear your sinuses, but not sweat profusely from the heat: p The downside I can think of is that service is a bit slow and the add ons ( rice cakes, noodles, cheese, rice etc) are extra.</li><li>We ordered DakGalBee hot pot as our base and we also ordered cheese, noodles, etc with it by adding a few dollars.</li><li>I think the cheese helped tone down the spiciness, so it 's a good addition if you have low spice tolerance like me.</li><li>I got the cheese, rice cake, fish cake, veggies and extra ramen for this ramen dish and it was shared among two people.</li><li>My friends and I usually order the Seafood DakGalbee with cheese, rice cakes and Joon 's special sauce.</li><li>There 's an extra cost for the cheese and rice cakes however, it 's all worth it !!</li><li>You can order a multitude of add-ons like ramen noodles, rice cakes, cheese, etc.</li><li>The noodles and sauce mixed with mozzarella cheese is the best part of it and you might be tempted to ask for a double order of cheese because that melty goodness on every chopstick full will leave you wanting more.</li><li>Add cheese and noodle with is the best with the hot sauce.</li><li>We ordered it with cheese and ramen and rice cakes soooooo good.</li><li>The dakgalbi dishes now require you to place a minimum of 2 orders per dish, which can be quite pricey, considering the popular add ons- rice cakes, noodles and cheese, are an additional ~ $ 2 each.</li><li>For the three of us, it came close to $ 18/person, so not really the best value. been going there since it opened on yonge. love their Dak Gal Bee ( table cooking of spicy chicken with veggies) do n't forget to add rice cake, yam n double cheese !!</li><li>The JS1 is just normal dak gal bee with chicken and vegetable where you can add on the rice cakes, cheese, noodles, sweet potato, vegetable, steamed rice and fried rice for $ 1- $ 2 each.</li><li>- GET IT WITH CHEESE!: D- I 'm always full, if not completely stuffed, after a meal at Joon 's!</li><li>My friend got the recommended Ossobuco Panino. braised veal, caramelized onions, arugula and cheese.</li><li>1) Margherita pizza ( $ 10) Nice thin crust with a good amount of cheese.</li><li>The sandwich felt very wholesome with their unique Calabrese artisan bread, packed with baby spinach, cheese, tomato, pancetta ( Italian bacon, woo!), locally sourced fresh grilled chicken ( !!) and a kick from the salsa verde aioli.</li><li>The Caesar was easily the best I 've had, just enough dressing to wet the leaves but no clumps, just enough cheese and garnish ( bacon) to dress the dish up.</li><li>Gently seasoned with cheese shavings on top.</li><li>It was tasty but it is basically some frozen corn on a hot plate with some cheese.</li><li>When you have ham, pineapple and cheese in your mouth, it tastes sensational!</li><li>They are rude to customers and do n't know how to properly put cheese on the pizza.</li><li>The toppings were blanketed by cheese.</li><li>No crust, just couple of pistachios here and there, i honestly do n't taste anything-no cheese, no pistachio, just ... cream ? not my kind of cheesecake. nice chocolate designs though. overall, i find the desserts meh.</li><li>Total was $ 90, for the size and skimpyness of the three large pizzas and 2 tiny garlic breads ( $ 6 before cheese add-on), wasnt worth it at all.</li><li>Whoever made my pizza thought they could get away with using a crap load of caesar sauce to mask the fact that they majorly skimped out on the cheese.</li><li>The cheese is a little crispy and so are the toppings.</li><li>It basically is just dough with sauce, cheese, and some toppings, but that 's how they make a profit.</li><li>I paid $ 42 for 2 medium pizzas so with this price I was expecting something decent.while the 4 cheese one ( bomba) was not bad the veggie lover which had spinach, mushroom pepper and tomato was a disaster the whole thing tasted and felt like it was drenched in water.</li><li>I have to say this pizza was pretty darn good, there was a ton of cheese, without having to ask them to make sure there is cheese like some Pizza Pizza locations which I have stopped going to because they seem to hoard the cheese!</li><li>I have to say this pizza was pretty darn good, there was a ton of cheese, without having to ask them to make sure there is cheese like some Pizza Pizza locations which I have stopped going to because they seem to hoard the cheese!</li><li>I have to say this pizza was pretty darn good, there was a ton of cheese, without having to ask them to make sure there is cheese like some Pizza Pizza locations which I have stopped going to because they seem to hoard the cheese!</li><li>It was amazing though, a ton of cheese, three kinds of meat ( sausage, peperoni, bacon) pan crust about 1 `` thick, it 's the stuff pizza dreams are made of.</li><li>This place is next to chucky cheese.</li><li>I was at Chucky cheese for a birthday party, but did n't want to eat there.</li><li>But its at Sheppard Ave .. attached to a mall and next to chucky cheese.</li><li>These were basically the cheese stings that you get at groceries deep fried and the apple sauce was actually from the supermarket ( Motts Fruitsations- refer to picture).</li><li>This is a pancake wrapped around layered eggs, cheese, and bacon, and it comes with a little pitcher of syrup.</li><li>We ordered the Mac and cheese and it was way too salty and swimming in a cheese sauce that was way too watery.</li><li>Also, this whole fad of putting bacon on Mac and cheese is getting old but good if executed properly.</li><li>Then you pick your meat ( chicken, beef, pulled pork, pulled beef, fish and shrimp) and toppings ( four salsas, cheese, beans, sour cream, lettuce).</li><li>The lettuce was crisp ( void of brown spots), the tomatoes were fresh, the salsa was flavourful ( though spicy is not so spicy), and the cheese smelled and tasted just fine.</li><li>It 's assembly-line style ordering: type of tortitlla, type of meat ( I 've had pulled pork), toppings like veggies, cheese, guac ( EXTRA $ $), sour cream, and type of salsa ( warning: the hot IS hot).</li><li>The standard burrito build is rice, your choice of re-fried or black beans, grilled veggies ( mixed peppers and onions mostly), mild or medium sauce, both tomato and corn salsas, cheese, lettuce and sour cream.</li><li>I loaded it with hot pepper flakes and cheese ...</li><li>I will NEVER come back here. started with the bruschetta and it was 2 small pieces of bread with tomatoes and cheap cheese toasted on top.</li><li>Even the cheese was cheap and nasty. just CHEAP food and I can have a better meal going to loblaws and buying a frozen tv dinner.</li><li>As others have said, this is a half-restaurant and half-groceries setup, where the grocery section is baked goods ( bread and pastries) as well as a moderate selection of other things ( cheese, pasta sauce, etc.).</li><li>Thin ( crisp) crust, the way it should be, JUST the right amount of sauce and cheese ... what 's not to love.</li><li>Then when I tasted the food I just felt like I was transported away to some breezy bistro on the coast of Italy where I was tasting the most authentic freshly housemade alfredo pasta with cheese filling- so worthy of the 5 lbs of fat I will likely gain over the next week:) I have no regrets!</li><li>I usually come here for the cheap breakfast sandwiches which will cost you no more than $ 4 and unless you decide to get something fancy with extra cheese and bacon.</li><li>If they ask if you want cheese on your garlic bread, REMEMBER THAT THEY CHARGE YOU $ 2.5 for it.</li><li>We ordered a bunch of appetizers and food for the table ( meats, cheese, pizza, potato, and roasted vegetables) there was a lot of food and it was just ok.</li><li>They changed their menu and now its extra charge for cheese, sauteed mushroom, etc instead of having cheeseburgers on the actual menu .. which is the same thing I guess.</li><li>( Think of the shredded cheese as a `` toupee'' for the garbage that it is hiding underneath it.)</li><li>I recommend getting the veal with cheese and mushrooms.</li><li>A pita, with some sauce and cheese and some sliced red peppers and chicken pieces on top, cut into quarters.</li><li>They charge up to $ 2.00 eachfor additional toppings like mushrooms, peppers and cheese.</li><li>I ordered the spicy veal sandwich with cheese and grilled veggies.</li><li>Ordered the veal w/ cheese and mild sauce ...</li><li>My sandwich of choice is the veal sandwich with cheese.</li><li>The ratio of meat to cheese to sauce to bun is perfect.</li><li>The texture of the slightly crusty exterior and soft interior of the bun, along with the 2-3 layers of thin, but crispy veal, the melted cheese, and the sauce comes together to create a sandwich that is layered to perfection.</li><li>I have only ever had the chicken before with cheese and onions and its so nice.</li><li>It starts out at $ 7 but only gets higher when you start adding ( necessary) toppings like cheese and hot peppers.</li><li>I got the medium peppers and cheese added to it, which came out to like $ 10.</li><li>The hot peppers and cheese worked very well and complements the sandwich perfectly.</li><li>If you ca n't do the peppers, do NOT order it without cheese.</li><li>When that cheese melts, you have the perfect sandwich.</li><li>Chicken sandwich, less sauce, sweet peppers, mushrooms and cheese.</li><li>My angry growling stomach became much friendlier after sharing those four crispy Italian spring rolls loaded with bocconcini cheese, proscuitto, roasted red pepper, and basil dipped in a balsamic vinegar redux.</li><li>To top off the veggie skillet there is a supposed coating of cheese.</li><li>However on the one that arrived for my order, there were sad bits of burnt cheese sparsely laid out over top of basically mushy-kinda-cold-and-overly-moist potatoes.</li><li>I did find though that the cheese gave the English muffins more of a gooey texture instead of crisp and toasted and the hollandaise sauce had started to separate.</li><li>They were also VERY generous with the cheese in my salad which made me very happy.</li><li>All burgers are frozen, cheese is not real.</li><li>I got one veggie burger ... with an egg and cheese ... surprisingly awesome!</li><li>The cheese is tasteless and burgers are obviously frozen patties.</li><li>The crust is perfectly crispy, the cheese and extra tomato sauce melts together and are amazing.</li><li>I should 've asked but the cheese tasted and looked like blue cheese.</li><li>The taste was strong and pungent and the cheese was all melted not the creamy gooey brie cheese kind of melted but more like melted butter all runny.</li><li>There was one with cream cheese and shrimp that was unbelievable!</li><li>App 's = Fried cauliflower- had it today was pretty awesome, Bourekas ( filo/fluff type pastry with spinach and cheese- delicious).</li><li>Pizza is very good, nice cheese blend and the crust is so crispy and delicious.</li><li>There was n't enough cheese, and the few strands of fries on the pizza was crispy but lacked flavor.</li><li>This location is not as convenient as their other locations if you are driving but perfect if you are using public transit as it is close to North York Station. stopped in this place for some apps and cake and we ended up with stomach aches. the whole experience was a dissapointment. we had clamari which was rubbery and a small portion. i am a huge calamari fan and this dish was a huge dissapointment. i have had calamari at the brampton symposium many times and loved it everytime. we also had a pita bread pizza type bread with gouda and chicken. the gouda was shredded and sparring. the chicken lacked flavour and fell off the pita with each bite due to lack of cheese to meld it all together. the cheescake was ok. it was extremely soft, nearly a mouse texture and it lacked the delicious graham cracker bottom which is my fav part of cheesecake. the chocolate caramel cake was also a mousse like texture. the caramel was drizzled on top and was eaten in two bites by my 4 year old. the cake lacked any other caramel flavour. it was a large piece and most of it was left behind. i ordered a steamed milk to go with the cake and they forgot to serve it. one star is generous for this place. i would give it a zero if i could.</li><li>I thought you ca n't go wrong with eggplants stuffed with mushrooms and cheese.</li><li>You are able to add extra toppings like mushroom, cheese and bacon.</li><li>The appetizer was `` bacon wrapped mac and cheese'' we were super excited because really how can you go wrong with anything bacon:).</li><li>Some memorable dishes for me:- the blanched SPINACH SALAD starter- super palate cleansing- SASHIMI NIGIRI- did n't check/could n't figure out what fish these were, but so buttery fresh. rice was very appropriately sized to the fish portion- SASHIMI LETTUCE ROLLS- seeing shredded lettuce wrapped within my sashimi felt weird to me, but it did help pick up some extra of the ponzu-type dressing so that it was adequately saucy- BAKED OYSTER- diced and baked with a cream sauce, topped with cheese and baked in the giant shell.</li><li>I tried a few things including the saikyo style baked scallops ( $ 7.50) the scallops were meaty, fresh and they were drowned in a generous amount of cheese and delicious sauce.</li><li>- Grill cheese + Chicken club + 2 egg breakfast = 50 $.</li><li>It was full of flavour ( and cheese) and not salt.</li><li>Cottage cheese ?</li><li>The cheese coated the soup perfectly and the onion flavour seeped deliciously through.</li><li>I love the cheese, olives and pickles they give us at the beginning with nice warm soft bread.</li><li>The portion was painfully small, the cheese on top of poor quality and there 's a small piece of bread in there looks like day old baguette.</li><li>My favourites are the butter chicken and palak paneer ( curry spinach and cheese).</li><li>Takoyaki- Generous pieces of octopus in every ball ( six per serving) with the right amount of cheese.</li><li>Anywho, I got the pizza sub, which was warmed up in the microwave and featured old veggies and low quality cheese.</li><li>A foot of carbs, meat and cheese, for about 1/3 of what a movie ticket will run you these days is incredible.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
