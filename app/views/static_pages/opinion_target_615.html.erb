<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 615' %><h2>:<br />occurrence: 7</h2><div><ol><li>Pros: Ginseng Chicken soup that ca n't be found at most Korean restaurants Very well done side dishes Cons: Pricey for a Korean restaurant Not much variety in menu No Gamjatang ??</li><li>Good: sizzling flounder, rock shrimp Okay: fried rice Bad: Any of the ramen dishes.</li><li>Recommendations: Scallop sushi and scallop sashimi Beef ribs ( which are cooked to a very pleasing medium-rare) Herb white tuna sashimi Eggplant tempura Avoid: Sushi Legend fried rice Sake mussel ( dry, tough, over-salted) Crazy dragon roll TL; DR Efficient service, great grill items, simple menu items shine over heavily-seasoned and sauced rolls and entrees.</li><li>Ordered: Coconut Shrimps* 5 pieces of coconut shrimps for $ 9.75* Shrimps were butterflied and deep fried with actual coconut bits in the batter* When it arrived, it was just luke warm* And the sauce looked like it was from McDonalds ( seriously ?)* I was the one who wanted to try them and boy, did I regret ordering these* For $ 10, this was def not worth it Ordered: Lobster Bisque* Small personal lobster bisque for $ 8.95* This was n't very hot either but it was delicious!* It is super creamy and rich with lobster meats* My dad loved this and finished a entire cup himself* It is def not cheap but very much worth it Ordered: Jumbo Garlic Shrimps* 9 jumbo shrimps Butterflied and Baked $ 25.50* If lobster is not your thing, they always have shrimp dishes* They were perfectly cooked and had good flavor with garlic bits* It was kind of on the dry side but with the melted butter it was fine* I just tried one of this and my sister had the rest of it Ordered: 2lb Steamed Lobster &amp; 4lb Broiled Lobster* 2lb lobster was $ 57.00 and 4lb lobster is $ 97.00* You can choose the lobster to be steamed or broiled* I mostly had the broiled 4lb ( obviously shared it with others)* Steamed had much clean taste since no other seasoning was used* Broiled lobster tasted more rich with the crust on top* 4lb lobster was so huge the claw was as big as my face* They get pretty messy to eat so you are given a plastic bib to put around your neck Summary: I walked in not expecting much but I fully enjoyed the meal at The Lobster Trap.</li><li>Bests: Vancouver Ribs were pretty good Worst: Truly terrible `` bbq pork ends'' were not as one would imagine ( ie- chewy sweet sticky end cuts of bbq pork) but rather just diced cubes of pale, tasteless white pork, and most other dishes were also flavorless and disappointing, including the chicken-bacon sticks people rave about!</li><li>Pros: Has lunch specials and dinner specials, food came out quickly, tempura and japchae was yummy Cons: miso soup was too salty, the waitress sat me in a booth and did n't check up on me once the food came, did n't get a water refill, no banchan or kimchi, skimped on the Kalbi for the lunch special If you 're looking for a place in the area that serves Korean food for the same price, your best bet would be the Seoul house on Orfus Rd. You might said I 'm picky but I do n't think I would come back to this place.</li><li>Pros: Butter Chicken is above average Cons: Portions are small Do n't order anything seafood I do n't crave Indian often, so I 'm not a pro when it comes to Indian food.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
