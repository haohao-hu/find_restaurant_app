<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 2887' %><h2>sandwiches rock<br />occurrence: 1</h2><div><ol><li>TOVLI. luckily i work in this neck of the woods, otherwise it would be pretty heroic ( but SO worth it!) to come up here for lunch from downtown! there is another location just south of wilson on bathurst, but i think that 's it. i love falafels, and i think that TOVLI has the best in the city. and yes it 's those sexy falafel sandwiches that i adore ... the falafel balls alone are pretty fabulous, but the sandwiches rock! stuffed full of their salad ( a kind of coleslaw) and your choice of pickled turnips ( my favourite) and such, they are HUGE and wonderful. definitely not for first dates or for in the car, these require 2 hands, lots of napkins and a good appetite!</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
