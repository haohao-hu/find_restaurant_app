<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 180' %><h2>bowl<br />occurrence: 29</h2><div><ol><li>Instead, it 's all in the bowl ( whether you like it or not).</li><li>I did n't add any but I pour a little on my spoon just to make sure it is not sugar Raw Veal Bibimbap $ 12.95 Do n't get scared by the word raw, it will get cooked completely while mixing because the bowl is so hot.</li><li>The bowl is massive and comes with quite a bit of meat in there.</li><li>The bowl was pretty big for a small, and If I remember correctly, it was only 6 $ for the portion of noodles and meat I got.</li><li>The bowl was stacked with meaty goodness ( beef brisket, Hu style pork sausage slices, pork blood).</li><li>The bowl was essentially all soup.</li><li>The bowl was steaming hot, I could smell the lemongrass as the subtle flavors awoken my nostrils as my mouth watered in anticipation of that first bite.</li><li>The hand made noodle had great texture, however, the soup was so hot that it became overcooked by the time I ate half the bowl.</li><li>Boy was I disappointed, I order a bowl of pho with beef and tripe rice noodle soup and when it arrived at the table I thought the bowl was for a child portion.</li><li>The lettuce they used was selected properly in that they were all solid bowl shaped.</li><li>The seafood in the bowl is always tender and never fishy.</li><li>The bowl was huge, definitely enough for 2 or 3 people, and very inexpensive.</li><li>The bowl is huge and could feed a lot of people for that 21.95,, but we ate up the lobster and about half the congee and called it done.</li><li>We had to order a Gam Ja Tang because we were still so hungry, and furthermore, it was the saddest Gam Ja Tang I 've ever seen, with only 2/3 of the bowl filled up ( compared to the overflowing bowl you get at Owl), two small pieces of pork bone, and no potatoes or soup fillers.</li><li>It 's not spicy in the first bite but it creeps up on your as you finish the bowl.</li><li>Hand slapped noodles in my bowl were chewy and widely cut, reminding me of Pappardelle.</li><li>And the bowl was so tiny.</li><li>So good that I was scrapping the bowl when filling the takeout container so I would n't lose a drop.</li><li>She said that when the chef cooked the beef pho, he put all the food left in the pot into our bowl, so medium became large, and because we ate it, we must pay for the large bowl.</li><li>My final tip: crack the raw egg in the bowl immediately the tofu bowl is served, then carefully spoon the molten hot soup over the egg to cook the egg whites but leave the yolk runny.</li><li>Note that if you get take out, they will only give you two side dishes placed into the same bowl: kimchi and the spicy radishes.</li><li>Their pho broth is very delicious and the depending on the bowl itself could usually have a lot of meat in it than it should which could either be good or bad, depending on how you roll.</li><li>Removed battered banana from the bowl, toffee hardens and served.</li><li>Done bowl is sizzling hot and makes the best crispiness in the end.</li><li>I love how the spice is JUST right, and the bowl is big enough for all the pork- unlike some places that have it overflowing.</li><li>Luckily the bowl was n't filled up to the very top.</li><li>I kindly asked her again, if we could have a `` bigger'' bowl to put our bones in.</li><li>You pile up your bowl and then give it to the person at the grill and they will cook it for you right there.</li><li>The price was decent: 10 bucks for a bowl I could n't finish so I felt good about it.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
