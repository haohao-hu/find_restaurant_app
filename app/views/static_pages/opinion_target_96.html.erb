<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 96' %><h2>lettuce<br />occurrence: 58</h2><div><ol><li>Whenever I call to them about my issues they never really seem to apologize, rather blame it on me; `` you did not tell me no sunflower seeds'' ( i did) `` do n't leave the salad in the car or the veggies get brown'' ( i never do) `` my chef forgot to put in the carrots, I will give you extra next time'' ( I watched her make my salad, not a chef &amp; my salad literally had lettuce, cheese and 4 mandarin oranges in it).</li><li>For the garnishes I chose lettuce, parsley &amp; tomatoes.</li><li>The garden salad is a hit with me, I worship anyone capable of throwing tasty home made dressing together, the lettuce is crispy fresh as are other ingredients which makes for an uplifting combination with the dressing.</li><li>The only thing that was not great were the fries, they were mushy because if the way the container is designed and the lettuce in the salad was turning red ( stale).</li><li>In the sandwich, they add lettuce, tomato, mayo, mustard on a kaiser bun.</li><li>The guys behind the counter here are pretty generous with the amount of rice, vegetables ( e.g. lettuce, pickel, onions, beets), and chicken they pile on your plate.</li><li>Look to pay about $ 6 for a delicious chicken shawarma, complete with mostly fresh toppings ( the lettuce was slightly wilted and a little brown each time I went).</li><li>I ordered up a Chicken Shawarma with all the fixins ( garlic, hummus, lettuce, tomatoes, tahini, and extra hot sauce).</li><li>And sexy summer rolls are the non-fried ones- they have avocado, lettuce, crab or shrimp, other greenery and come wrapped in a see through rice paper. yummmmzeeerrrzzzzz The staff at the Sheppard and Yonge location are super nice.</li><li>The pita was soggy, the toppings were n't fresh- lettuce was wilted and very old looking.</li><li>Caesar salad properly balances fresh, cool dry lettuce and clingy garlic-charged dressing.</li><li>Portion was quite tiny though- they covered most of it with lettuce, which was a bit odd.</li><li>She vouched for the sushi set lunch but I was royally disappointed when I asked for the vegetable maki set ( $ 9.95) and they gave me giant maki rolls filled with ... ugh, lettuce.</li><li>My salad, was ok, but how do you fail a salad ? forget the lettuce ?</li><li>For today 's review, let 's go with the bullet point format: Negatives:- Greek Salad is simply green lettuce with Feta Cheese sprinkled on it ( Kidding right ?</li><li>The Nacho burger had a six oz patty ( you could choose a whole wheat or white bun) topped with guacamole, tomato salsa, lettuce, cheddar cheese and jalapeno sour cream.</li><li>Even the good lettuce and tomato cannot save the burger portion.</li><li>One bite I tasted mushy flavorless refried beans, another bite, dry and tastless lettuce.</li><li>The lettuce was all over the place and sour cream was placed right on top of the lettuce instead of with the meat.</li><li>The vermicelli also has the perfect balance between the noodles, lettuce, pickled cucumber and carrot.</li><li>It 's a pita wrap filled with chicken shawarma and your choice of lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, green olives, hot peppers, and some others.</li><li>I had a pozole ( spicey stewed pork, corn soup), it was a good portion as it came with a fried tortilla with sour cream, and all the condiments to put into the soup ( radish, lettuce, oregano, cayenne pepper powder, onions) my husband had the combo which came with an enchilada, a burrito, and refried beans in a taco basket.</li><li>The lettuce was the best part of it, totally!</li><li>A Caesar salad had lettuce that was reasonably fresh but appeared to be sliced with a knife rather than torn and cheap tasting dressing that seemed like the kind that comes out of those little plastic packages at fast food restaurants.</li><li>Side dishes: lettuce, bean sprouts, kimchii, sweet radish, kimchii flavored radish and peanuts with little dried fish The meal was good but nothing really stood out for me.</li><li>I think it 's the kitchen/deli staff that needs management, they distracted our server few times, and than served sandwiches with stale lettuce and tomatoes.</li><li>I do n't know about anyone but i like my cheese melted on my eggs. just picture this sandwich: dry cold egg, on warm bagel, with stale lettuce and tomatoes, between cheese and egg, with no sauce or butter or anything that would make the sandwich stick together, beside the juice from the runny old tomatoes.</li><li>I was expecting a very light, crispy salad ( I imagine baby lettuce and spinach and tomatoes and other crunchy watery things would complement the pomelo well ...) but what I got was lettuce with pomelo and SHRIMP ( !!) with some sort of peanut-cinnamon sauce, and hot peppers.</li><li>The salad is chopped, tasteless lettuce, with half a styrofoamy tomato on top, and your choice of Kraft dressing.</li><li>The lettuce they used was selected properly in that they were all solid bowl shaped.</li><li>The lettuce wrap was delicious- the lettuce was fresh and the filling was perfectly seasoned.</li><li>There were four of us, some Chinese and non- Chinese We ordered ONE two course Whole BBQ duck ( presented and carved duck in very thin slices at the table, comes with crepes ( ?) and stir fried duck meat with lettuce) FYI: you make a wrap, sliced duck with crepe or stir fried duck with lettuce, One Chinese style chow mein One shrimp fried rice One Chinese broccoli with garlic sauce And tea The hostess informed us it will take 20 mintues for the duck.</li><li>For $ 45 the meal came with the beef sirloin, two bowls of purple rice, lettuce wrap, seasoned lettuce, onion pancake, an assortment of 8 side dishes and a bowl of seafood soon tofu soup.</li><li>It 's a meal for two with lots of meat, lettuce, soon tofu soup, and rice.</li><li>Pork Belly BBQ ~ That 's the only type of BBQ that you can enjoy indoor year round in Canada, this is cook at the table. ~ It usually comes with lettuce, bean sauce, raw garlic slices and rice which you could make your own lettuce wrap with. ~ You 'll hear a lot of people going ewww when they hear raw garlic slices but trust me, it taste perfect with the meat and sauce here.</li><li>You also get a separate plate or container for salad which you can help yourself- the salad is quite plain though about 95% lettuce or you can take coleslaw or cheap pasta salad.</li><li>The lettuce was crisp ( void of brown spots), the tomatoes were fresh, the salsa was flavourful ( though spicy is not so spicy), and the cheese smelled and tasted just fine.</li><li>The standard burrito build is rice, your choice of re-fried or black beans, grilled veggies ( mixed peppers and onions mostly), mild or medium sauce, both tomato and corn salsas, cheese, lettuce and sour cream.</li><li>The cesaer salad that I loved was way too salty and the lettuce was old.</li><li>The food was meh ... the garden salad was pretty gross as the lettuce used was obvi old.</li><li>My co-worker seemed to enjoy her salmon salad, and it did look pretty fresh ( at least the lettuce did, I 'm not experienced with smoked salmon to make that observation).</li><li>One time my Gf and I did table cooking and lettuce, to get more lettuce we had to pay more ...</li><li>One time my Gf and I did table cooking and lettuce, to get more lettuce we had to pay more ...</li><li>The salad was absolutely divine! ( And I never thought I 'd use that word to describe lettuce!)</li><li>Wide assortment of toppings such as lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, pickles, cucumbers, black olives, jalapenos, hot peppers and tons of sauces to choose from.</li><li>Huge improvement from the disgusting lettuce and mayo filled burgers at McDonald 's and Burger King.</li><li>Wrap that in lettuce, put some condiments, a Korean taco!</li><li>You grill the meat, wrap it in lettuce, put some bean paste .... A-OK, nothing really wowed me.</li><li>The BBQ was delicious, the lettuce was fresh and clean and the banchan more and better than other restaurants.</li><li>I chose to have mine over rice but lettuce was also provided if you wished to prepare a wrap, of sorts.</li><li>The lettuce is very fresh and the Rainbow chop does not disappoint me.</li><li>Then it 's sandwiched betwen a brioche bun with cheddar cheese, bacon, onion straws, lettuce, tomato, and garlic dill sauce.</li><li>Some memorable dishes for me:- the blanched SPINACH SALAD starter- super palate cleansing- SASHIMI NIGIRI- did n't check/could n't figure out what fish these were, but so buttery fresh. rice was very appropriately sized to the fish portion- SASHIMI LETTUCE ROLLS- seeing shredded lettuce wrapped within my sashimi felt weird to me, but it did help pick up some extra of the ponzu-type dressing so that it was adequately saucy- BAKED OYSTER- diced and baked with a cream sauce, topped with cheese and baked in the giant shell.</li><li>Interesting but the lettuce stuffing was odd.</li><li>I ordered the Wimpy 's Club which had bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayo and chicken breast on white bread.</li><li>The lettuce is shredded, bread is soft and fresh, and condiments are terrific.</li><li>Food- 5/5 Service- take out but 5/5 Ambiance- 2/5 Price to value ratio: 4.5/5 soft bread, crispy bacons, shredded crispy lettuce, huge size .. very good price, for such a nice sandwich, turkey bacon is my favorite, it going to be a regular lunch place for me for sure!</li><li>The bread is amazing, the lettuce is better, the meat is way better, they put like 10ibs of bacon on the turkey bacon, and it 's GOOD bacon ...</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
