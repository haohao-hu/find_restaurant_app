<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 252' %><h2>selection<br />occurrence: 22</h2><div><ol><li>DRINKS: The selection is lacking.</li><li>The selection was awesome- we opted for 2 maki and temaki sets ( A &amp; C), and the Tiger Roll ( Tuna, Avocado, Cream Cheese, wrapped in Salmon).</li><li>This location, a little smaller than the others, has the usual great selection- staff who are trying their best to ensure they 're giving good service, and of course, the child play pen.</li><li>The selection is okay, but the maki rolls need work as they are not very good.</li><li>They only have street parking and there 's always parking officer roaming that street. they have a full wine/sake/soju selection and i get the impression that the staff are not quite knowledgeable. ive ordered beef sashimi, and chicken katsu in the past but i dont think that the quality is anything worth trying.</li><li>What do you get when you combine good prices, good selection, and good food ?</li><li>Although they have a different and pricier menu than their first location Salad King ( Yonge/Dundas), the selection is wonderful- and they will happily make you something off of Salad King 's menu if you ask for it.</li><li>The selection is small but what they serve, they do well.</li><li>The selection is pretty standard, but the prices were fair.</li><li>The selection is abundant.</li><li>Food: The selection is pretty standard, a lot of fish balls, vegetables, lamb, beef slices and a seafood option that includes 1/2 lobster.</li><li>Good menu selection as well with dishes in the $ 10 ~ $ 15 range, I love that they have a brunch menu for the weekends!</li><li>Their menu selection is larger than average so you 're very likely to find what you 're looking for.</li><li>There is not much to read anyway, the selection is kind of limited.</li><li>Let 's just say not much of a selection.</li><li>The selection is huge and the food is fresh and well presented.</li><li>1 table long of selection ranging from breaded shrimp, goat curry, noodles, fried rice, chicken wings, sweet and sour chicken, vegetable spring rolls, Bbq chicken and watermelon.</li><li>Great selection, service was fantastic, wonderful atmosphere.</li><li>The selection offered is that not extensive, and I guess that they have reduced it to accommodate the ' mongolian' part of the operation.</li><li>Food: well-prepared, good selection There is both the buffet area as well as the Mongolian grill area.</li><li>I thought the selection was great.</li><li>The selection is great and tastes amazing, but I always end up eating the butter chicken and naan only.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
