<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 402' %><h2>potato latte<br />occurrence: 12</h2><div><ol><li>The only disappointment was that the sweet potato latte was lacking in taste.</li><li>As for food, I ordered the rice cake bingsoo and a white hot chocolate and my friend also ordered a sweet potato latte.</li><li>It 's still a cute place to hang out w/ friends though. service, food, everything was great--especially the atmosphere. super cosy and easily my ( and many of my friends ') favourite cafe in the area try out the cinnamon honey brick bread and their bingsoo! this is the only cafe so far in toronto that serves shaved milk ( instead of regular water which makes it extra creamy and delicious). their servings are always very large so going with a friend is recommended but not necessary. if you 're looking for drinks, their sweet potato latte is the best I 've had in toronto and as for cold drinks, all of their bubble teas are very nice would definitely recommend to try out for anyone in the area.</li><li>Sweet potato latte ( 3/5): This is probably the only miss I 've had at this place.</li><li>Maybe I 'm just not a big fan of the sweet potato latte but it tasted like sweet milk to me with a slight sweet potato flavouring.</li><li>As an avid sweet potato fan, I ordered the regular sweet potato latte ( $ 5) and a sweet potato crepe ( $ 9) to share.</li><li>The sweet potato latte was everything sweet potato I could imagine.</li><li>Tried a sip of the sweet potato latte as well and it definitely had a very strong and distinct sweet potato flavour.</li><li>I always order their sweet potato latte which never disappoints me.</li><li>I had the matcha green tea ice cream and crepe and sweet potato latte and they 're all extremely good.</li><li>Lunch special: pick from a list of crepes ( sweet or savory) and a hot beverage ( all other drinks + $ 1) = $ 10.99 I opted for chicken crepe with an iced sweet potato latte ( + $ 1).</li><li>Lastly, I got a hot sweet potato latte.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
