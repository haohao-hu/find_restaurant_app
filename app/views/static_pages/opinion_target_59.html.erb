there literally is no decorations in this restaurant.</li><li>Overall, the restaurant was clean but a little cramped ( eaves dropping is very easy [ [ well because the tables are close together and the customers do tend to be LOUD ] ]).</li><li>Situated in a plaza with a few other Vietnamese shops, this restaurant is a star!</li><li>I 've been to quite a number of Korean restaurants in Toronto, and I can honestly say this restaurant does Korean food really well.</li><li>Considering this restaurant was n't full for a Saturday night- so that 's a signal as to the kind of service you are going to get.</li><li>Overall, this restaurant is your standard Chinese restaurant--fully equipped with the usual pearly white utensils and chopsticks--and the prices are cheap and affordable!</li><li>The restaurant is nice ( and not dirty), the service is fast, they open late, the food is great and the price is right.</li><li>Pros: Amazing food, fast service, clean, and very cheap Cons: Can be pretty busy at lunch ... but I guess that 's an indicator that people really love this restaurant Recommendations: Congee- all of them are amazing General Tao Chicken- I 'm Filipino/Canadian and you know we love GT chicken!</li><li>The veal parmigiana is excellent, although it does n't come with very much sauce, so it is dry and even when you ask for extra extra extra extra sauce you still only get just a touch more. if you are in the area and looking for a great Italian restaurant I would definitely come here and check Rossini out for yourself.</li><li>This restaurant is like someone going through the motions without any care- both the food and the service.</li><li>This restaurant is a hole in the wall kind of place, and I realized that it 's one of the places I 've walked by so many times and never really noticed.</li><li>Would have given it a five star if the restaurant was nice.</li><li>I 've tried places with their crab fried rice and its always good but I did notice that this restaurant does n't get stingy when it comes to putting the crab in your rice !!</li><li>Came here on a frosty evening craving for something hot and stewy and this restaurant definitely hit the spot!</li><li>The restaurant is a bit hidden away on Drewry and Yonge in an area filled with your choice of Korean eats.</li><li>The staff is friendly, the restaurant is nice, and the food is good too.</li><li>This is a nice Italian restaurant, personally I do n't know why everyone else is giving bad reviews, I guess they just do n't know good food when they see it!</li><li>When a restaurant has a small menu like this restaurant, one expects awesome food.</li><li>The restaurant is on the pricier side, but it definitely worth extra money.</li><li>The restaurant had a nice ambience and our server was pleasent.</li><li>Definitely over priced and we 'll never recommend this restaurant to anybody unless they improve.</li><li>On a positive, the restaurant was pretty quiet for a Thursday lunch crowd ( which I like), not packed which was surprising.</li><li>The restaurant was not busy, so there is no excuse for that tardiness w/ a bored bartender.</li><li>Anyway, should n't be a problem for most people though as it seems like this restaurant is more catered to a western demographic.</li><li>For lamb meat lovers, this restaurant is heaven on earth.</li><li>For all you can eat, this restaurant is great because unlike other all you can eats they forget your order ( on purpose ? lol).</li><li>The restaurant is clean and has a few tables but I suspect, most of the business is take-out.</li><li>So in conclusion, this restaurant just was n't my cup of tea.</li><li>The restaurant is a mom and pop style type place that tries to give the feel of being at a wharf.</li><li>I have never left a restaurant feeling so disrespected after spending over $ 50 a person on what was passable food quality.</li><li>This restaurant was always busy and I have been meaning to give it a try.</li><li>I 'm giving this restaurant 4 stars based on the following criteria: taste, affordability and quantity The food always comes out fast, hot ( not like at Spring Rolls !!) and fresh.</li><li>The restaurant is a little small but as a big guy I was still able to get around the seat comfortably.</li><li>The restaurant was clean and very nice.</li><li>They said no. In my head, I 'm wondering ' what kind of restaurant does n't have knives ?!' ( Side rant) I ended up just biting of it and then giving it to my friend after haha.</li><li>Having tasted the same stuff in Xi' an, I had high expectations but this restaurant met all of them.</li><li>This restaurant is a big chain and I would say its consistent to the other ones I have been too.</li><li>The restaurant is a nice space.</li><li>This restaurant does n't really specialize in korean bbq, but they certainly did have a couple options on the menu for it.</li><li>Garbage restaurant.</li><li>Apparently to him, this restaurant was n't that great from a Korean perspective, so just something to keep in mind.</li><li>The restaurant is outdated.</li><li>The restaurant is pretty small but we got lucky and did n't have to wait long for a table of 6.</li><li>The restaurant is always quite busy but you never have to really wait for a table unless you have a large group.</li><li>I like this restaurant because there broth is delicious.</li><li>The table also had wine and little carafes of vodka that we had purchased earlier and given to the restaurant earlier in the day.</li><li>The restaurant is clean and well maintained ( they renovated it about a year ago and it looks great!).</li><li>I really do n't like this restaurant.</li><li>Well it was good, its not all you can eat and kinda on the pricier side but nice for dinner for 2 The restaurant was clean and the service was great.</li><li>In terms of decor and general ambience, the restaurant does n't provide you with anything particularly noteworthy.</li><li>The restaurant itself was very small and they must have had a very tiny budget for decor.</li><li>If you have n't tried this restaurant already, you 're missing out!</li><li>Whenever it 's cold out, this restaurant is the first place I think of:).</li><li>I mean, this restaurant does n't serve much other than their house specialty.</li><li>This restaurant needs a lot of improvement and new management!</li><li>The restaurant is open 24 hours and is consistently busy.</li><li>The restaurant is in dire need of a facelift, the oldness makes it look dirty even though I think the place is pretty clean.</li><li>I always remember this place as a 4.5 star restaurant .. been coming here for years and years and years.</li><li>I recommend this restaurant to everyone.</li><li>CONCLUSION: Customer service is a distinguishing factor in today 's competitive environment and this restaurant does n't cut it.</li><li>The restaurant itself was small, so I would n't go in with a group larger than 4.</li><li>I kept getting whiffs of stinky

pretty place with yellow sponged walls.</li><li>The thing that surprised me is that not only does this restaurant have Persian food, it has a bit of the Arabic food touch and Italian dishes like pastas and pizzas.</li><li>Overall, this restaurant is delicious and has a something for everyone.</li><li>First off, this restaurant was advertised as Malaysian/Thai ...</li><li>It used to be a very nice neighbourhood restaurant ...</li><li>The restaurant was not even that busy.</li><li>With its small entrance tucked in the corner amid many other attention grabbing visuals, this restaurant could be easily bypassed just by virtue of being nearly invisible.</li><li>( Inner Susan C.* facepalm*) Pro:- good dim sum- fast- clean, spacious restaurant- Just off the 404 on Finch Con- They 're not always sure which dishes go to which table- On the higher end in terms of prices- Parking bites- No push carts giving you a look see.</li><li>The atmosphere was nice but the restaurant was pretty dead on the Monday night we were there.</li><li>I do n't think this restaurant need any star!</li><li>This restaurant is a nice surprise!</li><li>In my humble opinion, this restaurant needs a Menu makeover

10 hours before I stepped in: P The restaurant is a little bit small since they have no window, but service was remarkable.</li><li>This restaurant is a sister restaurant of Pearl Harbourfront Chinese Cuisine There are 3 rows of tables- the rectangular tables on one side with sofa, the large table for family in the middle and the small tables on the other side.</li><li>The restaurant is pretty petite, but service was quick and friendly and we were out in under an hour so that was great.</li><li>The restaurant is a bit on the smaller side, but very nicely decorated.</li><li>The restaurant is

lacking at all, even though the restaurant was plenty busy at noon on a Saturday.</li><li>This restaurant is a treasure.</li><li>My friends and I ( 5 of us) decided to have some Korean food here cuz apparently this restaurant is kinda popular ( and you have to wait in line at 9pm), it turns out the food is really mediocre here.</li><li>The restaurant is clean and our server, Rosita was very friendly and eager.</li><li>The restaurant was maybe 25% full ?</li><li>Although the restaurant is n't as aesthically pleasing, the food speaks wonders.</li><li>Well, this restaurant was like the '
