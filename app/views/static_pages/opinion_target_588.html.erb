<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 588' %><h2>stuff<br />occurrence: 6</h2><div><ol><li>The stuff is very professional and friendly.</li><li>The special rolls were nice ( ordered mango tango, crazy dragon, black dragon, soft shell crab) but then they fill you up quite quickly so I suggest to fill up on the good stuff ( sashimi and such) first before getting too much of the rolls.</li><li>And because they have so much traffic, their stuff is always fresh!</li><li>We had a nice dinner with the kids The ribs are great and worth the price Side orders are a bit pricy for the size they are serving Overall good food with friendly stuff Worth the price On Friday we stopped by to grab some apps between hockey games at chestwood arena.</li><li>You can also get bulgogi and bibimbap but the really good stuff is the tofu soup.</li><li>About food .... ...............:)) we did n't go home hungry with the $ 85 menu.:)) The stuff was good .. no complains about them .... But the worst part of the day was, party started when we were about to leave.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
