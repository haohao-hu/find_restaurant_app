I both had teriyaki ( beef &amp; salmon) &amp; the vegetables that came with were so salty.</li><li>The salad is a fresh difference from other sushi places due to the variety of vegetables used.</li><li>Sisig had strange texture to it, crispy pata was n't that great, and the chinese style vegetables was plain ridiculous with the size of bokchoy they used.</li><li>I only deducted 0.5 because the soup is sometimes on the salty side and the eggs they give you are extra tiny! `` everyone knows, when you go to Buk Chang 's, it 's for the soon tofu. unless you have a serious aversion to the texture of silk, do as the locals do and order one of the gloriously smooth tofu soups. they are THE BEST in the city! although, soon tofu is sometimes referred to as stew, it 's more like a light, flavourful broth with pieces of vegetables, tofu, and sometimes meat. it 's served piping hot, and in my opinion, best eaten in the colder months. hints: parking is in the back alley nearby subway is finch station, head south 2 blocks see jimi 's review of the toronto location at: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/buk-chang-dong-soon-tofu-toronto.</li><li>The tofu soup is so good with plenty of vegetables and tofu.</li><li>The meat comes pre-seasoned and and the vegetables are drenched in soy sauce and salted garlic butter.</li><li>Sausage dish was terrible and the vegetables were even worse.</li><li>It is quite savoury and besides the meat, the soup has potato, vegetables, and perilla seeds.</li><li>I had the JeYukBokeum ( stir fried marinated pork with spicy sauce on sizzling plate) and my boyfriend tried the Dolsot BiBimBap ( vegetables and ground beef with rice in a hot stone bowl).</li><li>The pork was really flavorful, served with a generous amount of vegetables ( green peppers and onions).</li><li>The BBB was I thought not very tasty, all the vegetables tasted roughly the same with the buttery taste, and overall the dish was mediocre.</li><li>As your side, you can pick from fries or veggie sticks/ vegetables but once you choose one though, you cannot change it for subsequent wing orders.</li><li>We ordered pork dumplings in soup, beef and vegetable meal, wonton soup, vsteamed vegetables and seafood basket.</li><li>It 's more like a sad platter of a few soggy vegetables hiding a potato party underneath.</li><li>The vegetables were crisp.</li><li>I never knew how bad bibimbap could be until you tasted slimy vegetables from the cucumber.</li><li>I 'm not sure if it is because the cook ( doubtful a chef would work there) did not wash and dry the vegetables properly, but it just tasted slimy.</li><li>Unlike other pork bone soups I 've had this one did not have any seeds in it ( not sure what those seeds are but they sure taste good) nor did it have any green vegetables, I enjoy a little greenery in my soup and this was sorely missed.</li><li>The chicken came already cooked with the vegetables and all we did was stir it occasionally for it not to burn.</li><li>Although there were a variety of vegetables ( green beans, carrots, etc.), they were covered in an excess of oil.</li><li>Found the knife work to be a bit lazy as vegetables and meat pieces were not very uniform and some were way too big.</li><li>However, it was quite tender and the vegetables were savoury as well.</li><li>It came with a baked potato and vegetables, which were good but nothing to rave about.</li><li>All 3 were quite good with the snails being the most interesting ( roasted on a slice of roasted eggplant, hint of blue cheese), the main being the most satisfying ( sliced of tenderloin with a nice sauce and vegetables and the desert rounding things out ( 7 kinds of chocolate ... need I say more ?) ...</li><li>The mashed potatoes that came along was great, and so were the vegetables.</li><li>The proteins and vegetables are not bad though I wished they would give you more portion wise.</li><li>Generous portions of meat &amp; vegetables cooked at your table with a little bit of entertainment.</li><li>Moving on to the main course, vegetables were n't bad.</li><li>Foodwise, the quality of the meats and vegetables were unmistakably top grade, and cooked well. p.s. you need to pay for parking, with a $ 2 discount off your bill when you provide the ticket stub.</li><li>Their vegetables are also good for the most part.</li><li>Poached Choy sum item was just regular vegetables not choy sum as advertised.</li><li>The latter 3 dishes all had the same vegetables, just different main ingredient.</li><li>They have a great selection of vegetables, meat, tofu and condiments.</li><li>You walk around with a bowl, place in some meat, vegetables, sauces, garnishes, etc and pass it to a chef who takes your bowl and cooks it all on a HUGE table stove in front of you in a minute and passes it right back to you.</li><li>For those of you that do n't know, the way you eat at the Mongolian Grill is to fill an empty bowl with all sorts of raw meats, vegetables, sauces and spices and the cooks there will stir fry it before your very eyes.</li><li>Then you get in this line where you pick your meat ( choice of lamb, beef, chicken or pork), then you pick your vegetables, then noodles then whatever sauce you want.</li><li>A lot of choices, vegetables and meat are fresh.</li><li>Lots of meats, vegetables, noodles, and sauces.</li><li>The DIY stir fry section has a great variety of fresh meats, vegetables, and sauces.</li><li>The vegetables shrink after it is grilled, the way to do it is bring 2 bowls with you otherwise you 'll have to line up again.</li><li>We decided to order the supreme super bowl congee, cantonese chow mein, three kinds stuffed vegetables ( eggplant, tofu and green pepper), minced pork and dried fish green beans and fried chili turnip patties.</li><li>Love their Cantonese Chow Mein with big shrimps, tender chicken slices &amp; fresh mix vegetables.</li><li>There was a good variety of vegetables inside the soup broth and it 's a great step up from the Netsu.</li><li>I believe it was a miso base with pork and vegetables.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
