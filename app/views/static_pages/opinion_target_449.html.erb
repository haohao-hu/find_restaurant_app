<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 449' %><h2>Food portions<br />occurrence: 10</h2><div><ol><li>Food portions were TINY and prices are high ... ( i speak of the ala carte menu not AYCE) came in on a near empty Wednesday night ... promptly seated .. then that was it .. they litterally just forgot about us .. no tea no menu .. they just went to the back and dissapeared for a good 13 minutes or so .. cant even wave anyone down. when we finally got the menu, anything remotely resembling a deal cannot be used with the groupon ... ( ALL bento boxes) so i ordered a chirashi.</li><li>The food portions are great considering it 's a buffet.</li><li>Their flavours wo n't disappoint you either. c: Did I mention food portions are really generous ?</li><li>All in all I think this place has potential but really needs to improve on the cleanliness, service and the food portions.</li><li>Great food portions and Price.</li><li>Like the soup, the food portions are huge and the restaurant does not skimp on ingredients.</li><li>( Although I have to complement the people they have for doing their best to keep things running smoothly, our server this time was great)- The food portions are a smaller than they used to be, including for items like fries and coleslaw.</li><li>Food portions were far from generous.</li><li>Regardless, food portions are great, and prices for their all day menu is more than reasonable.</li><li>Food portions were quite large but quality of food on the low scale.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
