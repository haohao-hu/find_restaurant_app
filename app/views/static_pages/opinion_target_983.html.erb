<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 983' %><h2>dimsum<br />occurrence: 3</h2><div><ol><li>It was not great but awful.- clear skin chive and shrimp dimpling: okay. no complaint here.- black bean spare ribs: extremely salty but very tasty- deep fried squid tentacles: it did n't taste all the fresh because the whole thing was just not al dente enough. it should be less chewy and more rubbery. flavour was okay- garlic baby bok choy: a `` Special'' dish that was over $ 5 with fairly small portion. it was done VERY well though. best dish probably- custard bun: way too much flour and the custard was not dense at all.- singapore vermicelli: good, no complaints Overall, the food was decent, not the greatest dimsum but it satiates the craving, any time of the day.</li><li>Some faves include the prime rib, crab legs ( cold better than hot), spicy chicken, bbq pork ribs, wings, dimsum, fried fish w Tartar, scallop cutlets, the hot waffles with strawberries and whipped cream, the macaroons, and the creme brulee for dessert.</li><li>The food came fast and was decently fresh- dimsum was steaming hot, but our cold noodles were stuck together ( maybe left out too long ?).</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
