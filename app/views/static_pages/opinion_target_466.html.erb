<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 466' %><h2>pickled turnips<br />occurrence: 10</h2><div><ol><li>TOVLI. luckily i work in this neck of the woods, otherwise it would be pretty heroic ( but SO worth it!) to come up here for lunch from downtown! there is another location just south of wilson on bathurst, but i think that 's it. i love falafels, and i think that TOVLI has the best in the city. and yes it 's those sexy falafel sandwiches that i adore ... the falafel balls alone are pretty fabulous, but the sandwiches rock! stuffed full of their salad ( a kind of coleslaw) and your choice of pickled turnips ( my favourite) and such, they are HUGE and wonderful. definitely not for first dates or for in the car, these require 2 hands, lots of napkins and a good appetite!</li><li>They also did n't have the pickled turnips I really like.</li><li>They started us with pink pickled turnips which I thought opened up our palettes.</li><li>What you should expect is things like: felafels, shwarma, baba gannoush, pickled turnips.</li><li>But the best is their pickled turnips !!</li><li>The best part is they give you tons and tons of pickled turnips !!</li><li>I love pickled turnips, I think no falafel is complete without a pink pickled turnip inside to tantalize your tastebuds and warm your insides to satisfy your desire for the perfect falafel. ( yes I take my food seriously!).</li><li>The falafels were the best part of the meal, they were large in size, so crunchy on the outside but nice and fluffy on the inside, they were seasoned well ( went great with some tahini sauce and the complimentary pickled turnips).</li><li>I ca n't believe it, but totally worth going back, especially for those pickled turnips.</li><li>Amazing Greek salad and pickled turnips!</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
