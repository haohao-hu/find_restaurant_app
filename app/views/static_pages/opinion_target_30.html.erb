flavor).</li><li>Love their options: lightly dusted ( makes the wings more crispy), non-dusted for those who like crispy chicken skin, boneless, naked with sauce on the side and sauced and grilled (

wings.</li><li>My only word of advice to anyone that orders wings from here is to make sure you inspect your food carefully as apparently `` hairy looking cartilage'' on your wings is a regular thing

skewer- biased, I love chicken wings The sushi was fine, but nothing really jumped out at me.</li><li>The food is good and there are a lot of good points and must tries to this AYCE:- scallop sashimi ( it was quite delicious and fresh)- beef tataki ( although I was n't a fan of it)- gui ling gao ( in the dessert menu- not something I 've seen at other AYCE places)- takoyaki tastes really good ( the flavour is on point!)- grilled squid ( reminded me of night markets, it was very tasty, was n't too chewy at all)- grilled eggplant ( there 's a sweet sauce and it is grilled nicely)- chicken wing skewers ( they 're so good!, the wings are skewed on so the bones are pushed down)- pop is included in the menu ( so no extra charge for all you pop lovers!)</li><li>We ordered the kare kare, pancit sampuguita and half portion of the wings.</li><li>We also came to try the Curry Chicken wings because a coworker of mine had mentioned how great they were.</li><li>I think ...) love this pizza place!

good.</li><li>We ordered two An gus burgers ( $ 5 each) and a pound of wings ( $ 11).</li><li>The wings were very smokey and salty.</li><li>The daily specials are great with the best specials being on Tuesday ( 1/2 off wings) Wednesday ( $ 5 pints and burger) &amp; Thursday ( 1/2 off starters).</li><li>Their famous wings are average IMO.</li><li>I 'm no wing expert, but I know the difference
