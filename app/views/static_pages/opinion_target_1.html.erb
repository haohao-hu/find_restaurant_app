<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1' %><h2>food<br />occurrence: 5124</h2><div><ol><li>Staff are always extremely friendly and attentive and food comes very quickly, no matter how busy it is, although I usually go at lunch on weekdays so it is not overly busy.</li><li>I will continue to come back here as the prices are very reasonable, the service is amazing, and the food is always delicious!</li><li>What 's unforgiveable is that their food turns out worse than mine.</li><li>If I only going review Dr Deli and the Salad Queen based solely on the food ...</li><li>As such, I feel like the quality of the food has gone down over the past few years.</li><li>The food does come quickly, but expect the server to disappear after you 've been brought your food, and possibly not visit for the duration of the meal.</li><li>Dr. Deli is a great place for healthy food.</li><li>Ever since the place was sold this summer, the service and food quality have nose dived.</li><li>Food was very good.</li><li>We waited over an hour for the food.</li><li>Alas, the food arrived.</li><li>We were told the kitchen could redo the order but after waiting over an hour for the food, we just took what the young man brought.</li><li>Needless to say, most of the food went back to the kitchen.</li><li>I saw the nuggets in the food container by the cook 's window sitting there, unattended.</li><li>Who knows what she would 've done with the food.</li><li>The food is of average quality but the prices are good and the service is fast.</li><li>The food used to be much better.</li><li>Every other day, for nearly 6 years, I walked by Cuisine of India and never really paid it much attention until people who lived no where nearby started recommending it. then i began to notice that lux cars were always parked there; it 's one of the only places around this subway travellers ' strip with a parking lot in front of the restaurant. and, as far as I can tell, it 's free to park. but certainly there 's more than the parking that caused these commuters from other parts of the city to rave about Cuisine of India. driving is one thing, but in this weather, i wondered,' is it worth walking ? ' so, i rallied my girlfriends living nearby to see just why commuters from other parts of the city were flocking. we got the impression that few local residents ever visited, since the host quizically looked at us ( the group of asian girls) when we entered and waited to be seated. after establishing that, indeed, we were there to eat, yes, food from Cuisine of India, the service was attentive, patient, and warm. the a la carte portions at Cuisine of India are small, and yet incredibly rich. so you can sample a few and be full, without getting a food baby. unfortunately, i do n't remember the names of the dishes we tried, but i recall that the curried cauliflower dish was very well-spiced, without being spicy. the naan are excellent, as are the spicy cracker-like flatbreads. the latter are served while you wait for your meal and the heat really does hit after a few nibbles, so pace yourself as you wait for your meal.</li><li>This restaurant is located in a small foodcourt in the basement of 5700 Yonge St. There were about 4 hot food choices as well as a sandwich and salad station.</li><li>They have small paper for you to order dimsum ( 2.75 for a small) and a menu for regular food.</li><li>It was not great but awful.- clear skin chive and shrimp dimpling: okay. no complaint here.- black bean spare ribs: extremely salty but very tasty- deep fried squid tentacles: it did n't taste all the fresh because the whole thing was just not al dente enough. it should be less chewy and more rubbery. flavour was okay- garlic baby bok choy: a `` Special'' dish that was over $ 5 with fairly small portion. it was done VERY well though. best dish probably- custard bun: way too much flour and the custard was not dense at all.- singapore vermicelli: good, no complaints Overall, the food was decent, not the greatest dimsum but it satiates the craving, any time of the day.</li><li>The restaurant is clean, quiet, small and has a more serene feeling to it than regular Chinese restaurants, but the food is just as good.</li><li>What it lacks in size makes up in the overall service and food quality.</li><li>The food was INCREDIBLY good ... amazing, in fact.</li><li>I would give the food 5 stars but I 'm bringing my rating down to 3 stars because I thought it was expensive when you factor in the portion sizes and the fact that the decor is kind of ghetto.</li><li>Moreover .... they seem to have a permanent problem with their electric supply ... everytime I have ever been there ( I have been there a lot!) their lights are continually flickering ... annoying and funny at the same time ... food is fabulous.</li><li>The food was abysmal.</li><li>Service was pretty good, prices a little high, and food quality was pretty decent.</li><li>Great service, great price, fantastic food, fava beans were incredible and chicken is moist and delicious.</li><li>Over all good food.</li><li>The food was excellent ( I must admit I was a bit surprised given the look of the restaurant from the Mall).</li><li>The food is good, but VERY oily.</li><li>My experiences always reflected the previous reviews below, poor service and average food.</li><li>It is a small, fast food Asian style eatery that is free of potentious decor or service but is pretty good at what it does.</li><li>The service was exceptional, however the food ... was questionable.</li><li>Questioning whether this place actually sold food, I asked the lady at the counter `` Donde esta la carne ?''</li><li>There was only one lady making the food when we got there just before noon.</li><li>Did n't really like their food.</li><li>The food here is pretty good.</li><li>I 've only gone during lunch, which is pretty quiet ( we 're usually the only table), but that is better for us because the food is super fresh ..</li><li>Service is ok, but considering we 're the only patrons, I 'd expect a little more. just to let you know we drive all the way from Brampton, just to go to this place whicj is in scarborough. the middle eastern food is awesome, the portions are a good size and the prices are dirt cheap, small swarma dinner for under $ 8 per person, falafels are good and there hot wings are soooooo hot for $ 5o bucks four people will be stuffed as they give you free appetizers, hot peppers, beets, olives and pitas.</li><li>The hummos is to die for, and the ground beef kabobs are great ... the place is nothing to rave about but the food is great.</li><li>THIS place is actually the WORST food establishment I have ever had the displeasure of going to.</li><li>The food is PRICEY, it is absolute CRAP, and it should be illegal for such a place to exist.</li><li>Great Shisha, food ...</li><li>1 star for food.</li><li>Very inexpensive, specially the lunch specials, but the food is just ok.</li><li>They always have great quality tasting food for a great price.</li><li>First, note on the food is that this is a Korean ' Japanese' restaurant.</li><li>Been coming here for years and the food is always yummy, friendly staff, delicious free starters !!</li><li>Well, we all got japanese food.</li><li>So while I was waiting for her to get her food before I would start to eat, the waitress noticed that I was not touching my food.</li><li>10 minutes later, my food was cold.</li><li>No other noteworthy points and most of the food was delicious.</li><li>Service is good and food is fresh and delicious.</li><li>Great food at great prices!</li><li>Mediocre food ( obviously not authentic), limited choice of sushi.</li><li>Food is consistent and good.</li><li>The decor may need an update, but I come for the food.</li><li>I can have slightly higher quality sushi ( not to say Sakura is poor quality) in other restaurants but I 'm likely going to get less food and pay more money.</li><li>Great prices, friendly staff ( they remember us now years later!) and above average food in huge quantities.</li><li>Plenty of free apps with your meal and we always leave with enough food for another meal.</li><li>They have the best prices and food was good with good side dishes ( even as a takeout customer).</li><li>I do n't always shed a tear, but when I do, its over beautiful food.</li><li>You would also know that it 's decent but not great coffee and just decent food that 's only suitable as a filler.</li><li>I have truly lost my appetite and have decided to venture elsewhere to get chinese food.</li><li>I ca n't even begin to think about where it has been and who 's food it has touched.</li><li>The food is really, really good.</li><li>I looked at the food and tasted it it.</li><li>People should spend their hard money elsewhere. nobody speaks a word of English and the food tastes like shit, waste of money do not order. especially delivery.</li><li>Being out of my normal area I do n't see myself making a trip out there to this place just for their food it would be because I 'm with my friends and we are around.</li><li>Great food, awesome service and at a reasonably cheap price where can you go wrong ?</li><li>Their food is good as well.</li><li>This time I will definitely remember it but not for the food it serves as much as for the contingent of its customers.</li><li>This is the restaurant you go to if you want decent food at decent prices, which is perfect for me.</li><li>This is a place that I frequent because it 's close to my house, their food is healthy ( and so are a lot of Korean dishes), and you get decent value from them.</li><li>Good food.</li><li>Large portions, good food, and friendly service!</li><li>Overall quick service, and cheap tasty diner food make the Friendly House one of the best late night options uptown.</li><li>I love the food here.</li><li>The food is always fresh.</li><li>I LOVE their food always HOT and FRESH.</li><li>This place is capable of producing the same variety of drinks and food as Destiny 's tea shoppe, and that 's rather impressive for such a humble space which used to be a cracked out Coffee Time.</li><li>The food is n't too bad, but it 's not something i 'd crave.</li><li>Have not try any cooked food on the menu.</li><li>I 'd say the food is great value at the least!</li><li>This place is just ok overall, although drinks are generally impressive, food is also not bad, but service-wise, it fails!</li><li>I speculate it 's because the food and environment/store is not authentic.</li><li>Decor nice, food so very, very disappointing.</li><li>I have to say that the food has deteriorated a little since it opened, but it 's still good, and my staple place to go with I 'm at my parents place in North York.</li><li>Also, the salad bar is PLENTY of food.</li><li>They also have a regular menu, standard American cafe type of food.</li><li>In spite of the time we woke up, both of us were jonesing breakfast type food.</li><li>The food is average, so we usually order something simple and stuff ourselves at the buffet.</li><li>It 's an upper class restaurant that offers a large amount of food in their salad bar ( Fantastic!).</li><li>The food was pretty good ...</li><li>I 've ordered items off the menu and the food is good, albeit somewhat standard ( you 've probably seen a version of many of the choices in 10 other places).</li><li>I come to this place and I can say it is the worst food place I have been in Toronto.</li><li>They gave me dippems that were a joke, not real food.</li><li>Serves great food ( pasta &amp; oysters).</li><li>The food is not so bad here, but the service is just horrible.</li><li>As I say, it 's only close to work and the food ( when heated) is quite good.</li><li>The food here tastes good, and there are reasonably healthy options available.</li><li>I know what I 'm getting as far as food is concerned.</li><li>Today I was there with some coworkers and noticed that the people who ordered the same thing just before me had their food already.</li><li>I told the person behind the counter that the food sitting their was mine.</li><li>Some of my coworkers chimed in, along with strangers, trying to get them to simply hand me my food.</li><li>The staff would look down at the food, then just stare at us.</li><li>The only reason I 'm giving this place a 3 star is because of the relatively healthy food options they have Their coffee is alright for a change, but I still prefer Starbucks Americano.</li><li>Great food and very quick service as well.</li><li>They have less choice but the food is fairly safe and uninspired for the most part.</li><li>Between the talk of their grandchildren, bragging about who the smart ones were and conversely what trouble makers others were, and their world travels to such places as `` Bah-see-lone-ah'' and how they loved eating Spanish dim sum ( Tapas) the conversation always focused on the food.</li><li>CAFE:- no cafe menu, only one type of coffee ( I never order it, so I do n't know what it is)- there 's no wifi, no need to fight for power outlets ... since there are n't any,:)- the lounge tables are super spacious and comfy, tables are large, great for all sorts of work, from textbooks, tax forms, to picture gallery work- mostly quiet environment, unless we 're talking busy meal times RESTO:- yes, decor 's a little ' unique', think rustic cottage- washroom 's a little cramped- they regularly accommodate for large tables, work with you to come up with a customized menu- large room in the back if you want privacy as well- food is done well.</li><li>I usually come over whenever I need to work on some image post-processing, food refill after tennis or swimming, occasion order pickups if I do n't have time to cook, etc.</li><li>I 've only been here for the special menu and I have to say that the food was fantastic and so unique.</li><li>The food constraints were that there were not to be any shellfish, to minimize foods prepared by deep-frying and low-sodium.</li><li>That being said, the food was generally pretty good, if a bit over-sized.</li><li>Idk why people giving this place higher stars since the food is blend and the service is extremely bad.</li><li>The food is tasteless such a waste of my money.</li><li>Overall, I have nothing against the food.</li><li>The food was horrible.</li><li>She was great but really wished food was better.</li><li>Location: 4916 Yonge Street North York, ON M2N Price: $ $ Service: Friendly The food was not good.</li><li>There are definitely better bar around the area that have better food and drinks.</li><li>I did n't mind the wait at all, but I was really disappointed in the food.</li><li>But overall, food was pretty good not amazing and service was average.</li><li>People could n't place orders or pay their bills, naturally food service is delayed too.</li><li>Friendly service with a smile, fresh coffee ( on my dark roast black), display full of selections of food.</li><li>It looked like last weeks food was reheated.</li><li>The place is very old and grimy, the food is basically tasteless and dry.</li><li>Food was sub-par on nearly all fronts.</li><li>What was supposed to be a hangover breakfast after a night of 151 and coke, and tequila shots, we needed A LOT of water and good hangover food ( which breakfast food usually is).</li><li>This food was dry and tasteless for the most part.</li><li>Food was n't that good, some that you can make yourself I guess.</li><li>Although service was excellent and food seemed very health conscious.</li><li>The food came, and it was a crepe with some cheddar cheese melted on top, a salad and some other garnishings.</li><li>I do n't know what it was about exactly, but I do n't think I want to eat at any restaurant run by a person like that. food was okay, nothing wrong there.</li><li>Excellent food, good friendly service and cozy atmosphere.</li><li>Prices not bad at all for the quality of the food.</li><li>With the prices like these, I was expecting to be in downtown Toronto, eating downtown Toronto quality food.</li><li>Some of the food was very salty.</li><li>However, I did not expect the food to be caught in that time warp as well, as the dishes we ordered definitely tasted like the food we had dining out growing up ( yup, aged myself!).</li><li>However, I did not expect the food to be caught in that time warp as well, as the dishes we ordered definitely tasted like the food we had dining out growing up ( yup, aged myself!).</li><li>The food was amazing even though it is not healthy.</li><li>A bit off-topic, but I think it is silly for Yelpers to review food in a McD 's ( unless they have had food poisoning or bone chips in burgers) or furniture at Ikea.</li><li>It serves Korean fusion food.</li><li>Food and drinks are priced right with some appetizers given.</li><li>Also check out all the other booths selling every kinds of food, fresh produce, and crafts.</li><li>The only underperformer I 've found so far is the roti place, but overall it 's the perfect place to go if you want some tasty but cheap food.</li><li>I love coming here for the food court!</li><li>So in conclusion, I highly recommend visiting this market for the food court, but everything else is really not worth your time.</li><li>We also shared an order of Jerk Chicken with rice and peas and steamed vegetables ( $ 5) at a place called Melo ( food from Trinidad and Tobago).</li><li>The woman working there put the food into a Styrofoam container and then put it in the microwave (!)</li><li>OMG, talk about dangerous chemicals leaching into the food!</li><li>The food itself was good, but I was concerned that I might have been eating carcinogens from the microwaved Styrofoam.</li><li>It 's fun to walk around and browse the wares, but I doubt that I would ever buy anything here other than food.</li><li>Actually, I would definitely return for the food!</li><li>Goes to prove: you do n't have to have a fancy `` ambience'' for the food to be solid.</li><li>The food stalls in the back are awesome!</li><li>Well worth it though as the food is authentic and very tasty.</li><li>Wonderful mom and pop restaurants and the food is always good and cheap.</li><li>If your looking for something fancy go somewhere else but if u want Chinese food and all u can eat then sure go here ... the shrimp is good but the lemon chicken is kinda funky.</li><li>I went for the buffet with my immediate and extended family, and half the food was missing.</li><li>Definite hole-in-the-wall, but it 's $ 10 for the buffet, and the food is pretty reasonable so it 's fine by me.</li><li>The place is definitely very dated and run-down, with very minimal service, but the food is actually quite good and the price is even better.</li><li>But the food was not so great ..</li><li>Overall food was ok for the price so Im giving it one extra star ...</li><li>The best food they had was the Ice-cream- strawberry and chocolate, one of the better ice cream I 've had in a asian buffet place.</li><li>There are places with great food but a less than great appearance.</li><li>All the food was very underwhelming and flavourless.</li><li>I would give the food 5 stars but the place is not ideal for sitting down with small chairs and no washroom, thought its kept very clean ..</li><li>The food is fresh &amp; tasty.</li><li>Just an FYI, you may have some wait time as they seem to make their food on demand, like a restaurant &amp; the guy before me had been waiting 10 minutes.</li><li>High quality food.</li><li>Resembles home cooked food.</li><li>Very yummy food.</li><li>Good food.</li><li>I hope you enjoy the food!</li><li>The food was always fresh and plentiful.</li><li>The restaurant does n't have the fanciest decor but the food is exceptional.</li><li>The food was good, but nothing special.</li><li>The food is essentially the same as Anton 's, but Kosher.</li><li>If you are not Kosher, then I would recommend trying a place like Me-Va-Me or Sofra Grill, where you get more food for the same price.</li><li>Its okay to eat at once in a while ... like Bianca says ... their BBQ chicken is very juicy and yummy, but the food can be a hit and miss!</li><li>The food is quite nice, you get the traditional flavours you 'd expect when you order Chinese.</li><li>The food is ok.</li><li>Food was ok.</li><li>Felt full at the end of the meal and price was reasonable for the amount food you get.</li><li>Service is fast and attentive but the food is not special and very overpriced.</li><li>It 's been my unequivocal experience that more expensive food simply does n't taste better.</li><li>Their food is just ok and their portions are tiny.</li><li>Amazing food!</li><li>I travel there a lot and would highly recommend the food to anyone!</li><li>The food is sub par in terms of the quality I have found hair in my food before there.</li><li>Amazing food, but unfortunately, Marky 's is closing for good July 18th.</li><li>RESTAURANT waiting for the food, they had these vents blowing hot air right at our heads.</li><li>On top of that, it took forever for them to prepare the food.</li><li>This is by no means the type of Greek restaurant where you sit down, order your food and get some quality special greek food.</li><li>This is by no means the type of Greek restaurant where you sit down, order your food and get some quality special greek food.</li><li>You pretty much go up to the front, order your food, wait for your food, collect your food on a tray and go sit down at one of their tables.</li><li>You pretty much go up to the front, order your food, wait for your food, collect your food on a tray and go sit down at one of their tables.</li><li>First off, the food here has never been that stellar to begin with.</li><li>This place is normally the usual weekly takeout as its healthier than most fast food.</li><li>Food was prepared fresh and all ingredients were superior quality.</li><li>The food was fresh &amp; hot.</li><li>The food selection late at night is decent though and they are open 24/7, so I 'll give them that. as other people have said, the drive thru for this location is amazingly quick. trying to park in the parking lot, to go in for a `` bigger'' then normal order is very painful, the layout with the gas station means you have to up your guard when you 're slowly trying to find a parking spot, cause people are whipping in and out without any discretion whatsoever.</li><li>No food available at 2:30am.</li><li>The menu was outrageously expensive for the food that 's offered.</li><li>The first time I went there, my boyfriend and I waited for our food for almost an hour.</li><li>You 're served a lot of food, so I ca n't complain.</li><li>The waitresses are really friendly and the food is decent.</li><li>Good middle eastern style food.</li><li>Good food and a clean open kitchen.</li><li>Great food and reasonable prices.</li><li>Mr combo is located in a place where you really would n't expect to find too much good food but i 've found it to be pretty decent.</li><li>My friend tried a chicken skewer dinner which had a lot of food and two skewers of chicken.</li><li>Food was delicious, chicken skewer was moist and flavorful, sides were good too.</li><li>Who would 've known this place in an old plaza can renew your faith on ' mom n pop 's' culinary talent in showcasing fast, quality food served with plenty of TLC ?</li><li>Food is homey and delicious and reasonably priced with very generous portions.</li><li>Great place for lunch !! hello had this food last weekend. i ordered over the phone and i must say i was very impressed. i ordered for maybe 20 people. the food was very good and very warm when it arrived. they were not cheep at all about any extra sauces or pita we ask for i will for sure be back and think of this spot when i have big events !!</li><li>Excellent food and very clean.</li><li>The staff were super friendly, and the service, though the food prep was a bit slow, was prompt and accommodating.</li><li>I really enjoyed the food and we were given gigantic servings of fish.</li><li>I love this place, if you are looking for good quality food this is the place.</li><li>I 've been coming here for the last 8 years and the food has remained so consistent.</li><li>Brilliant food, service and newly renovated look is much better now.</li><li>The server was nice and our food came with warm pita bread, pickles, onions and peppers, which I enjoyed.</li><li>I 've been to this restaurant a couple times and every time the food has been delicious!</li><li>I 'm gonna keep looking for a new middle eastern spot in this area ... the food was good flavour wise but price wise just didnt do it for me.</li><li>All and all, Alborz exceeded my expectations in regards to cleanliness and ambiance ( really enjoyed the santoor music playing in the background) but the food quality did not match the price.</li><li>He then felt the need to lecture me about the proper way of ordering my food.</li><li>The food is stale here ... enough said do n't come to this location ..</li><li>Food was alright, its Burger king so you should know what you are getting, nothing bad it was decent.</li><li>The place itself looks to be a broken down dingy place where they have cheap food for cheap prices.</li><li>The food did n't look very fresh but I was just so hungry ...</li><li>I 'm sure the food is probably decent earlier in the day around the time it 's opened, but I wo n't make my way back to find out.</li><li>I 've been for both AYCE and a la carts ( with a groupon) The food here is average sushi fare.</li><li>We were super full and could n't even finish all of the food!</li><li>Food is pretty much what you would find at a standard Japanese AYCE.</li><li>For the cooked food.</li><li>Honestly I have been here a few times with my boyfriend and absolutely loved the food- the service on the other hand is horrible- I 'll went with my brother who is handicapped and my father, we were seated and not a single waitress came to even bring us water or ask if we needed help or to place an order ...</li><li>FOOD IS BAD AND OVER PRICED.</li><li>Food was ok but we expected more.</li><li>Hopefully they increase the quantity of the food on the a la carte menu or just stick to an all you can eat restaurant.</li><li>Food are served fresh and hot.</li><li>Food was average, but not bad.</li><li>Overall the cooked food is very good, the rolls lack flavour, and for 8.50- 10 for the specialty rolls, they were very small- all you can eat size.</li><li>Service is great but food is nothing special.</li><li>The price can be a little pricy, but the food was worth it.</li><li>The food came pretty fast, since it was n't too busy when we had our dinner, but they did forget to put in a few of our items and gave us someone else 's order.</li><li>Food is mediocre.</li><li>POINTS: [ waitress mean like hell ] [ food not fresh ] It 's a neighborhood Japanese style restaurant owned not by Japanese.</li><li>I am not even comparing their food to the real Japanese food, but their food is still not good to recommend.</li><li>I am not even comparing their food to the real Japanese food, but their food is still not good to recommend.</li><li>And I tipped a generous tip even though I did not enjoyed the food much.</li><li>Food is also wrong according to my order.</li><li>Food was mediocre.</li><li>I used a groupon for $ 20 worth of food- bought 2 entrees and still paid $ 12.</li><li>The food was good for the fact that I only paid $ 12.</li><li>I believe I paid about $ 24 for $ 60 worth of food here ( not usable with ayce or lunch specials, and must have at least 4 people in order to use.</li><li>The food I liked today includes the short ribs, sakura rose sushi, skillets, chicken kagame, calamari, takoyaki, beef and mushroom wrap.</li><li>The first time I came here was about one month into opening and the food was great.</li><li>The cooked food items were ok, but nothing outstanding.</li><li>Food is subpar.</li><li>I can overlook poor English, poor food and an unreasonable bill, but not this rude, inexcusable behaviour and poor customer service.</li><li>Within 15minutes, the outstanding order arrived and my colleague and I proceeded to enjoy our food.</li><li>There are plenty of flat screens to keep you distracted while you endure the unbearable wait for your food.</li><li>Close to campus, decent food, good place to hang out with friends for a pint after class.</li><li>Took forever to get the food though they did bring all the food for our party of 16 out at once.</li><li>Took forever to get the food though they did bring all the food for our party of 16 out at once.</li><li>But don '' t go here to eat, you 're better off getting food at York Lanes bro.</li><li>I ca n't comment on the food because I did n't order any.</li><li>Food tasted good, servers were friendly and came often enough to check up on our group as well as refill water.</li><li>The food was exactly what I was craving for- greasy ( in a good way), filling and addictive flavouring.</li><li>It 's decent food, meaning nothing was awful or tasted bad.</li><li>Overall the food was good, I am happy to have a simple Chinese restaurant open up close by.</li><li>Got takeout tonight and the food was really good!</li><li>Most impressive of all was the freshness of the food when it arrived!</li><li>I went with my girlfriend to this place and the food was good in general.</li><li>The downside, first was the parking issue, second, we went on a Friday 's night and the place was pact due to their small space so it took them sometimes before giving us a table then also took them a long time to bring our food.</li><li>Honestly for late night food it 's not horrendous, but realistically I wo n't be going here again the food simply was n't good.</li><li>The food is inexpensive and the place is open super late ( unusual to the neighborhood), thus making it ideal for a late night snack before heading back home from the party.</li><li>The food that I got ( ash reshteh, kashke bademjun) was not really delicious in my opinion but my friends liked it!</li><li>Positive: + open very late + very reasonable price for good quality food + good variety in menu Negative:- parking can be an issue in busy hours- their amazing pizza takes toooo long to be ready!</li><li>It used to be a great place with really good food and reasonable prices. they have now increased prices and deceased the size of their portions considerably!</li><li>Still A-ok place to go to at 2 in the morning with no other options i must say, but do n't expect to b blown away by the service or the food.</li><li>Food is very over priced for what it is.</li><li>The food quality was very low and poor quality.</li><li>My absolute favourite food is their Hamburger and mushrooms.</li><li>The food at this place is very good everything on the menu is worth trying and prices are fair as well, how ever the service sucks!</li><li>The waiter/waitress do not check up on you or pay attention to your order I have a friend who is allergic to parsley we had to send her food back three times cause they kept on bringing the food with parsley!</li><li>The waiter/waitress do not check up on you or pay attention to your order I have a friend who is allergic to parsley we had to send her food back three times cause they kept on bringing the food with parsley!</li><li>And the end she give and send the food back. they still wanted to charge us for it !!</li><li>The food was a bit below standards compared to other persian places I have had food at ( Zaffron, Taftan Kebab, and Khorak).</li><li>The food was a bit below standards compared to other persian places I have

environment Nice server Reasonable price Cons: Bad food quality Everything was good but the food!</li><li>We ordered a variety of food and none was fresh.</li><li>Nice place they have very good and tasty food but not healthy at all.</li><li>So if you looking to get some healthy food forget about it.</li><li>I will not go in great details but in summary: the service was poor and rude but the food is good.</li><li>Do not use this review to assess other locations since I have been to over a dozen different locations and food and service have consistently been good!</li><li>Franchise experience should be consistent, the environment, food all has been predetermined, it 's usually the staff that can make it or break it for a location.</li><li>The food may be overpriced here but I enjoy my options and variety.</li><li>Excellent food, service and atmosphere.</li><li>Great food, very chill atmosphere and great drinks ( Asahi Black is an amazing beer you ca n't get at lot of other places).</li><li>We ordered about eighty bucks worth of food, and it was n't worth it.</li><li>I 've always believed that sex and food were a bad mix.</li><li>They serve those giant boat plated platters here, but the environment was too trendy for this kind of food.</li><li>Now onto the food, I do n't know why but it feels like I 've been lied to all my life and the sushi we had at sushi moto is what it should have been all along; the miso soup was great and the beef teriyaki was tender and full of flavour.</li><li>Also, the food was splendid.</li><li>Food was pretty good.</li><li>The food was quite good.</li><li>Great service, atmosphere, and more importantly, delicious food.</li><li>The food was really good but I do n't think I can suck up the prices!</li><li>All that good stuff said, I do n't believe the food is worth it.</li><li>Food was delicious!</li><li>Modern design, clean washrooms, great food, a bar in the middle of the store.</li><li>Service was great, and food was just as good.</li><li>It is technically run by a lot of Koreans I believe but that does n't matter, but food is the great, the staff is friendly and helpful and the pieces they put out look great.</li><li>The food came out immediately after and it was fresh and delicious as always!</li><li>Was first introduced to Sushi Moto a couple of years back and am impressed by the quality of the food, excellent service and beautiful decor.</li><li>3.5 stars ... decent food ... nice servers with short skirts LOL.</li><li>The food selection is varied, unique, and everything tastes great.</li><li>The food has always been good, the presentation on point, and the decor and service has always been good.</li><li>The food is good but nowhere good enough for what they charge.</li><li>Very pricey, small portions, and only adequate food.</li><li>Overall I would give this place a 4 star because I have eaten here many times and love the food, service and atmosphere.</li><li>I will definitely come back! this place is soo expensive. the dinner bento box is almost $ 20. the service is good and the food is great but the prices just arent worth it, at all. there are so many places in this area that are much more reasonable with the same quality food. the ambiance is really nice, which is probably why the prices are so high ... i probably wouldnt visit again. i 'd recommend for people with money to spare lol.</li><li>Considering the environment and the quality of the food.</li><li>All the food here is good- tempura is well fried, chicken tasted like organic ( not sure it is, but it was so good!), and all the fish tasted so fresh and satisfying.</li><li>If we visit Toronto again, we would n't mind coming here gain for the awesome food and service!</li><li>Despite the beautiful presentation, the quality of the food served was not much better than what you get at all-you-can-eat places.</li><li>What 's even worse is that plates of food sit for up to 20 minutes by the sushi bar before a waitress would come pick it up.</li><li>Awesome food.</li><li>I really like the food, I had the best sushi and maki rolls here .the only reason that my review is 4star is, the rest room area and washrooms was `` Very'' dirty.</li><li>Over priced average food.</li><li>Food is Ten-Ichi all you eat quality, very disappointed.</li><li>Now the food.</li><li>With each spontaneous visit, the food is always delicious, the staff are superb ( service and attentiveness) and overall I love the vibe here.</li><li>Great ambience, Great service, Great food.</li><li>We went on a Sunday ( I 've heard sushi should n't be eaten on a sunday) and we did n't do the best job ordering food.</li><li>Food- My in-laws have a tendency of wayyy over-ordering.</li><li>The food is very consistent- consistently great!</li><li>I was seated quickly, had my order taken promptly, and the waitresses kept coming back to make sure the food was alright.</li><li>Friendly atmosphere, cozy, tasty food.</li><li>Delicious food and yummy Mochi desserts!</li><li>Being a `` sushi sob'' in the many key cities of North America, I can honesty said that Sushi Moto was above average for food.</li><li>From there the food quality is impeccable.</li><li>The food was fresh, and there were some neat extras.</li><li>The food has been consistently good, although I have only tried a couple dishes so far.</li><li>The only negative point is that I have noticed the service is quick at first, then nowhere to be found after you 've received your food.</li><li>The food is very fresh and very tasty.</li><li>You 're not here at Sushi Moto because you heard that the sushi there is `` hands down the best you will ever have'', or that the food is so amazing, you had a `` foodgasm'', or [ insert other Yelp/Foodie cliches here ].</li><li>Top notch food and atmosphere !!!</li><li>BTW the food was a 5 too!</li><li>You should expect no less $ 25 if you wanna have good food and drink.</li><li>I went here for a company luch and I can say the food was pretty good and the service was actually very good.</li><li>I expressed my deep gratitude for their service and consistent great tasting food each and every time.</li><li>THANK YOU SUSHI MOTO for your consistent outstanding excellent tasting food &amp; service!</li><li>To sum it all up: Sushi Moto is a large, busy sushi joint ( run by Koreans) serving up pretty good food at reasonable prices in a modern, contemporary setting with pretty good service to boot.</li><li>The menus were fairly substantial, offering everything from cooked food ( yakitori), noodle soups, the standard sushi fare, and even a few Korean dishes ( bulgogi, etc.).</li><li>The food was good and I had a great experience here!</li><li>I am very impressed with the service as well as the food.</li><li>The service was so-so, the food took too long but the decor is nice I guess.</li><li>Their food presentation was great, and quality is not the bottom of the barrel.</li><li>The food was also surprisingly good, and portions are unusually generous: The salmon sashimi lunch actually has enough pieces to not leave you still hungry yet does n't cost an arm and a leg, the bento box was varied and tasted good, and when I tried the kalbi dinner, the plate was stacked with so many large pieces that it puts to shame most other kalbi entrees I 've tried.</li><li>The waitress was quick to serve us and the food came really quickly!</li><li>Food- Fresh, Tasty, and Affordable.</li><li>A little more pricey compared to the other sushi places around, but the presentation of both the food and the atmosphere inside is very classy and upscale.</li><li>Reallly good food and cocktails priced very reasonablly.</li><li>The food is fresh and I 'm glad they have my favourites- uni ( sea urchin), ika ( squid) and hotate ( scallop) in house most of the time.</li><li>I 'm happy to see a mature enough crowd here that knows how to have fun with good food and drinks.</li><li>Price is on par with toronto sushi, and the food is excellent.</li><li>All in all, nothing in particular was done extremely poorly, but if you put it all together, we were disappointed with the quality of the food and none of it felt authentic.</li><li>Wonderful service and excellent food !!!</li><li>Food is satisfactory.</li><li>The food is good, but not remarkable ... you can easily get the same quality of food elsewhere for less.</li><li>Service was great but the food was OKAY, like any other sushi placed I 've tried.</li><li>Like I said, the customer service is two thumbs up but the food is eh ~.</li><li>My problem is I find them to be a little snobby, the sushi sucks ( does not taste fresh seaweed always like rubber) and they are a little over priced on both drinks and food.</li><li>When its my boyfriend and I on our own we choose sushi one across the street every time because the food is better and its cheaper but as I said cool place to go with friends and their cooked food is pretty tasty.</li><li>When its my boyfriend and I on our own we choose sushi one across the street every

and the ambiance/decor is chic!</li><li>Food is amazing ...</li><li>Food was mediocre, kind of looked fancy, but it was not worth the price tag after 30 minutes of waiting for the first dish.</li><li>WONTON SOUP Too salty: ( Service was good but the food was n't that special ( I think I 'll stick with just the uni/ the toro sushi next time hehe).</li><li>Came here for lunch today and really enjoyed the food.</li><li>The food hits the spot when you 're craving some good sushi.</li><li>The food is always fresh and delicious.</li><li>5/5 the food quality is outstanding, fresh, delicious, just great tasting.</li><li>I can tell you the inside is very nice with flat screen tv 's and comfortable booths but the food is n't as great as the reviews here suggest.</li><li>The food comes out nicely on the plate and the taste is just as delicious.</li><li>Rolls are on the smaller side but the quality of the food makes up for it.</li><li>The food is okay but the price is not cheap, and they would n't even let the customer sit for a little longer ?</li><li>The food is really good.</li><li>The food here is likely more expensive than other spots in the neighbourhood.</li><li>4 stars for decor, 3 for food.</li><li>We were both stuffed by the end of the meal, but already thinking about who we were going to bring on our next visit to try more items on their menu ~ Prices are more than the average sushi place, but for service, atmosphere and quality of food I would say you definitely get what you pay for ~.</li><li>Very tasty food and pretty good atmosphere.</li><li>Service is more than on point, tempura is food to go, and sushi great.</li><li>Came here for a first date and the food was really good!</li><li>Would definitely go back again! super clean restaurant, good food, nice staff and the food is very pretty there is parking at the back for those who dont know.</li><li>Would definitely go back again! super clean restaurant, good food, nice staff and the food is very pretty there is parking at the back for those who dont know.</li><li>That aside, for the food, I had the bulgogi dinner and karaage chicken.</li><li>I like the atmosphere with its slick Asian sports bar vibe, the friendly professional and downright good-looking service, and most of all the food.</li><li>Firstly, this place is semi expensive so I expected good food.</li><li>A testament to good food and good service with the right attitude makes for a successful business.</li><li>Let 's get down to the food.</li><li>We took his advice but I found it to be too much food.</li><li>The food is amazing, the place is clean and the staff is always polite.</li><li>The food, decor and service are all top notch.</li><li>You ca n't go wrong at Sushi Moto. excellent sushi and maki, however the time to get the food served was a little bit too long, while the shop was n't very busy yet at the time we visited.</li><li>Not only is the food super tasty, but they have great drinks too!</li><li>The food, service, and ambience is great.</li><li>I come here at least once a month as prices are just a tad steep, but the food is definitely worth it.</li><li>The restaurant has a classy feel about it, the food is excellent ( extensive selection of quality maki) and service is good.</li><li>We got our food quickly.</li><li>Good service, however food was not that good.</li><li>As you pay more for the ambience rather then the food.</li><li>The quality of the food has gone down big time.</li><li>Overall, just a crappy experience. been here only few times and always for lunch. lunch options are very good and at least vegetarian options are pretty cheap ( tofu bento box + soup + salad = $ 7). the food is yummy! and they have some interesting appetizers like avocado tempura! which is just delicious! the staff is friendly and helpful.</li><li>The food is great except for some that I do n't like.</li><li>I 've been to this place a few times and like the food/ decor.</li><li>However, the food was not as good as it used to be from previous visits.</li><li>Came out once chewing food.</li><li>Food: One appetizer, one main ( from Dinner menu selection).</li><li>The food is always super fresh.</li><li>The rest of the food that our party ordered is ok and nothing to write home about.</li><li>But if you make it through all the motions, the food seemed to come out okay, just okay, nothing fabulous by no means.</li><li>Thats the best family restaurant I have ever been in Toronto! + Great service + Louise provides a personalized service, even remembering names, etc + Authentic food + Everything is organic and home made.</li><li>Outstandingly prepared food and warm personalized service.</li><li>The thought the food was average but my husband enjoyed all his dishes.</li><li>Food is unbelievably good and they run a cooking school as well, so you know that they know their stuff.</li><li>As for the food, it was spectacular.</li><li>Nice place with great food The food here is great everything freshly made with love and tender care.</li><li>Nice place with great food The food here is great everything freshly made with love and tender care.</li><li>The place is a really small area but the food makes up for it.</li><li>The environment does n't really stand out too much the food definitely makes up for it.</li><li>This is an odd little house with some great food.</li><li>( I realize this is midtown but when you 're a s.o.b. ( south of bloor) creature it REALLY is quite the trek:) I almost want to give you NO description of the food and the rest of the experience because it 's such a nice quaint discovery ... it would ruin the experience.</li><li>The food was awful.</li><li>Cute spot for dinner with lots of soul going into the food!</li><li>But the food is wonderful.</li><li>The food is great, not spectacular but utterly satisfying.</li><li>A cute little family-run restaurant ( a renovated house) with a super friendly owner and delicious food.</li><li>The food is simple and lovely.</li><li>I love the understated vibe of both the food and the decor.</li><li>Food was alright.</li><li>It was very warm in the dinning room. hot bread was served before real food, very soft inside and crusty outside.</li><li>Both pastas were fantastic, we especially loved the fettuccine, could n't help clearing out all food at once !!</li><li>Very good food, you cannot miss this if you simply want good food in nice environment. cozy little family house style, very friendly owner and server.</li><li>Sh* t i just was going to order and now its permanently closed there was so much love made with there food i will miss them i always ordered when i wanted home cooked excellent food now yonge and sheppard is screwed cause there was nothing comparable now.</li><li>I think the food is delightful but the decor is ... well ... yard-sale.</li><li>I suspect all the food on the menu is good from the moans of pleasure from tables around us, along with the lineup of customers arriving without reservations, but there are gems throughout the menu that will become your favorites.</li><li>Amazing food, extremely quaint and cozy.</li><li>Only complaint is the presentation of the food, but the flavors and and freshness of the food more than outweigh that negative!</li><li>The food was always excellent.</li><li>They even remembered my order, which I definitely enjoyed- the recipes have n't changed but the food is just as delicious.</li><li>I can honestly say that the food quality was over any of my expectations, it was one of the tastiest meals I have ever had.</li><li>The food is okay ...</li><li>Back to the food, the portions are somewhat on the larger side, but mostly filled with rice.</li><li>Great food.</li><li>However the food was A1!</li><li>Prices are very reasonable for the service and quality of the food.</li><li>Top quality food and good generous portion.</li><li>Food was great.</li><li>Great People and Amazing Food.</li><li>The food was nice and hot.</li><li>I highly recommend this place anyone looking for delicious food.</li><li>Other then that the food was good but just nothing to exciting about it.</li><li>Overly priced for mediocre food is all that I can say.</li><li>However ... u know there 's a problem when the food u are consuming makes u believe they are just trying to cheap out on the ingredients.</li><li>Food is good, especially the specials.</li><li>The staff and the food were a perfect symbiosis.</li><li>The food is n't that good.</li><li>All food are in the 6-7 $ range.</li><li>Often pretty crowded too, despite the lack of customer service and food quality.</li><li>I 'm sick and tired of the `` breakfast roulette'' game I play when I order my food.</li><li>Anyone in the mood for great food, a wonderful baked good or an adventure down the aisle to try a little something of an international taste IDF is the place to go.</li><li>This would have made the worse cat food taste great.</li><li>Unfortunately, I was running errands in the area and really needed food.</li><li>The food was n't acceptable and the service was actually kind of unbelievable.</li><li>After some negotiating, manager finally agreed not to charge us for the food we had n't received and had n't eaten.</li><li>He was a riot and made it almost pleasurable to wait for our food ( the place was packed, took about 25 minutes to get our food- not bad, but not great either).</li><li>He was a riot and made it almost pleasurable to wait for our food ( the place was packed, took about 25 minutes to get our food- not bad, but not great

because their food selection is really tasty.</li><li>While the decor and ambience is pleasant, the prices are not indicative of the quality of the food.</li><li>The food was excellent!</li><li>I had a Peroni while we waited for our food, We also ordered the bruschetta, which seemed freshly made and was so refreshing in this weekend 's heat we asked for a second order to go, to take home at the

of pitas, which I really enjoyed!</li><li>Definitely recommendable if you 're in the area and are looking for greek food! good food but the price of my souvlaki was a little on the high side. i asked

much rather go to the Mr. Greek on East Beaver Creek for this type of fare at the same prices with very good food.</li><li>The first 2 times were great- food was delicious, decent portions, and good staff.</li><li>Food was coming out very slowly for everybody, but even people who came after us got their food first.</li><li>Food was coming out very slowly for everybody, but even people who came

got our food and still paid tip to the wait staff because it was n't their fault, but I would never go back after that experience.</li><li>The food is amazing, with big portion sizes.</li><li>Overall, customer service and food is good.</li><li>The reasons why I like here so much are the food taste really delicious ( I tried everything in the menu), the price are cheap for this quality and quantity.</li><li>They make sure the food that provide to customers are freshly made.</li><li>The last part of their menu are Thai food.</li><li>Similar to other Thai food.</li><li>Most of the food are around $ 8- $ 10 and really good amount of food.</li><li>Most of the food are around $ 8- $ 10 and really good amount of food.</li><li>For a location in this area, their food is n't cheap.</li><li>However the actual food there is n't so good, and fresh.</li><li>Dont get me wrong the food tastes great, but dont be surprised if you get diarrhea.</li><li>Cheap food and big portions, but unhealthy and greasy.</li><li>Overall the food 's been good, but I stopped going because the wings were inconsistent.</li><li>I actually enjoyed the food I ordered there was really good tasting ..</li><li>Overall, I typically leave feeling satisfied with its food and customer service.</li><li>The manager is sexist however the waitress Sara was very polite and kept apologizing as if it was her fault the food we got was cold ..</li><li>Food is n't that bad but if you have to eat, grab something from the sandwiches/burger menu as they 're all reasonably priced.</li><li>The food sucked!</li><li>The appetizers are a little higher priced for the food, and we split the Thai Chicken Bites.</li><li>Overall, the patio was nice, the food fair, and the kids menu a home run.</li><li>Good service but TERRIBLE food.</li><li>I have eaten here three times now and each time the food got worse and worse.</li><li>You will get better food at the McDonalds across the way.</li><li>Food surprisingly fresh this time.</li><li>Friendly staff, clean, maintained washrooms, hot food, fresh salads.</li><li>All the items were served hot, food was fresh ( especially important for salad ingredients) and service and timeliness of dishes was perfect.</li><li>Prices are a little high for the food.</li><li>The food itself is quite good, probably 3.5 stars.</li><li>Overall the food has a light touch, which can be good or bad depending on your mood.</li><li>I do sometimes get hungry an hour or two after eating their food, which probably means they use less oil and grease than other places- a good thing, to be sure!</li><li>Their service was prompt, food was fresh- including the noodles, which is pretty hard to come by these days when you compare the price units on OrientK 's menu in the delivery side of the restaurant business in its neighbourhood.</li><li>However, the service was quick and friendly and the food was good.</li><li>I think the food has gone downhill, our fav 's were hot turkey sandwichs and roast beef dip.</li><li>During those occasions- I think the food is competent at a competitive price point.</li><li>If one can get over its retirement home ambiance ( which I managed to- if food is the main item of consideration) I think Windfield 's punches above its weight.</li><li>Great service and food.</li><li>But you 'll come back because the food is simple and good and the staff are friendly.</li><li>At the end of the day, despite the food being good, it 's not WOW, but rather, you come here for that warm service.</li><li>The food is genuine, well prepared and tasty.</li><li>They will have a good time and will like the food.</li><li>The food is not five star dining, but it is good and satisfying.</li><li>Summary: Good honest food.</li><li>I guess it 's a testament to the value and consistency of the food.</li><li>I ca n't understand the reviews below, sure it 's outdated but the food is fantastic.</li><li>Very good comfort food at good prices.</li><li>Food was great, service was great, and prices were very reasonable.</li><li>Decent food and decent prices.</li><li>All the food our group ordered was very good, and large portions.</li><li>The portion size of any meal here is out of this world big and the only problem with that is the food being so good you just want to finish everything on your plate.</li><li>I like how I have a bunch of small dishes to munch on while waiting for the food.</li><li>The service was good, the waitress was really nice to us and she made sure we were enjoying our food.</li><li>We did n't have to wait long for our food which was great since I was STARVING!</li><li>The food is good- this is probably one of the better Korean restaurant locations I 've tried in North York ( outside of the Koreatown strip on Yonge between Finch and Sheppard).</li><li>The waitresses were attentive and the food came from the kitchen fast enough.</li><li>Because it has basically failed in the most basic thing which is the food.</li><li>The food was below average at best.</li><li>It has bad food.</li><li>However I find the food to be just average.</li><li>Good food ... regular spicy level for Korean.</li><li>It is hard to find and pretty dark inside but the service is great and the food is spectacular.</li><li>Service is great and food even better!</li><li>The food:- Banchan: the are very generous with the appetizers here, the little spicy cucumbers and japchae are my favorite 4/5- Beef bone soup: dumplings/ rice cake/ egg white drop in a milky beef bone broth soup 4/5- Dolsot bibimbap: so many toppings!</li><li>Overall, love the ambience, great service and wonderful tasting food.</li><li>The food came out unexpectedly fast.</li><li>`` Delicate and light'' is how I would describe their food.</li><li>Before I comment on the delicious food at Koryo, I just want to say I love their staff!</li><li>Like the interior, the food as well is clean and crisp.</li><li>The food is delicious.</li><li>Cutest little Korean restaurant with great food!</li><li>With both rice and japchae in the hot stone pot, the food stayed nice and hot while offering a good amount of food to fill you up.</li><li>With both rice and japchae in the hot stone pot, the food stayed nice and hot while offering a good amount of food to fill you

good although I once again admit my limited experience with traditional Korean fare.</li><li>The food is METICULOUSLY prepared at this restaurant.</li><li>The food was good and our waitress was pleasant.</li><li>The food is delicious and it 's so conveniently located too:) Whenever we ask for seconds on the appetizers they 're happy to provide:) great customer service.</li><li>You can tell they put a lot of care into the food and presentation.</li><li>It was n't long after the food came and ONCE AGAIN NO STICKY RICE in my ginseng chicken soup ..</li><li>It was tasty however food portion a bit small.</li><li>Great service, friendly staff and good food.</li><li>In terms of food, I ordered the seafood soon tofu and it was okay.</li><li>We were very satisfied with the food and the service.</li><li>Overall I found everything quite pleasant- service was fast, polite and friendly, the restaurant is not huge ( 12 tables ?) but clean, the food came at good temperature and quite tasty.</li><li>Their prices has increased over the years, and the quality and portion of the food has gone down.</li><li>Really enjoyed the food here.</li><li>Overall, this is a great experience if you want some quality korean food!</li><li>Overall was a poor food experience.</li><li>Also, I did n't appreciate that a group of 2 came 10 minutes after me ( I was in a pair as well), ordered 20 minutes after me, and received their food 10 minutes before me.</li><li>The waitress, who probably did n't understand my request, replied, `` the apps come with the food.''</li><li>Greatest food.</li><li>Both were very tasty, but man the food is here is just so greasy and unhealthy, I do n't think I will go back often.</li><li>Regardless, most of the food tried was awesome and incredibly flavourful and is making my mouth water as i write this.</li><li>The best place in the city and maybe even North America for Chinese food ( American/Canadian style, I do n't think they do real Chinese food).</li><li>The food comes out super quick and is very fresh.</li><li>So far, the review sounds like a 4 star, but my complaint of the place is that too much of the food is too Americanised ( I guess Canadianized since I am in Canada) and fried.</li><li>Everything was tasty but overall the food is too salty and greasy.</li><li>So with that I only had one last thing that could make me like this place: the food.</li><li>Not unless you do n't mind how your waiter treats you and only come for fast service and good food.</li><li>I suspect all the food is pre-made in the back as it literally comes out moments after you order it.</li><li>Szechuan Gourmet makes me feel conflicted; the food is amazing and I know I 'll want to go again but it 's really far from downtown and inaccessible by public transportation.</li><li>Restaurants are either too authentic that the food is unpalatable or too westernized for the Gui lau crowd.</li><li>Why ca n't someone open a restaurant and hire a chef who prepares quality proteins with great wok hay and uses an abundance of garlic, chill and ginger where the food is n't doused in grease.</li><li>Delicious food and fast service it never disappoints.</li><li>The quality and taste of the food is always consistent, fabulous chefs here.</li><li>The food is always fresh tasting and arrives quite quickly to the table.</li><li>Szechuan is my favorite, their food is so good it is like being a little kid having some candy.</li><li>They are VERY fast, I have never seen food cooked so fast in my life.</li><li>Shredded pork in garlic sauce had a spice that I could n't place but did n't like ... a lot of dishes seemed to have traces of this spice and it made all the food taste the same.</li><li>The food is plain garbage.</li><li>Food was expensive, but I didnt mind that because I expected quality for the money more so than quantity.</li><li>The food is always delicious.</li><li>I called the restaurant to tell them that the food was cold, and was promptly put on hold for five minutes.</li><li>After being reconnected, I was informed that it was impossible that the food was cold, as they checked with the kitchen and that it had been made to order.</li><li>So we then packed up the food in order to return it to the restaurant.</li><li>My wife took the food in and was then told that the cook said the food was hot and that it had been an hour since we ordered and since the customer is not always right we will not get our money back.</li><li>My wife took the food in and was then told that the cook said the food was hot and that it had been an hour since we ordered and since the customer is not always right we will not get our money back.</li><li>Great food.</li><li>Either way it was the closest to my building so gave the order and took the food.</li><li>I do n't even want to describe the other food we ate because the thought of it makes me want to vomit!</li><li>Mind you there was a 6 hour gap between from when i ordered the food and ate it.</li><li>Now let 's talk food ...</li><li>The food was DRENCHED in oil and a host of other things.</li><li>The food was undistinguishable from what it was supposed to be and everything was over cooked.</li><li>The food is always delicious and THEY BRING IT OUT SO FAST.</li><li>Great food.</li><li>The food was really yummy and made spicy for us just the way we like it.</li><li>I think the food could have done with some more heat in fact.</li><li>Stumbled upon this place searching for something `` szechuan'' to satisfy my craving, though this was n't a place that served boiled fish in chili soup or anything, it certainly exceeded my expectations! 4 star simply because the food is a bit salty for my palate ( will ask for less next time).</li><li>Lastly, the food!</li><li>The food was very simple- very oily too.</li><li>But the food is absolutely wonderful. we are regular customer, s at this restaurant, Tonight we ordered the usual, our favourte dish is peanut chicken, we brought our three dish, s home and upon opening the chicken we saw half the dish was peanut sauce and less than half the usual amount of chicken, I called the restaurant and spoke to the owner for ten minutes, she insisted that it was made the same as always, It was not at all, we paid 11,95 for peanut sauce and a small amount of chicken,, The arrogant owner could not care less, refusing to credit us for next time we picked up, or d delivering a new dish to our home, This place the staff is unfriendly, not well mannered, and horrible customer service, and the food was awful, except for the fried rice, it was good, If your looking for bad service this is the place to go, the customer is never right,, be warned,.</li><li>But the food is absolutely wonderful. we are

average food gobbling broad.</li><li>Restaurant: Jung Soo Nae Cuisine: Korean Location: North York Address: 5754 Yonge St Price Range: ~ $ 10 1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent Food: 3.5 Service: 3 Ambiance: 2 Overall: 3.5 Extra information:* 2 locations owned by 2 different owner* Lunch menu avail* Seasonal menu avail Jung Soo Nae is what you call a ' hole in the wall' restaurant.</li><li>This restaurant is family run and serves authentic Korean food, their food is anything but fusion.</li><li>Price for dinner is pretty decent for the amount and quality of the food that you are getting.</li><li>The food was good but compared to the surplus of amazing Korean restaurants in the area it 's tough to give it more than 3 stars.</li><li>Anyway, our side dishes came fairly quickly as well as our food.</li><li>I have travelled to Korea since 1999 and this place reminds me of the food I loved in Jeolla Province in S. Korea.</li><li>The quality of the food is excellent and prepared meticulously and with care.</li><li>The food is good in general.</li><li>The food here was very good and we did not experience any bad service like some other reviews.</li><li>It 's unassuming, no frills, old-fashioned, AWESOME country food.</li><li>I know it 's weird but I felt like I actually was invited to a Korean friend 's house to try their food.</li><li>I 've been to this place twice and it was quite full so we assumed the food must be good.</li><li>The food was just like every other Tim 's.</li><li>It 's made in behind where you ca n't see what 's being done to your food.</li><li>Friendly service and great food.</li><li>Delivery service is also prompt and food comes fresh.</li><li>Bound by ancient laws and traditions, simple prohibitions against eating pork or seafood, or boiling a kid in it 's mothers ' milk have given rise to a series of increasingly restrictive rules which speak not only to the food that ends up on one 's plate, but the plate itself, the kitchen that prepares the food, and the whole supply chain from farm to table.</li><li>Done poorly, it turns food into bureaucracy, drained of colour and taste as business owners sacrifice quality in order to pay the freight for the gatekeepers of the kashruth process.</li><li>There are some very good kosher restaurants in the city, but for the most part you pay a significant premium to eat healthy, tasty food.</li><li>The food is consistently satisfying.</li><li>It 's refreshing to go there for the food and experience.</li><li>They also somehow allow them to bud in line. just had food from here this morning, last night, earlier in the day yesterday, just after a first breakfast yesterday morning and im hoping to polish off the remnants over the next couple of days. hows that for committed ? like all great middle eastern places, i only have them when i am north of eglinton. this is not a frequent occurrence, for good reason. however, when im there, i delight in their robust falafel balls that crunch on the outside and warm your mouth with the softness of a pillow on the inside. this holds true even when they are cold- except for the crunchy part, but NEVER are they dry like virtually all falafel places south of there. the salads are fresh, tasty, albeit a little oily- but i cant resist the eggplant salad even though its bathing in oil. the pita is the only kind i enjoy- a big circular pocket thats fluffy and fresh. the hummous and tehina are perfect in their consistency, and spice. the only thing that i dont like from this place, is when you go inside and order a falafel sandwich ... its gargantuan ... so much so that you have no idea how to approach it ... and you want to approach it ... its like a hot sexy big assed, big breasted, big lipped woman. ( not quite sure if that metaphor worked but, i gave it a go at least.).</li><li>The service is unreliable and disorganized and the food is barely acceptable.</li><li>The food has always been above average, but oily.</li><li>Finally after you wait in 2 lines your food starts to get made.</li><li>Then, when I politely asked one lady behind the counter about my order status, she rudely answered that the food will be ready when it 's ready and that I should n't meddle in things that I do n't know about.</li><li>So now I attempt to spare myself from utter humiliation by just ordering my food in person.</li><li>Good food and service though the line is ridiculous.</li><li>Good food, elegantly served by friendly staff.</li><li>Food is fresh and you can tell the care that goes into each dish.</li><li>Our food was okay this time, nothing to cheer about.</li><li>The food was still good, and the end of the day always happy with coras but sometimes its just some of the small things, that need to be mastered ....</li><li>The food was amazing, but the service was not so great.</li><li>The server did n't take my order so I had to ask him to come back and then when the food came out we were missing a place and it took a while for the last plate to come out ( which I assume our server missed the order) But overall the food was yummy!</li><li>The server did n't take my order so I had

's locations serve great food, so find another location because this one will just make your blood boil.</li><li>The food is good, but all Cora 's locations serve great food, so find another location because this one will just make your blood boil.</li><li>That said, the food is always good, the portions are ginormous, and once you actually get seated the waitstaff is helpful and sweet.</li><li>It 's convenient and the food is good, which is why we keep coming back, but the long lines and dreadful seating management take it down a star and crush your soul.</li><li>- I love Cora 's and this was a good location- great service, yummy food.</li><li>Good food and good service.</li><li>The servers are super friendly and the food came fast.</li><li>The food itself was okay, but nothing to write home about.</li><li>No water was provided or offered so after ordering the Food, I went to the Drink Fridge next to the small-scale Dry Goods Shop to pick up a Sidral Mundet ( Apple Soda $ 2.00).</li><li>The food is GREAT but the service is EXTREMELY slow.</li><li>I suggest calling to order food at least half an hour prior to coming in to ensure you do n't die of hunger while waiting for the food.</li><li>We 've dined here a few times but it 's the same issue of waiting so long for the food.</li><li>The last time we visited, we waited for almost an hour for our food and we were n't given much attention to by the servers.</li><li>I would go here everyday for their delicious food but I 'm always deterred by the slow service.</li><li>Take way too long to bring your food, pupusas are n't even that great and the curtido sauce even worse.</li><li>That must mean great food!</li><li>Great food!</li><li>The food was quite a lot for the price ( I paid $ 20).</li><li>The food is pretty standard ... nothing to jump for joy about.</li><li>I come here only when its been so long that I have forgotten what the food tastes like.</li><li>Food is good.</li><li>Now to the food.</li><li>Other than that the food is pretty good so if I 'm ever free on a weekday I may consider coming here.</li><li>BUT the food.</li><li>Overall wonderful food, portion size, and service for the price.</li><li>Coming to the food ..</li><li>The food came in fairly large portions, especially the banana crepe ( we added strawberries to it, too).</li><li>Overall, the food was good.</li><li>This location 's service is a bit slow but the food is always great.</li><li>This location is great, service and food were spot on!</li><li>Paying over $ 30 for 2 veggie omelettes not including coffee seems a little too much for their quality of food and service.</li><li>When someone is leaving half their food on the plate, they should be asking what was wrong with it.</li><li>The wait time to get a table was probably around 10 minutes and the wait time for our food was about 10 minutes as well.</li><li>The food was DELICIOUS!</li><li>Food was just okay, they forgot the toast.</li><li>Normally, I expect and have always been provide with clean food here, not greasy, and very fresh.</li><li>OK food when they give you meat that is not dry and hard.</li><li>I gotta give this place 4 1/2 stars because they did n't have fries to go w/ the shawarma, but because the food was so good and all of their meat is Halal, I 'll round up to 5 stars.</li><li>It 's probably not unreasonable to be concerned about the health of the food items as it was sharing warm air with the restaurant, I was the first and the only customer when I walked in at around 5pm ( Wednesday), but about a dozen savvy customers came through within the next 15 minutes I spent munching in the patio.</li><li>There was ' magic' in his touch and mix of the food items delivered to my senses.</li><li>The food is good and the price is great.</li><li>This one is a bit of a dive on the inside but the food seems to be consistently better.</li><li>The other one, a little north of here, has a fast-food squeaky-clean atmosphere but the food id not as good. for under $ 10 you walk away feeling like you ate well in every respect.</li><li>The service and quality of food is extremely disappointing as chicken was their only option since they burned their beef.</li><li>The pain in my stomach feels like needles jabbing my stomach from the inside and the outside and it is extremely upsetting because no restaurant should be serving food thats been contaminated or has gone bad.</li><li>Good delicious food.</li><li>I am a huge fan of Shwarma, however I find their food to be a very low quality meats and not terribly tasty- it is definitely my least favorite Schwarma place that I have tried in all of the GTA.</li><li>TERRIBLE food and service.</li><li>To top if off when I got back into my car with the food, I realized he did n't even toast the shawarma and the whole thing was cold including the meat ( luke warm).</li><li>It was the most disgusting service and food I ever had.</li><li>Tasty food with quick service in a clean restaurant with friendly services.</li><li>I 've been here twice and now I crave the food, especially the hot sauce which has some heat but does n't overwhelm.</li><li>Not gourmet, sit down food but a whole lot better taste and health than the McD 's or Tim 's across the street.</li><li>The inside interior of the restaurant is so fresh and sexy, but the food is mediocre at best.</li><li>The food is the typical Westernized version of Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese and Japanese dishes.</li><li>The food is tasty enough, but with all the other mom and pop shops around this area touting authentic versions of the various cuisines, why not give those a try ?</li><li>In terms of content, it consisted of variety of food, which is awesome.</li><li>The selection of food is great, as there is nice variety of different Asian meals like Sushi, Chinese, and Korean.</li><li>I really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere of the place.</li><li>The food has a great taste, well seasoned, cooked just right, and brought out in an expedient manner.</li><li>( In China, Pizza is served on fine china, in an upscale establishment, and enjoyed using a knife &amp; fork) The food is alright, just the spring rolls .. they are deplorable.</li><li>We went at 9 45 and they said as or last call is at 10 we wo n't take ur order as you might not enjoy the food.</li><li>When I ordered normal food they were out of veggies and I ended up getting a whole lot of broccoli and chicken.</li><li>Thai green curry was like re heated food.</li><li>Bad service bad food.</li><li>I came here for dinner and the food was really good.</li><li>Service is terrible, food quality is awful.</li><li>Good food, poor service.</li><li>The food is good and sushi are fresh.</li><li>The food is decent for the price, the staff is very friendly with excellent customer service love there Pad Thai &amp; rolls.</li><li>The food quality and flavour is n't something a chef can really dictate over, its up to headquarters and; 2.</li><li>When we got the food home, the ha gow was smaller than normal.</li><li>The food is good and its value for money just under $ 20 you could eat to your hearts content from the assortment of sushi to a variety of Thai Chinese Japanese and Korean meals.</li><li>I would recommend this place sans the wait time it offers the value for money and sn array of fresh delicious food.</li><li>Food was OK nothing special.</li><li>The food was delivered promptly, was fresh &amp; delicious.</li><li>When six people go for lunch and all agree that the quality of the food has gone down hill to the point you would not go back if it were free, you know its bad. food okay but inconsistent in quality. sauces taste store bought. veggie spring rolls very bland.</li><li>When six people go for lunch and all agree that the quality of the food has gone down hill to the point you would not go back if it were free, you know its bad. food okay but inconsistent in quality. sauces taste store bought. veggie spring rolls very bland.</li><li>When they had 1 or 2 restaurants the food quality was much better and the service was great, it has gone downhill.</li><li>All in all, decent Canadian-ized Thai fusion food, nice décor, slooooooooow service.</li><li>Sloppily prepared and very oily food.</li><li>I too have been to another location ( Yonge and Eglington where Hooters used to be) and the food was much better.</li><li>Worse off, when the food does arrive, it is sub-par.</li><li>The only bad thing about this place is that the food comes slow, which can make you full pretty fast because you have to wait a while for all the food to arrive.</li><li>The food is fresh and it comes quick.</li><li>The food is horribly overpriced for very low quality.</li><li>Good service but poor food.</li><li>I looooooove thai food ... not in spring rolls though ... it 's ok to come here for food on a lunch break maybe or while waiting for the movie at the cinema ... but not the ultimate food destination. what makes me put 2 starts is not even quality or authenticity of food but the smell of fried cheap oil that surrounds this restaurant whenever you pass it on the street ... there is also a hint of that smell inside in some parts of the restaurant ... other spring rolls locations would probably get a higher rating from me.</li><li>I looooooove thai food ... not in spring rolls though ... it 's ok to come here for food on a lunch break maybe or while waiting for the movie at the cinema ... but not the ultimate

for thai food was way better.</li><li>I dont know if it 's just this location but the food was horrible !!!</li><li>There was nothing wrong with our food.</li><li>When he came to speak to us, he refused to apologize, said it was our responsibility to ask to be moved and since there was nothing wrong with our food, he could only give us a 10% discount.</li><li>I can understand why some people on here give this place low ratings for food that is n't entirely `` authentic'' and it IS somewhat pricey, but I 've always had excellent service here, and I 've been at least 5 or 6 times.</li><li>Love the decor but can`t say the same for the food.</li><li>Not a destination place for the food.</li><li>Ok, the food is not exactly disgusting--but it is not particularly tasty.</li><li>I 've always thought Spring Rolls was decent food, but over priced from what you 're getting.</li><li>And I should say that it 's true the people working there are always friendly and the falafal I always get is always great tasting and it 's only $ 4.50 or something like that. it 's food worth your money. and a great runaway place for lunch breaks.</li><li>Food was delicious, wish they gave more chicken.</li><li>The food there was really good.</li><li>Yummy food and great service.</li><li>The food quality is just `` meh''.</li><li>The food here is awesome.</li><li>A place for a brunch! 3 tables around us had issues with their food and so did we.</li><li>The food came out really fast ( under 5 minutes) but was just ok, my eggs were a little over cooked from what I asked, and my toast was barely buttered at all.</li><li>I think the food here is decent, nothing special.</li><li>I am very picky with the smell of egg in food and egg smart did a good job to satisfy me.</li><li>The food came very quickly which was awesome because we were famished.</li><li>The food was cooked to specifications and was good, as expected from a breakfast chain.</li><li>Becoming weary and famished, I tried flagging one of the very few waiters working that Saturday early/mid afternoon ( which is not an unpopular time for the type of food they are serving).</li><li>I love egg benedicts so I ordered a vegetarian option that was not on the menu ( the menu in general is not super veg friendly) for some reason they give you an option of having the eggs hard, medium or soft which I never experienced before in any of the brunch places. bennies just always come soft- otherwise they 're not bennies but hard boiled eggs on top of an english muffin, the portion included only side of fries and two bennies with spinach. no slices of orange, no toast included. total of $ 9 the spinach somehow had very grassy taste. hollandaise sauce was too salty and flavorless ... the whole food tasting experience was just blah. on the other end the service was very nice and even though they confused my friend 's order the replacement came in in matter of seconds and she was charged less. but I 'm not going back for eggs ... maybe will check pancakes or waffles.</li><li>It took us 2 min to order and 10 min to get the food in a full packed Saturday morning.</li><li>Seriously, I didnt even check the review before i went there as i thought it ca n't be bad. i 've been to lots Caribbean restaurants in gta and i usually like the food.</li><li>The food is amazing and always fresh and well prepared.</li><li>Prices are a tad bit high for this type of food, but you get what you pay for.</li><li>Food is good .. do n't question the receipt, ever lol.</li><li>It has always been consistent in the quality of food served.</li><li>I have been going here since the first day they opened and I can honestly say there are so many things about this place that annoy the hell out of me but their great food keeps me coming back.</li><li>The food is made fresh.</li><li>It seems the food they cook in the morning is served till the evening.</li><li>The food is barely warm which leads me to believe it is n't safe to eat.</li><li>The food, I 've had much better.</li><li>I have had a couple of unprovoked drivethru assaults where the employees have given me stale food or messed up my order.</li><li>This is also a 24 hour McDonald 's drive-thru, right off the highway which is great for those nights you really need greasy food at 3AM.</li><li>I have visited numerous locations and this location is definitely one of the best, I get fresh, hot, quality food more often at this location than any other, with the possible exception of the Pape store.</li><li>Some franchised locations and I am not saying ALL can be very stingy on everything from sauce to napkins and even making fresh food.</li><li>The food was fine.</li><li>The food is the same as everywhere else.</li><li>This is comfort food that has the right amount of grease ( which did not seem old) and not too salty.</li><li>None of the food seemed greasy either.</li><li>ORIGINAL: The food quality is good, but the Asian lady at the cash register is SHADY.</li><li>Other than that crazy woman 's shameful habit of stealing, the food usually tastes great.</li><li>The food is made fresh each time you order so it is not just sitting in a heated container or buffet for hours.</li><li>You ca n't beat freshly made food!</li><li>Flies flying around. &amp; here i am still waiting for my food ..</li><li>Ok so the food has come and it is quite tasty and good portion.</li><li>The stars are just for the food.</li><li>I 'd say the service is great, the price is VERY reasonable ( for the amount of food they give you- the containers barely shut!) and the food is delicious!</li><li>I 'd say the service is great, the price is VERY reasonable ( for the amount of food they give you- the containers barely shut!) and the food is delicious!</li><li>After waiting for 1 hour 15 minutes, we called to see where our food was; they assured us that their delivery person had left and would arrive shortly.</li><li>After 15 more minutes, we called again, and were told that our food had n't even been cooked yet; no explanation was given as to why we 'd been told it was nearly here.</li><li>We wo n't be ordering from China Gourmet again. dropped by for a $ 30 worth of food, left not much more than five minutes later, hot, FAST!</li><li>Typical Chinese-Canadianized food does not disappoint, yum.</li><li>It was n't very speedy, and it definitely was n't very fancy, but the food was good and in the end that 's all I care about.</li><li>Great food, I like it a lot.</li><li>Waited nearly 2 hours for my food for delivery.</li><li>The food is ok ( 6/10) if you dine in.</li><li>Twenty minutes later, our food had still not arrived and we called to cancel as it had been over an hour and if the driver had left when we called 20 min ago, our food was likely no longer hot.</li><li>Twenty minutes later, our food had still not arrived and we called to cancel as it had been over an hour and if the driver had

Gourmet, not having had their food before.</li><li>I knew right away that the food was going to be bad, because I could n't feel the usual warmth of freshly cooked Chinese takeaway through the bag.</li><li>The food was cold.</li><li>I 've been here twice before and I 've always enjoyed their food.</li><li>Overall, the food quality was great.</li><li>Everyone enjoyed their food- it tasted fresh and the presentation was on par with most good Sushi places I 've been too.</li><li>The service is quick and the food tastes really good.</li><li>But the price is kind of fair. ok food but bad service. the waiter never talk to u or answer u when u talk to him. the food is average and i 'd rather visit otjer places to eat pho.</li><li>But the price is kind of fair. ok food but bad service. the waiter never talk to u or answer u when u talk to him. the food is average and i 'd rather visit otjer places to eat pho.</li><li>Vietnamese Delight is clean with friendly service and the food is good standard Vietnamese food, I would stop in again when in the neighbourhood.</li><li>The decor is much nicer than Wonderpho and if the food is quite similar why not go to the better looking restaurant.</li><li>The food is fairly decent as there were a lot of options to choose from, ranging from Pho to Vermicelli to Hainan Chicken on Rice.</li><li>Food is good, service is fast and friendly.</li><li>The food is good and consistent and does the job when you 're in the mood for viet.</li><li>Viet Delight is actually operated by Chinese people and the food served there are Viet and Malaysian.</li><li>They made me choke a bit on the saltiness of the spice and needless to say, I did n't finish my food because of that.</li><li>Horrible service but decent food.</li><li>If u want good food get the spring rolls they r bonerific ...</li><li>Personally I find La Prep to be somewhat overpriced but, eh, we live in a fast casual food world and this one is located in York University where the food seems to always be slightly more expensive or the portions slightly smaller than the same chain elsewhere.</li><li>Hot Spicy Spicy caters to people who demand the same level of numbing hotness in their food which regularly cooked with flavor.</li><li>I was looking for the blackboard where the food should have been listed, but low &amp; behold ...</li><li>The service is quick, as I expect from any Northern Restaurant which already have some of the food prepared beforehand, often prior to knowing of our coming.</li><li>I very impressed by the Northern Restaurant, food in a enclosed area, lights, tables and chairs ... even a door!</li><li>Anytime I have a freind from out of town who wants good Toronto food ....</li><li>The food is really good and as spicy as it should be in Sichuan.</li><li>Although the food tasted good, the price is a little bit higher than average, considering the restaurant 's service and environment.</li><li>Like this place was was abit dirty, but the food was amazing.</li><li>Neither of these are a part of my regularly food staple therefore I give them an A-OK for now but for more details please refer to the next review.</li><li>Hope it went to a better place, while I was tasting the heat from the spicy food.</li><li>I am wavering between a three or a four star because although the food is very good, the experience was n't the best.</li><li>The chinese name of the restaurant is called `` ma la tang'' which literally translate to `` numb spicy boil'' and usually what it means is to have food cooked in a broth that 's really hot and spicy.</li><li>But rather than picking your own food to be cooked, they have a dish called exactly that but without any explanations of what is in the dish.</li><li>I found they make the food too salty.</li><li>Since I love numbing sensation and spicy food, I 'll give them the benefit of the doubt for this time.</li><li>Overall, I had a pleasant meal and the food is good.</li><li>Food was so so.</li><li>Short Version: This place is pretty authentic Chongqing food.</li><li>Sichuan is a big province and food have small difference from city to city in Sichuan.</li><li>The food is pretty good for a spicy restaurant.</li><li>The food here is excellent, but above-average price, and therefore, I think they ought to step up their service/decor game.</li><li>Food was superb.</li><li>I went with my asian friend who spoke mandarin and the food was ultra spicy and tongue numbing.</li><li>If you 're expecting detailed breakdown of what 's in the food, forget it.</li><li>They keep the cost down by focusing on fresh food rather than decor and models in mini-skirts ( yes I 'm talking about Joey '' s restaurants).</li><li>Too much food Spicy and sour vermicelli: i order it whenever i see it on the menu at any chinese restaurant.</li><li>I would n't say they have the best food, but they are very generous in the portion size and condiments.</li><li>I should mention that even for people who love, no, need spicy food regularly, the Chunking dry-fried chicken is pretty, pretty spicy.</li><li>The food is great but the owner has the worst attitude for someone in the service industry.</li><li>Just do n't expect much in the way of food.</li><li>As long as you do n't mind the noise, I would come back for the study space as long as they fix their wifi, and possibly try their food options ( although based of previous reviews, are not that appetizing).</li><li>The decor is cute and dainty, food is not up to par though.</li><li>However the truth is it is basically a regular waffle, with oreo pieces and chocolate ice cream. literally the opposite. the star they lost was due to extremely long wait time for the deserts, and also the waffles false advertisement. overall service and environment is nice, and the food was decent, so its worth a try, but probably not on a day right before a weekend perhaps.</li><li>Although the food was not great, I liked the environment and wanted to have a future gathering with my friends there.</li><li>Then we noticed that there ` a $ 3 surcharge if you share your food and do n't get your own items.</li><li>With a very friendly staff with a nice smile located on the 2nd floor a little hidden but once you go in, you hear the sounds of Korean songs playing but not upbeat but more relaxing kind ? ( I do n't make sense) The food is delicious though it is kinda pricey for me.</li><li>It 's still a cute place to hang out w/ friends though. service, food, everything was great--especially the atmosphere. super cosy and easily my ( and many of my friends ') favourite cafe in the area try out the cinnamon honey brick bread and their bingsoo! this is the only cafe so far in toronto that serves shaved milk ( instead of regular water which makes it extra creamy and delicious). their servings are always very large so going with a friend is recommended but not necessary. if you 're looking for drinks, their sweet potato latte is the best I 've had in toronto and as for cold drinks, all of their bubble teas are very nice would definitely recommend to try out for anyone in the area.</li><li>I was quite surprised they ran out of food on a Friday evening.</li><li>Menu items are standard in terms of price, but the food items can be a little expensive.</li><li>Would definitely recommend everyone to come and try it out!* 2.5 stars* I like how the place is spacious, cozy and has plugs everywhere so it 's good for studying BUT I find the prices ridiculously overpriced though for their food.</li><li>The food used to be pretty good, but I have to say that in the past year or two, the quality has definitely dropped.</li><li>The food used to be really fresh tasting and better than other bar food.</li><li>The food used to be really fresh tasting and better than other bar food.</li><li>Now I think it has dropped to average or below average in food.</li><li>However, once we got seated, the staff was very friendly and the food ( wings) was amazing!</li><li>My only word of advice to anyone that orders wings from here is to make sure you inspect your food carefully as apparently `` hairy looking cartilage'' on your wings is a regular thing and not a big deal based on the reaction from the server when I brought it up and their lack of willingness to do anything about it.</li><li>The food is pretty good there.</li><li>Love that place has the best food ever in the world Also I had my birthday there is so cool I got ever year on my that day.</li><li>Called early to order, they had our food prepared for when we asked which was nice.</li><li>Waitresses rarely walked by to ask if we needed anything/how the food was, even though it was n't very busy.</li><li>The food was also sub-par.</li><li>Most disgusting food I 've eaten in my life, not to mention server ignored our table all night.</li><li>The food is amazing, big portions and full of flavour.</li><li>Been coming here for years and the food was great.</li><li>I really enjoyed the food.</li><li>The place is ok, food is good but the ambiance is a bit too dark to my taste.</li><li>Nice staff, good food and a nice atmosphere.</li><li>It took a while for the food to arrive but when it came we were happy.</li><li>The portions are freaking huge and the food is delicious.</li><li>This time however I am no longer a vegan so I tried the food.</li><li>I do n't care for the food, service ( was n't bad just did n't leave mark) or the atmosphere.</li><li>Good food and staff were friendly, the burgers are fantastic.</li><li>I love this place! the food is typical pub fare but I LOVE their souvlaki dishes.</li><li>Very limited parking in this dingy plaza ... upon entering this place we were not greeted by anyone at all, the cashier did n't even bother saying a single word, Infact the entire time at this place the only word that was spoken to us by the cashier and waitress combined is $ 15.50 ..... there goes their tip and customer service, we decided to just seat ourselves where a table had menus on it, the waitress did n't give us tea and ordering slip til 10mins later .... typically pho place that 's very cheap like $ 7 a dish depending on what you order The whole entire time I did n't hear a single word from the waitress and she looked so pissed off, did n't break a smile but oh well Mediocre food, nothing special and honestly I 've tasted better bun and com dishes elsewhere.</li><li>Write your order down, get your food, pay at the cash register.</li><li>Food is always consistently good and really worth your money.</li><li>They will get to you when they can and they will do it without a smile, because they know their food is the bomb and you will keep on coming back.</li><li>I 'd liken this place to `` fast food'' Pho, if one were to ever exist.</li><li>Price is reasonable, food amazing, but do n't expect much service or deco.</li><li>5 stars for food 2 stars decor 4 star service ( almost none existence.</li><li>You write the number and food comes.</li><li>My favourite pho spot in Toronto, food never disappoints and fast service.</li><li>Great service here too, make sure to check it out for fresh and tasty food!</li><li>The food also is same old.</li><li>This is my favorite type of restaurant: nondescript neighborhood, ordinary looks*, unbelievable food.</li><li>But do n't be turned down by this fact, the food is worth it.*- notice their logo is `` borrowed'' from the Laughing Cow brand:).</li><li>It was busy when we went in and true to viet restaurants we got our food super quick and easy.</li><li>Friendly service and great cheap food.</li><li>The food: This is one of the best pho places I 've been to in Toronto.</li><li>Let 's just say the focus is on the food and not on anything else. lol The service: Service was prompt, and when I asked for extra limes and basil, the waitress was n't stingy on it.</li><li>The area itself is a little `` interesting'' but the food is totally worth it.</li><li>Aside from the terrible food, they have horrible service.</li><li>If they do get your food right, the service is n't worth it.</li><li>The food is good but I 've had better at other places.</li><li>Delicious fresh food.</li><li>Food was cold, skewer was small and rice was hard and barely any in the container.</li><li>All of the food is great with great portions and prices are reasonable.</li><li>The server was so nice and the food was great!</li><li>The place is dated but the food.</li><li>Just a bad experience with the food.</li><li>First off, for the price you pay, you get mounds food.</li><li>Good food, the interior is n't the best although the good prices and even better deals make up for it.</li><li>The food, was good.</li><li>The water, the food, the bills.</li><li>( Ok, some of the food, her other staff helped, but she did n't really move down the table accept to TAKE the order, and to pick up the bills.</li><li>( It took over 40 minutes for our food to get to our table) She said `` sure'' and walked away.</li><li>Their food has really changed.</li><li>They now have a new owner and the food is really good.</li><li>Food is great.</li><li>The food is fine.</li><li>Pizza is still good, but thumbs down on the food that I tried Chicken and Ground Beef dinner plate.</li><li>The food came out and it was very average.</li><li>It reminded me of the type of food you would get at a 4 star all inclusive tropical vacation buffet.</li><li>The food is very homey and subpar i think.</li><li>Very reasonable prices and flavorful food !!</li><li>I returned a second time with my family and all immensely enjoyed their food.</li><li>I came here for my birthday with my girlfriends a couple years back and although the food was decent and ambience was really nice, our servers/waiters were really rude.</li><li>Food was good, prices reasonable.</li><li>The bill took a long time in coming .... longer than it took for the food to arrive ...</li><li>The food tastes like home cooked!</li><li>A little confusion of what we ordered and who we ordered made us waited for food that never arrived ?</li><li>What I would remember the most for my meal at El-Tipico definitely is NOT the food ...</li><li>One star is far too much for this place, have been a loyal customer for years, the food was great but now it 's just plain disgusting, they served me old spoiled ceviche for one, and their sopa de bola gets smaller Everytime I order it 's embarrassing the portions especially for the price, and they Quaker is pure water!</li><li>Amazing food!</li><li>The very tasty food make up for it.</li><li>I really liked the Food there until I pulled a long dark hair from my mouth after chewing a bite full of their food.</li><li>While we were paying, I asked my girlfriend if this would be enough food for us since we were sharing, the lady overheard and offered to give us a little more rice.</li><li>My advice would be to jump in the car and drive to local places for better food.</li><li>Never been disappointed with this chain and the food Service- mediocre.</li><li>Good healthy food for a great price.</li><li>-1 star because the food court where the restaurant is located feels like a war zone.</li><li>Decor: Elegant and a bit modern Food: They like to use catch phrases like `` organic'' and `` local'' which is more of a marketing scheme for me, but the food was good.</li><li>Decor: Elegant and a bit modern Food: They like to use catch phrases like `` organic'' and `` local'' which is more of a marketing scheme for me, but the food was good.</li><li>Review: The service was a bit slow considering their price for a meal but the food was good.</li><li>I much rather prefer the food court pumpernickel or fast fresh salads for under $ 12 but unfortunately there are n't many lunch options up near York Mills.</li><li>To sum up in Miller in one sentence: Steep prices for average food and below average service.</li><li>The food was okay, like any steakhouse.</li><li>It was fine, but I could find that kind of food at a Jack Astor 's and have better service.</li><li>Great atmosphere, great food, good service ( service level dropped a little bit through out our meal), and prices are not bad for what you get !!</li><li>We had steaks and a great bottle of pinot noir and the food was wonderful.</li><li>Great food, only to be ruined by air-conditioning !!</li><li>Went there for Mother 's Day with my daughters and friends and had a good time and the food was great.</li><li>Overall, Miller 's Tavern is great for a casual night out for decently priced food with decent quality.</li><li>The food is a bit pricey, but then again I am on a student budget.</li><li>We were very disappointed with the food.</li><li>The food was worth one star but I 'm throwing in an extra star because our waiter was nice.</li><li>Awesome service paired with awesome food!</li><li>Every time I go ( which is at least 1-2 times a month) we 're never disappointed food is outstanding, the filet mignon with mashed potatoes- to die for.</li><li>Although we were n't expecting it, and it is not necessary, most restaurants make some kind of a goodwill gesture, when they know there has been a problem with the food- a drink, a dessert, something.</li><li>The staff is always top notch, the food is too!</li><li>I gladly defer to chef 's tastes, but this is really food that I can make at home.</li><li>The food is good and the place, of course wonderful.</li><li>The food is consistently excellent!</li><li>Pretty big place, outdated in its decor, mediocre service and food is ok.</li><li>Atmosphere- this place is very outdated in its design and their food playing was also absolutely lacking.</li><li>As for the rest, friendly enough service and nice civilized vibe but it 's just a bit overpriced for what you get in terms of food.</li><li>It 's not terrible and I think I 'll come back one day but the food quality felt consistently average across the meal and that sentiment was shared by everyone at my table across a variety of different dishes.</li><li>The location is great, the food is average and the service sucks!</li><li>We visited last night for the first time ( took the in-laws as it 's a place you can actually have a quality visit and quality food).</li><li>Service is great, food is even better.</li><li>The food was good and the services good.</li><li>Prep time for food was longer than expected.</li><li>The Miller Tavern might have served me the best food I 've ever tasted in my life.</li><li>For an $ 80 brunch for two I was disappointed and will not come back for the crappy service and mediocre food.</li><li>Generally I have an excellent time here, and the serving staff and food were very good on Saturday May 9.</li><li>The food though is really good as I shared: Charcuterie Board ( $ 14)- cured &amp; smoked meats, house made pâté, mustards, pickles, and bread While I nibbled off from my friend 's: Calamari ( $ 14)- lemon mustard aïoli, chilies and Shrimp Cocktail ( $ 16) Service was not the greatness this time .... our waitress was a little cold but I was too busy having a great time with my fellow yelpers to notice.</li><li>Overall, I really enjoyed the food, drinks, ambiance and service, so definitely willing to come here more often now.</li><li>Excellent food and ambiance.</li><li>3-4 star Speaking of the food, it was meh-ok, I had a salad with chicken breast and I found the chicken to be dry and overcooked, while the salad was pretty good and well dressed.</li><li>Way overpriced for the quality of the food.</li><li>This has the worst food ever, the only thing that is edible is the Filet Mignon is the only thing that is decent.</li><li>Food is good, however I found the portions to be extremely small, especially for the price being paid !!</li><li>I have nothing to complain about, the atmosphere was good, the food was superb ( I had a steak and shrimp) and service was great.</li><li>I have n't tried much of the food ( I mainly go for cocktails), but what food I 've tried has been tasty, though not inexpensive.</li><li>I have n't tried much of the food ( I mainly go for cocktails), but what food I 've tried has been tasty, though not inexpensive.</li><li>How the Miller Tavern can charge country club prices for cafeteria food is beyond me.</li><li>We have no problem paying for good-quality, nourishing food.</li><li>Food was good, atmosphere was nice, although a little loud due to the large parties around us.</li><li>Very good service, great food and nice atmosphere.</li><li>Not so good that it smelled like cigar smoke, but we got used to it or when the food got to the table it masked the smell.</li><li>To my surprise; the food was delicious.</li><li>Restaurant was a little empty but had great service and the food was pleasant.</li><li>The new owner, Lanny is very nice, respectful and cares about his customers and the quality of the food and restaurant itself.</li><li>The food is outstanding.</li><li>The food here was pretty great.</li><li>The food was really great, as was the service!</li><li>Really great for a night out or for families, great portions and the food was delicious.</li><li>My friends had the salmon and the veal ... in their words the best food they have had.</li><li>I heartily recommend this place to any discerning lover of fine italian food.</li><li>Great food and service.</li><li>I do n't like it when restaurants try to over impress you with their food especially with Italian food because it 's all about simplicity here.</li><li>The food is truly amazing.</li><li>And the best part ? the food is AMAZING.</li><li>The food ordered was just as explained.</li><li>The food is amazing.</li><li>I 've lived in the neighbourhood my whole life and I ca n't believe I waited this long to try their food.</li><li>This is the first time we are here and I am pleasantly surprised of the quality of food and the price are a perfect match and more.</li><li>Great customer service and the food was deliciously cook.</li><li>Great food, great service.</li><li>The food and service is good.</li><li>GREAT place .... the ideal local tavern ... yet more than a tavern ... food is fabulous ... decor is nice ... great outdoor patios in nice weather ... a big improvement over the original `` Jolly Miller'' !!</li><li>Overpriced, food is bad, we ordered the soup, and the chef made a mistake and put curry powder with lots of salt, it was disgusting, and how did they attempt to make up for it ? they got us an extra desert, what a joke.</li><li>She took our drink and food orders and came back with the drinks promptly, soda for me and wine for the missus, and brought water as well.</li><li>App and food came very soon after that.</li><li>Our entrees did not come out with steak knives like some places have it so we had to flag down another waiter after sitting and staring at our food for several minutes.</li><li>I was skeptical at first when I read the not-so-good reviews, but unfortunately some of my fellow Yelpers are right -- ok food at best, but mediocre service for what 's supposed to be a country club-esque establishment.</li><li>Let 's start with the food.</li><li>The food was amazing, every single thing that we tried from the starter platter, the seafood soup, lobster thermidor ( we visited during the Lobster festival), the chocolate dessert were amazing.</li><li>Overpriced bland food and horrible service.</li><li>For good service and great food, I would always recommend this place.</li><li>Usually prix fixe deals are a rip off as you do n't get too much food.</li><li>I was pleasantly surprised at the quantity and the food was great.</li><li>Crap food, expensive, bad service ...</li><li>The service was slow, but this was due to it being very busy ( not the waiter 's fault), but when the food finally came, it was good.</li><li>The food was good both times I went, but my biggest complaint was how we were treated/seated.</li><li>The food is still not great.</li><li>The atmosphere and food are good as well as the location, but the service is pretentious and petty.</li><li>The food was great ( I got the steak salad) &amp; the prices really are n't as bad as I was expecting them to be.</li><li>It 's a cozy little restaurant, that serves pretty good food.</li><li>We received very attentive service and good food.</li><li>The food however was good.</li><li>Food was good.</li><li>No matter what you order, the food is always fresh and perfect to taste.</li><li>The food was not worth the price we paid.</li><li>Maybe the food quality was better for other Yelp reviewers, but our first visit was not good.</li><li>Overall, space was great but the food lacked a balance of essential ingredients.</li><li>The food: 10/10 Their sashimi are always fresh.</li><li>Decent food here.</li><li>The food itself was passable but not great.</li><li>Not just because the owner is friend of my dad but the food there is pretty good.</li><li>Their Tofu dinner is also very delicious &amp; a more reasonable price for the amount of food you get.</li><li>Friendly service, and even more amazing food.</li><li>The food were great!</li><li>I 'm here right now and have n't gotten my food since my order AN HOUR AGO.</li><li>The food was excellent.</li><li>However the food was fresh and very tasty.</li><li>Excellent food and service!</li><li>I went there with my husband with two other friends on Tuesday December 20th and the service and food was great.</li><li>What sets this place apart is the attention to details on the food, and the freshness of their fish.</li><li>The food was great, I was full afterwards and I did n't feel like there was too much rice which seems to be a common issue with most sushi places.</li><li>The servers were friendly, we got our food pretty quickly.</li><li>The food were decent and reasonably priced.</li><li>The rest of the food is great too, but if you 're having any trouble ordering, get the tempura.</li><li>The food here was yummy for also a great value.</li><li>The owner seems to be trying to cut down food costs to the bare minimum- if you put three pieces of paneer in it you can still legally call it mutter paneer right and not be sued for false advertising I suppose.</li><li>The food again is lacking any kind of spice or taste.</li><li>Owner is down to earth and food is always fresh.</li><li>I can say that while the food is as you 'd expect from an average Indian restaurant, the level of professionalism and general customer service etiquette is simply nonexistent.</li><li>2/5, because the food is n't bad, and the naan are great.</li><li>P. S. They never have the chaat/bhel puri snacks even though they advertise them on the wall. cheap food and cheap customer service. they haggled with me over replacing a curry overloaded with salt!</li><li>First the food- some of their dishes taste really good and are really well prepared.</li><li>Their food is good in the morning and afternoon but usually stale and cold towards closing hours in the evening.</li><li>Signs, for instance, clarifying what kind of food you have to order so you can sit there and eat, or how you ca n't pay with any pennies or how to eat a wrap.</li><li>All in all, I give it a 3.5/5 for the times when their food is so good that everything else comes second.</li><li>Even when we went there for a turkey dinner one Thanksgiving, when it was rather busy, the food was still perfectly cooked.</li><li>While it is a little on the pricier side, if you need a reasonably priced, but classy experience with a variety of food to serve different tastes, Anthony 's is a place to eat at. do n't be fooled by the white linen table cloths. this place is crap crap &amp; more crap !!</li><li>`` Cool'' or `` hip'' would no doubt be the last words used to describe this place- but in the end, it 's all about the food for me ...</li><li>The food is somewhat blah, and greasy, and not put together nicely.</li><li>But it 's food.</li><li>When we finally got our order through and got our food, the food tasted as bad as it looked.</li><li>When we finally got our order through and got our food, the food tasted as bad as it looked.</li><li>Overall, I found the food to be ' meh'- nothing to write home about.</li><li>I used to come here all the time, food is awesome, service is great but after the renovation I found out they are NO LONGER HALAL, which sucks.</li><li>The place is more of a sit in and have your food, I ordered Spicy burger with Taters Poutine.</li><li>Food is a lot better than I expected, especially because its Hallal.</li><li>If you 're willing to overlook some questionable hygiene and outdated decor for some great food, Orly 's would be recommended without reservation.</li><li>Great food and big portions.</li><li>He bothers me so much I 'm apprehensive about returning when he works otherwise the food is worth every penny.</li><li>Good food and good prices!</li><li>Whaaat so much food!</li><li>You order at the counter and they take the food to your table.</li><li>I used to enjoy the food here, but poor hygiene was a major turn off.</li><li>This is good, healthy, solid, basic fare without any hype or pretence. nice try but russian food is not authentic middle eastern food! not what i was looking for at all. they have some `` middle eastern style'' dishes but like i said, not authentic. definitely not going back.</li><li>If food was all I 'm basing my stars on, then this little hole-in-a-wall would easily garner 5 if them.</li><li>I really want to return for the food.</li><li>The food is the best.</li><li>With a reasonable price ( between 5-20 $) you get a delicious food in a high quality.</li><li>It 's a bit of a hole in the wall and it was generally quiet there back then but this time I 'm back, it brighten up, a lot busier and the food is as good as ever.</li><li>It bothered me a bit until the food came, then I did n't care anymore.</li><li>No fast food practice here.</li><li>The food is great--we 've never branched out from the sandwiches, but the shawarma and falafel are crispy and flavourful and there are plenty of pickled toppings available to tart up the sweet tahini and garlic sauces.</li><li>The food is always made to order so it 's fresh!</li><li>2/5 the food is not bad, delicious actually but honestly the dinner portions are average at best, making me think they are inconsistent since others have said that they are huge.</li><li>I guess it is a polarizing place, isnt it ? lesson is that if you like declicious take out at a reasonable price, go here, if you like a cultural experience in a sit down place that is nice and has good food for a good price, go to suliko ..</li><li>The wait time here could be quite long compared to other sharwama joints, where I waited around 15mins for my food.</li><li>The food was sub-par especially for a chain restaurant where I would normally expect something close to the taste I get at the 3 other locations I have dined at.</li><li>I then ate some of our appetizer alone with obviously just a fee chips and we had to wait another 30 minutes for our food to come.</li><li>But the veggie sticks were just out of the fridge ( or freezer, since our plates have been sitting on a counter in their kitchen for so long) The server, Rafael, was nice and apologized to us for being late with our food.</li><li>Kelsey 's is a fairly typical restaurant with average food.</li><li>Typical chain restaurant food.</li><li>I think the food was good.</li><li>The food ?</li><li>The food is average, the menu is simple with burgers, chicken fingers, pasta 's and chicken.</li><li>Food was OK and the wait staff was possibly the 3:30 pm clientele recruited at the last minute to fill-in for the `` C'' team.</li><li>The food was great!</li><li>Come here every now and then if I just want to sit down, relax, have a couple beers, watch some hockey and eat some bar food for dinner if I do n't want to cook anything.</li><li>The food is decent.</li><li>If that was fast I would hate to see a `` slow menu'' Although the food was adequate the service was terrible.</li><li>The waiter was very nice and the food was very similar unlike the scarborough location.</li><li>The service is good and the food and drinks are good.</li><li>Good food, service, atmosphere, and reasonably priced given it 's a steak house.</li><li>They had really large portions and the food was great.</li><li>Sorry but not paying a company to be mean to me and deliver disgustingly cold food.</li><li>And do n't worry keep the cold food and I will not order again.</li><li>Horrible food but even worst by far, was the service and the higher up I complained, the more annoyed dominoes seemed to be telling me well they cannot control franchises.</li><li>Just some food for though, Baton Rouge.</li><li>I am trying to follow the rule of not ordering seafood main courses in steakhouses and vice versa, so my only experience with their food are steaks and ribs.</li><li>Not only did it take 20 minutes for someone to come take our order, they did n't get my order right, and some of our food was n't even hot.</li><li>I 've been to a couple other locations of Baton Rouge and the food has always been great.</li><li>She seemed shocked and checked on the food.</li><li>Once you receive your food it only gets better, everything is cooked to perfection.</li><li>The name suggested that I would be getting cajun/creole food.</li><li>No no no. It lacks any hint of authentic Louisiana food.</li><li>The service was good, but the food just did n't match up.</li><li>The food is good as any location but the service each time I 've gone here has been lacking.</li><li>Seems like they had a staff overhaul because this time the food was cooked properly and it was actually tasty.</li><li>Having said that- the food was pretty mediocre and very overpriced for what it was.</li><li>The food is bland everything was horrible!</li><li>The food was horrible and they did n't have much selection.</li><li>Better quality food in the area.</li><li>The food came out hot and fast!</li><li>Food was quite tasty and I really enjoyed it considering my favourite thing to order from Baton Rouge is their chipotle chicken sandwich.</li><li>Service has never been bad and food is consistent.</li><li>The food was pretty good, but it took too long to come out, we then waited for the bill for more than 10 mins like they are cooking it back in the kitchen or Somthing!</li><li>Menu prices look high but you get a pile of food.</li><li>The name itself is a bit deceptive for those who might think this serves up food tending towards more authentic Louisiana/gulf coast type cuisine.</li><li>Over all I 'd give the food a neutral Cha-Ka ( http://static2.px.yelpcdn.com/photo/GdMtUPz_ AkYaAXBHOuj_ Ag/l) but service, portion sizes, the chain 's avoidance of Outbacking it up for yucks with dumb menu names, and for a varied group with varied tastes this will least offend, that brings the experience up to a shaka zulu ( http://static4.px.yelpcdn.com/photo/xEteN-dt9mpHha1Fyq1U6w/l).</li><li>If I worked in this box store abyss, this would definitely be a lunch staple for me. fast food chinese.</li><li>The place is small and a bit dingy, but whatever, the food is good, fast and cheap!</li><li>Delivery was fast, food mediocre but my PHO order did n't come with garnishes not cutlery or sauces ... small details make a difference.</li><li>The food came with gravy spilt all over my items ... one dish seaping into the other.</li><li>After all the trouble ... the food was bland.</li><li>Very average food.</li><li>The new chairs &amp; tables are far more spacious than the old cramped fast food attached chair &amp; tables which preceded them.</li><li>There is a mustard &amp; ketchup station with push buttons slightly to the left of the Wendy 's ordering counter, but salt, pepper and plastic cutlery are no longer longer available at this station; you have to ask counter staff for those items, which is NOT IMO an improvement, given this is a very busy restaurant all the time, always line ups, as we who live in Weston have few dining options;_; ( For God 's sake, food franchises &amp; restaurant chains, take pity on Weston- Lawrence &amp; open up some businesses here!)</li><li>The food was mostly acceptable.</li><li>I would recommend any other Pakistani place since the food here is pretty generic.</li><li>Was there this morning for breakfast, terrible food, slow service.</li><li>Food is always great and they are able to customize your order depending on how spicy you would like your food.</li><li>Food is always great and they are able to customize your order depending on how spicy you would like your food.</li><li>It cost $ 15 bucks, way too pricey for poor quality

!! the food is just great!</li><li>Naan was also pretty good but the rest of the food just did n't do it for me.</li><li>To be honest, the food is pretty good, even though you ca n't see them prepare much of it.</li><li>The food is good, but there 's definitely room to improve when it comes to customer service.</li><li>As for the taste of the food was concerned, it was good but not amazing.</li><li>The food was extremely delicious, and the restaurant was clean and well-organized.</li><li>I have allergies to peanuts and nuts and notified the lady when I ordered food and she said both items had peanuts and they would n't be taken out since they were mixed in the sauce.</li><li>Mind you to be fair the food I was able to eat was well cooked and tasted good.</li><li>This is a place with really decent food.</li><li>The food here is amazing.</li><li>My previous review, I ripped this place for the ridiculous amount of salad they gave out here with their food.</li><li>The amount we received for $ 50 worth of food was insulting, the fact that they expect 4 people to share this is ridiculous.</li><li>I was in Toronto for 4 days and I went there twice as the food was excellent.</li><li>The service is also quick, weve never had to wait long at all and all food is always fresh and hot.</li><li>The food is amazing, great portions and well priced.</li><li>The food is fresh of the grill and very reasonably priced.</li><li>Before we ordered our food bread was offered in a plastic bag and in the bag was fruitflies.</li><li>I 'm pretty sure the food might be good but the cleanliness was definitely subpar.</li><li>The food is great, and service is great too.</li><li>But aside from this complaint, I have to say the food is very delicious and good for the price.</li><li>The waitress was very nice and friendly, the food was really great compare to the price.</li><li>The food is not bad, my 1 star review is about the billing and cheque system .im not sure why are they charging more than their own price list!</li><li>The portion sizes are great, and the service is okay, but more than make up for it with the quality of the food!:) Try a cup of tea after dinner ... it will hit the spot!</li><li>The food gets almost five stars except for a rather short menu.</li><li>Been going to Darband since it opened about 15 years ago, and over the years as owners have changed so has the quality of the food and service.</li><li>I am happy to say that as of late the food has been outstanding.</li><li>The food is very good.</li><li>Great place for the fatty food craving after a night of drinking.</li><li>I ordered the koobideh for take out and I was thrilled at the amount of food I got for less than $ 10.</li><li>Love that they are open 24/7 without compromising their food.</li><li>Even at 12 am the restaurant was full which is likely due to their great reputation for serving quality food.</li><li>Not the best service in the world but it 's definitely overshadowed by the great food.</li><li>Good quality food, good prices and great quantities.</li><li>The food is OK and the price is good.</li><li>It was pretty busy for a Saturday night take out at 6:30 pm and considering I had called in my order some 30 min before going to pick it up, I did not expect to wait as long as I did ( some additional 20 min) to get my food.</li><li>I 'll continue to come to Darband or our Persian kabob fix unless I stumble upon a new joint closer to home and serving up just as good food.</li><li>It 's 24hr and the food is always fresh!</li><li>Good food, good service.</li><li>The food &amp; service was excellent.</li><li>I tried the chicken kebab and the Barg with rice, I have to admit that it was the most delicious food that I 've had among all the other Persian restaurants so far in Toronto area.</li><li>While initially the service was not very fast ( took a while to get our menus), after we had ordered the food came VERY quickly.</li><li>Darband is for sure going to be a place that we 're going back to for some great and tasty Persian food.</li><li>I would like to tell you how I liked the food here, but sadly cannot.</li><li>The customer service was very poor and so was the food.</li><li>I will never buy their food again !!! cheap place to get korean food but they use way too much msg. the interior is really old and dirty. but bc they use so much msg i got addicted to their kimchi fried rice. one of the lady 's washroom is alway broken ( i think they are fixing it on purpose) and their ingredients ( like packs of rice) are in the hall connected to the rear exit. i just find this place not clean. i 'd go somewhere else.</li><li>I will never buy their food again !!! cheap place to get korean food

was their downfall.</li><li>But this was decent food with good portions &amp; prices.</li><li>Food tasted good &amp; it was fresh too.</li><li>Great food, great service.</li><li>It 's not much to look at on the outside, and the inside is cluttered and a little dated, but the staff ( owners ?) are friendly and knowledgeable about what they 're serving and the food 's good.</li><li>I can taste the classic style food here.</li><li>Nor does it have the same presentation to the food.</li><li>Not addressing the server 's bare-hand handling of cash and food was particularly classy. popped in here for a NY Style deli sandwich and recommendations on Yelp. as soon as you walk in you can tell it 's a wonderful family business.</li><li>Excellent variety of food and sushi and the space is cozy but inviting.</li><li>The service is bad, food is worse, and priced well above what other ( better) places charge.</li><li>The food was n't bad but when things on the menu are n't what they seem, we have a bit of a problem here.</li><li>The food here never disappointed me and is worth the price.</li><li>I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere as well as the food.</li><li>The food is excellent.</li><li>It has a wide selection of great food from the raw fish to the cooked entrees and everything in between.</li><li>There is something for everyone on this menu and well worth the little extra for the freshness of the food.</li><li>Even at the end of the night their food is always fresh, including the miso soup and edamame which can sit around and get old.</li><li>I love their staff and service ( although it can get quite busy on holidays and weekends), the atmosphere is simple and homey, the food is always great.</li><li>Pretty good in terms of quality of food and service.</li><li>Fast service the food is always fresh and delicious they can make anything on the menu just the way you like it and the portions are just perfect for sharing so you can order multiple items to share.</li><li>The food was alright.</li><li>The food here is pretty decent ( well at least the bento teriyaki combo I ordered).</li><li>The food was AMAZING.</li><li>Spacious parking dining area, friendly service, average food, accepts credit card = 3.5 stars Ordered Love boat A ( ~ $ 31).</li><li>It was enough food for two of us.</li><li>They used to be good but their food doesnt seem as fresh nowadays also their bulgoki is not fully cooked ( you can see the red).</li><li>The food was average, just average.</li><li>The food is decent.</li><li>The food is great, fresh and the service is awesome, normally.</li><li>I thought the food was pretty decent.</li><li>My husband and I love sushi and we 've been having trouble finding a place in north york that is reasonably priced, with good atmosphere and delicious food ...</li><li>Food are ok but there was absolutely zero service.</li><li>My brother in law brought us to Sam Jung after my husband and I arrived on Christmas Eve aka limited food options before our annual family gift exchange gathering.</li><li>Such nice staffs, such terrible food.</li><li>There is pride in their work and it reflects on the food served.</li><li>If I wanted day old food I coulda just stayed at home and ate leftovers, but instead I made the mistake of coming here.</li><li>Honestly I have been around this area for quite a while and I wonder how this place has been open for all these years when the food is atrocious.</li><li>Good quality and good price and they are really on-time. definite a must go place if you 're looking for japanese/korean food in the area. very friendly service staff .... ambiance is great. more importantly, food is amazing at least compared to the other japanese restaurant within the neighborhood. tempura is a must have.</li><li>Good quality and good price and they are really on-time. definite a must go place if you 're looking for japanese/korean food in the area. very friendly service staff

was maybe 3 stars.</li><li>The food was n't cheap.</li><li>They 're a little pricey but the effort they put into making sure the customers are delighted, I think the prices of the food were just right.</li><li>The service is fast, friendly, and welcoming and the food is absolutely delicious and flavorful.</li><li>I love the relaxed atmosphere here with comfy seats and awesome food.</li><li>The order the food came was the main dishes first.</li><li>Great place to share food and chit chat.</li><li>As for the food we ordered hummus ( approx $ 6), veggie pizza ( $ 5.99), lamb plate ( $ 18.99), mixed meat plate ( $ 20.99) and falafel ( 0.99).</li><li>I 'm not exactly a Middle Eastern food expert but I had a pleasurable experience at Paramount fine food and would definitely dine again at this chain.</li><li>Both items included some pickles and garlic sauce ( which was amazing) The food was hot, fresh, and tasty.</li><li>We did n't need to wait too long for food, were checked in at least once, and had our waters refilled too.</li><li>Their food is always fresh and the staff is super friendly!</li><li>Love these little hole in the wall joints with no advertising, no large billboard ... you know the food has to be good enough for them to survive through just word of mouth.</li><li>This is the place to go if you want cheap delicious food!</li><li>The price of the food here is excellent.</li><li>Excellent prices, great food- cant ask for more.</li><li>K. is a very entertaining fellow, for one he was mad at my friend for introducing me to the shop saying that he 's already so busy making food for the customers and now I 'm going to become another addict!</li><li>On to the food, the jerk chicken sandwich is maybe the best I 've had.</li><li>Bottom line: the food was really yummy and really cheap.</li><li>Just plain and simple mouth watering food served at this small little place.</li><li>The food at Allwyn 's, especially the jerk chicken sandwiches, is ' highly addictive' just like the part owner C. K. will warn you during your first visit.</li><li>Delicious food !!</li><li>I just had a catered lunch by the Chicken Nest and the food was well prepared and presented.</li><li>The food is always fresh and Paolo treats every customer as if they 're family.</li><li>The food was n't AMAZING, but the fact that I payed $ 13 and change including tax and tip for a gigantic pasta and gigantic wine is enough to bring me back.</li><li>The gentleman who owns the place and makes the food was really the highlight of this place and would be the reason I would keep coming back.</li><li>So yes, this food IS made with love, because this gentleman who runs the place is lovely and has a true pride in his food.</li><li>So yes, this food IS made with love, because this gentleman who runs the place is lovely and has a true pride in his food.</li><li>The food was portioned according to its price.</li><li>Left Bank Bistro is a good choice if you are looking somewhere for some decent food and a great price point !!</li><li>The first time was great, they had just opened, the service was good and the food reasonable.</li><li>However, the service and food declined with each experience it seems.</li><li>Normally if the food is alright I will forget about all else, but the food was really awful.</li><li>Normally if the food is alright I will forget about all else, but the food was

presentation.</li><li>The middle eastern cuisine, fresh food, quality best and the service 10/ 10.</li><li>You pay at the counter then they bring your food to your seat.</li><li>Overall, the food was pretty good.</li><li>Pros Great Dessert Good food Not really any service Cons Meat came after the salad Looked stupid waiting for the waiter to take our order ... will look cool next time i guess.</li><li>Food took forever and it was bland.</li><li>Where do I start, ok the food.</li><li>With 8 people back at our table and two of us trying to manage to order the drinks and food for everyone, I was exhausted and frustrated.</li><li>And when there was no room to put anymore plates on the table, the staff handed the food to us !!</li><li>As for the food, the dipping appetizers were very tasty, but all the meats were dry, the tabuli rough and crunchy and the service was absolutely ABYSMAL.</li><li>Really good food.</li><li>I would n't go back again unless I was desperate for quick food.</li><li>Ambience: nice for a fast food middle eastern place.</li><li>The food is dry and burnt.</li><li>I wonder if that 's just the way this food is ....</li><li>I told him this is a restaurant I should n't be walking around to order my food this is extremely weird. the people behind me we 're all laughing and agreeing with me. throughout the time we were there people coming in were confused when they were told about the ordering method.</li><li>I thought the food might be good since there are so many people inside .....</li><li>I ordered kabobs with rice and girlfriend ordered chicken shawarma with rice. my food was bland and the shawarma had curry taste.</li><li>Overall the food was good and the service was very good.</li><li>I 've been to other locations and the food was sub-par.</li><li>Food was alright but they make you pay before you start eating, never seen that before.</li><li>Decent food, we order often since not many UberEATS options in the area.</li><li>The food tastes good, is presented fairly well, but is a bit on the pricey side.</li><li>You 're seated by a host/server and given a menu but you have to go up to the cashier to order and prepay for your food.</li><li>The food is brought to the table by a server.</li><li>Place has been open for a while now while the food is `` ok'' I do not understand how the service ( even though friendly) can be so chaotic.</li><li>They stood patiently until the food was delivered to them to be packed up for you while reconfirming you that it would just take `` 2 more minutes''.</li><li>Given that in the area there are many many other places that serve the same type of food I will not be returning.</li><li>With the food, prices, and ambiance, this is definitely a welcome addition to the area being that there is n't much around here to get too excited about.</li><li>The food itself was `` meh'', there are bazillion places around the city that serve a better bbq chicken, the pizza is basically marinara and a few pieces of pepperoni on a pita.</li><li>The food was FRESH- easily the BEST Middle Eastern Food I have had in a LONG time.</li><li>We went to order our food and a gentleman who appeared to be the manager on duty took our order at the register.</li><li>I had ordered a tabbouleh salad with a side of chicken skewers and when the server brought our food I was served a fattoush salad with the chicken so I told her that it was n't what I had ordered and she brought it back to her manager who seemed confused then a few minutes later she came back with my food.</li><li>I had ordered a tabbouleh salad with a side of chicken skewers and when the server brought our food I was served a fattoush salad with the chicken so I told her that it was n't what I

for similar food which is better and is either full service or fast food.</li><li>This is not middle eastern food.</li><li>While I found the food to be tasty, and enjoyable I did not appreciate the shell shock I received when I got my bill.</li><li>Food was quite good, but over-priced.</li><li>You pay at a counter and they bring the food to you.</li><li>I enjoyed the food, albeit a littleeee on the pricier side.</li><li>Business Model- 2 stars As much as I love the food, I wish I did n't have to go up to the counter to order.</li><li>Food is okay but service is terrible.</li><li>The food 's decent, if a litlte pricey for breakfast ( the area really needs a pure breakfast restaurant, like a Cora 's).</li><li>The Friendly Greek 's food and service have impressed me the times I 've visited.</li><li>I 'm no expert, but the food I 've had here seems to be on par with some of the better Greek offerings in Toronto.</li><li>It would probably only rank 3.5 stars ( if that was an option) but it gets bonus points for being one of the few places in the Yonge &amp; Shepperd area that has good tasting, high quality food that is reasonably priced.</li><li>Wonderful food, a very homey feel at a decent price.</li><li>The decor is nothing fancy so dont be surprised on your first time coming in but the food more than makes up for it.</li><li>If you are in the area and dont want the typical fast food I highly suggest to try it out.</li><li>The decor is outdated but the food hit the spot!</li><li>Nothing fancy at all but the food is classic.</li><li>Six of us had a very nice time and really liked our food at Alegno 's.</li><li>The service was perfect and the food delicious.</li><li>During the wait for our food, my daughter was asking us to have some bread, so we asked if we can get a basket of bread or dinner rolls for our daughter ( which another table have already).</li><li>Overall, horrible service, food just average, and it was overpriced for what we got, and NOT family friendly at all!</li><li>Final note: I went to this restaurant over 15 years ago, and I remember the food AND service was much better back then.</li><li>You get your food and eat it and at least all the food we ordered are decent.</li><li>When I went to Italy I was expecting all of the food to be as good as, if not better than what I had at Alegno.</li><li>The food truly is exceptional!</li><li>It 's a small place and entirely family run, so the service is sometimes slow and they will sometimes run out of specials, because I guess they make only so many/night, but that just proves the family-run business atmosphere and the homemade food.</li><li>Still, the food is so amazing and fresh, I still give this place FIVE STARS ALL DAY, SON!*****. the place is very clean. the fish i had was very fresh and the batter was very crispy. we also ordered the chicken pie which was good but the pie was taken out of the fridge in front of us and taken to the cook to be heated up. nothing special about the pie, a bit expensive in my opinion. it cost more than the fish. chips, fish and whatever has to be ordered separately. we did get free slices of brown bread with butter on the side. i just wish that they give a bit more on the plate than just a fish. weird.</li><li>It is a great asset to the Don Mills area, selling delicious food for good prices while not relying on pretentious decor or hosts.</li><li>The food was terrific, perfectly battered haggis and black pudding rounds along with well done fries.</li><li>Great quality food and a nice, variable menu.</li><li>Food was good, waitress a little funny steering us certain ways ( We have Guinness, but not on tap.</li><li>Food was very good and satisfied all ages.</li><li>Food was generally good.</li><li>Over all, a nice place but if we come back, we 'll be sure to order something different next time! ok it 's no fluke the wood oven pizza here is very good. ( we ordered two kinds to try) the dough, sauce and cheese the base ingredients of most any pizza are top notch. the crust i would describe .. it 's not a thin where it 's paper thin and it 's not cooked crisp like I 've had at many other thin crust pizza places. having its so crisp hides the true identity of the pizza dough. how can one taste the crust if it 's burnt !? the crust is thin where one can bite into the dough know it 's dough and not thick enough to not overwhelm the toppings. my quattro stagione was made wrong though .. it suppose to be separate quarters of pizza with the individual toppings. but instead it was a pizza with all the toppings. c 'mon just because I do n't look italian does n't mean I do n't know how it 's suppose to be. do n't give me stupid excuses that things get roughed up in the oven that why that make it that way ? i do n't care for the chatty waitress here and the ridiculous excuses, but as i mentioned in my first review. i will come here for the food because the cooks and chefs in the back know what they are doing ..</li><li>I 'd definitely go back to this restaurant again to try out their other menu items. family owned italian restaurant. short summary: very yummy food, portions could be bigger, sometimes slow service but very friendly lady owner, always packed at lunch, which is frustrating since they dont accept reservations. longer summary: the decoration of the restaurant is very cozy and gives a feeling of a patio dining even though it 's all indoors. the service though slow is very friendly and we often end up chatting with the owner for few minutes while we 're waiting for the order. it usually gets very packed at lunch by the people from surrounding office buildings. and since they do n't accept reservations sometimes it means that you have to arrive right after the doors are open ( which is 1130am everyday I think) in general very welcoming place but a bit on a pricey side.</li><li>The food is same as any other South Street.</li><li>I agree that they have a nice location, inside Bayview Village with nice ambience But once we lined up for the food, we realized that there are some foundamental problems 1.</li><li>The food is edible for fast food crowd and hungry family, but not for people who care about food or clean places.</li><li>The food is way over priced and mediocre at best ..</li><li>Sometimes, you just want a glass of vino with your burger to step it up a notch and take your McDonald-like experience to a whole new level. great burgerBUT messed up my order even tho the large foot tall number token was very obvious. had to leav- left beer- king east location- rap music and noise level was so loud I was shocked no one complained. fries and burger tasty hate that the service was non apparent must line up to order- no table ordering food no condiments on table or napkins even! pros- meal `` deal''. came to 14 $ for small jr burger a fry and a beer. not sure that 's a deal.</li><li>Love the vast selection of toppings ... makes up for the price of the food.</li><li>This comes from my philosophy that burgers and fries are not `` real food''.</li><li>I 've been to South Street 3 times with a groupon and all I can say is that the quality of the food depends on the person making it.</li><li>The place is pretty clean, quick service and alot of room to sit. only thing is cash order area where cash is a bit small, not alot of people can fit but it good food.</li><li>Being at Bayview Village with higher end food establishments with superior service, getting a premium burger without the service does n't seem right.</li><li>The food in definitely Eastern European and not every Canadian may like it, but my Russian friends approve of the quality.</li><li>I 'll be honest, the food here was mediocre depending on what you 're having.</li><li>There are plenty of other places that serve the same food and even better, but that will happily serve you.</li><li>The food is alright, but not delicious, with tacky music playing loud enough to be impossible to ignore.</li><li>The food was served hot.</li><li>Back to the 80s.:) I would say it 's a place with good food and not fancy interior.</li><li>Mediocre food, service is horrible.</li><li>You are basically there for the good food.</li><li>While the decor may not be appealing, the food is a different take.</li><li>Lots of regulars, which speaks volume for its food quality and consistency.</li><li>You come here for the food.</li><li>Located in the Bayview Woods Plaza ( for those who do n't know, it 's literally in the middle of the `` woods'' as it 's along the Finch Greenbelt), this restaurant is like restaurants you see in HK that focus a lot more on the food than the décor; there literally is no decorations in this restaurant.</li><li>As for the food, we had seafood fried chow mein noodle, mixed mushrooms fried ho-fan noodle, fish congee ( forgot which kind), and mushrooms mixed with pickle ( yes I know, lots of mushrooms).</li><li>As long as you can wave someone down, order, get your food, and ask for the bill, that 's all I ask for in terms of these establishments.</li><li>3.5 If you 're looking for a decent Chinese experience without all of the fluff, Sun Star is a place you might want to check out Pros: Food is pretty good Prices are OK Cons: Portions are smaller If you do n't know about this place, chances are you will never see it even if you 're driving by.</li><li>The food is decent to pretty good and the prices are OK as well.</li><li>Like I said, the food is pretty good.</li><li>The place itself is not a lost cause, but food definitely could have been better.</li><li>The lady that served us, seemed uninterested, but the food came quick and it was delicious.</li><li>Cooking style is also very hk oriented ( not the north American chinese cuisine style with the chop suey crap) pricing is pretty decent with many dishes under $ 10 and food comes out quick and tasty.</li><li>The place is nothing fancy to look at but who cares when the food tastes this good and prices are so reasonable.</li><li>Great food with that home-cooked taste and served fast at a decent price!</li><li>The food is presented at a ' steam table' with all the choices pre-cooked and help at a good eating temperature.</li><li>I 'm pretty sure the food was sitting out for the whole day because it was cold and chewy.</li><li>Dishing out simple, classic, flavourful Italian food reasonably priced and portioned!</li><li>Food is passable but not the most flavourful.</li><li>However, i came here for the food.</li><li>The food was awesome.</li><li>They kicked us out in the middle of eating saying they had to close right on the dot and were n't willing to let us finish our food.</li><li>After we ordered our food and sat down she yelled at the guy who made our food for letting us in saying it was too close to closing but we actually had 20 mins.</li><li>After we ordered our food and sat down she yelled at the guy who made our food for letting us in saying it was too close to closing but we actually had 20 mins.</li><li>Food was also blahhh ..</li><li>The food is tasteless and I do n't know why I gave this place a second try, now I 'm paying for it.</li><li>This food is SH* T!</li><li>I do n't think there will ever be any compelling reason for me to ever want to have it again, this would n't even pass for hangover food.</li><li>After about 10 mins wait, the food finally arrived.</li><li>There is no passion in the food they produce and you can tell they absolutely have no clue on what it takes to run a good burrito joint.</li><li>I do n't know how much it costs because it was a group purchase but the food was alright.</li><li>It was hot and full of ingredients, a lil messy but I 'm a fan of messy food, it 's usually the tastiest.</li><li>Bland food, overcooked, sometimes burnt ( nachos).</li><li>I rarely buy food for lunch during the work week.</li><li>However, there are those days when I am craving some outside food, and last week, I was CRAVING for a heavy, carby, burrito.</li><li>Was in the area for training and needed to grab food, so decided to go with a burrito bowl.</li><li>Passable food; too bad about all the styrofoam packaging!</li><li>What was n't burnt tasted like Taco Bell anyway, but at least I was never served burnt food at Taco Bell.</li><li>The food is really nothing worth mentioning.</li><li>My 1st. visit to this mock Tex-Mex bistro did nothing to give me confidence that I was going to enjoy the food ...</li><li>I had lived in Texas, Oklahoma and Arizona .... but the food resembled nothing that I had eaten in my feisty younger days.</li><li>The food was n't bad by any stretch but it felt like a step step down even from the major burrito chains ( like the Boyz).</li><li>The food is here typical for what you would find at your typical Mexican fast food eatery.</li><li>I liked the food here, not a busy place.</li><li>Basically so I do n't spend too much time on this review as it took the same time to eat the meal ..... the food was lousy.</li><li>I 'm glad to see I was n't the only one who thought their food literally sucks.</li><li>Great food, but you do n't build your own burrito they have them pre-packaged.</li><li>But again the food was great made up for the suprise.</li><li>MAybe because i love to drown my food in hot sauce i find it delicious.</li><li>The food is fair and the atmosphere is pleasant enough.</li><li>Food was good but the server was rude and made me never want to go back !!!</li><li>We ventured up to Avenue Road with a Travel Zoo voucher ( $ 49 for 2 prix fixe dinners) in hand for a night of delightful food.</li><li>Its either the portion sizes are too small, the food is mediocre, or we are treated differently than regular-paying customers.</li><li>To my surprise, the portion sizes here were generous, the food pleased even my ever-so-critical parents, and the service, though pretty lacking in the earlier part of the evening improved drastically towards the end.</li><li>The prices here are quite reasonable for the quality of food you get and I will definitely be back.</li><li>It has also usurped Trapper 's as our go-to restaurant for Winter/Summerlicious- another tradition that we never miss. As I mentioned, the service was a little lacklustre but the food will more than make up for it.</li><li>Having a great, friendly, informative staff is something that will keep customers coming back ... and of course, the food has to be good!</li><li>As I mentioned, the staff were amazing and the food was even better!</li><li>Tutto Pronto is great hidden gem that deserves to be recognized for great service and remarkable food.</li><li>I came with a large party and it was thoroughly enjoyable- good wine choices, hearty food, helpful service.</li><li>If you love good homestyle Italian meals or if you hate cooking and want to grab some great tasting food to go, Tutto Pronto will certainly have something delicious to feed you or your family with the taste of homemade goodness.</li><li>Just do n't tell my mom that I think their food is just as good if not better than hers!</li><li>As for the food, their beef cappacchio was excellent, and the Caprese Salad was also very tasty.</li><li>Plating is likewise sad ... food just appears slapped onto the plates.</li><li>The food was good but the service was the worst ever.</li><li>My friend is a doctor and I 'm a franchise owner, we definitely have enough money to pay for our food.</li><li>First off, that was wayyyyyyyy too much food for a sane person.</li><li>Two healthy dudes, we barely finished half the food.</li><li>I definitely will go back here next time i crave some Phlip food.</li><li>Food is great, service is great.</li><li>First time have dinner there with my husband, we ordered a dinner for two which comes with wings &amp; rolls to start, then a combination plate with BBQ chicken &amp; pork, and we asked for upgrad a steam rich into garlic rich ..... the BBQ meats are very good condition, a man who looks very nice and I believed he is the owner of the restaurant told me they fresh cook the food by order, no msg ~ ~ that 's a good selling point.</li><li>The food was the best Filipino food I 've had in such a long time .... better than Remely 's or Max 's. the price is affordable and the portions humongous.</li><li>Great food with great prices!</li><li>I got take out a few times after as well and the food was just as good take out!</li><li>Always love the food, but recently they put in a weird rule.</li><li>Seating was a bit cramped, had a cafeteria vibe and we felt like our neighbors were staring either at us ( who stuck out a bit from the Filipino crowd) or our food.</li><li>The food came fairly quickly ( thank god)- nice and hot.</li><li>The food is okie dokie but nothing good enough to fantasize about instantly when you 're hungry.</li><li>First time having filipino food, not having much expectation, it made me fell in love with Filipino food.</li><li>As a Chinese, I always thought filipino food will be too exotic and flavourful but it actually tasted almost just like Chinese food.</li><li>Despite that, the food is legit!</li><li>Since I was with a regular of Sampaguita Village, I left the ordering to the expert and ended up we shared: BBQ Chicken ( $ 4.95) Pancit Sampaguita ( $ 11.95) Spicy Shrimp ( $ 11.55) The food was tasty and portion size was more than enough for 3 of us to share.</li><li>The food here is authentic small-town province Filipino food.</li><li>The customer service was great, but the food was even better!</li><li>Maybe it 's okay if you want the nostalgia of the karenderia that I went to in the Philippines but I have never enjoyed the Experience of those places I just wanted the food.</li><li>A very tiny place but absolutely amazing food!</li><li>The sparse and rather sterile environment was somehow warm and enticing: the sizzle of food cooking, the laughter and hum of conversations and the smiles on people 's faces added much to the otherwise drab settings.</li><li>While the food was very fresh and tasty, the lack of sauce made the meal a tad dry.</li><li>If you are craving fast, fresh, cheap, delicious food this is the spot.</li><li>Terrible food, please DO NOT eat here! one of the worst places I 've ever eaten in my life, the place and the food had a horrible smell, I will never ever go to this nasty place again, I had to throw away all the food because I was afraid to get sick!</li><li>Terrible food, please DO NOT eat here! one of the worst places I 've ever eaten in my life, the place and

the worst places I 've ever eaten in my life, the place and the food had a horrible smell, I will never ever go to this nasty place again, I had to throw away all the food because I was afraid to get sick!</li><li>I had to find a new source of healthy food on campus ... so I checked out Berries &amp; Blooms.</li><li>I had always avoided B &amp; B in the past because the lineup always seemed too long and I did n't like the idea of paying for my food by weight.</li><li>I heard that they failed their food inspection once and that could easily be a rumour but based on what I have witnessed I would not be surprised.</li><li>We ordered food from two different catering companies for a campus event today.</li><li>The food is consistent and really fast.</li><li>Pho is the best comfort and hangover food.</li><li>Service is quick and food is always piping hot.</li><li>Good and cheap food, not the place to be if you 're looking for service or ambiance, but it 's your typical Vietnamese place.</li><li>The more homey, the better the food is.</li><li>It probably took 5 mins for the food to arrive, then again, we did n't order anything superfluous.</li><li>Overall, the restaurant is exactly what you would expect of a Vietnamese pho restaurant chain ( such as 88 or pho xe lua), quick to the point service and decent food!</li><li>The price is on point the food is on point, just make sure when you come here wear a bullet proof vest cause it 's near Jane and finch and sometimes there 's shady people walking around.</li><li>One of my favorite pho restaurants in the GTA, Pho Dau Bo is fast food without any of the drawbacks of typical fast food.</li><li>The food is typically good fare ... for the price.</li><li>Those new to the Vietnamese dining experience, keep in mind; ordering food is a completely self serve process.</li><li>You simply jot down the number of the item that you want on the slip and when the wait staff returns, return the menu and paper with your order and they 'll return with all of your food.</li><li>FAST service for pretty good food.</li><li>This applies to almost all restaurants, from fast food to fancier fare.</li><li>The consistency of the food and a bit of sentimentality keeps me coming back.</li><li>The food is always good and service is fast and friendly.</li><li>The service was fast and the food was tasty and not to forget the price was cheap.</li><li>After that I was just wondering if the food would suck or not, but overall it was n't bad.</li><li>The food has always been fast and fresh and absolutely delish.</li><li>The food, atmosphere, pricing are all amazing!</li><li>After having a baby I really had to cut down on unhealthy food and I chose pho to stick with it 's not to bad than other fast foods out there.</li><li>Their food is very tasty, consistent and well priced.</li><li>Food is always fresh and everyone working there speaks Vietnamese.</li><li>Yes Pho Dau Bo is a chain but this particular location is run and owned by a Vietnamese family and not Chinese owners which usually makes a significant difference in the authenticity and quality of food.</li><li>The food are awesome and delicious.</li><li>Better than grabbing a fast food chain meal Definitely a repeat place especially when craving something to warm the tummy at 10pm.</li><li>We continued but realized this food is trash.</li><li>The person who dished the food kissed his teeth and fanned me off TWICE.</li><li>Regardless, I appreciate their efforts to have my food cooked properly.</li><li>Like most Toronto Korean restos this place has horrendous food that is not worth paying for.</li><li>They do n't serve you the tea until the food comes.</li><li>Watching the food heating up from in front of you while munching on banchen, hot pot style.</li><li>Still did n't serve tea until all food came, waited almost 30mins for food when it 's not that busy, we ordered a beef bone noodle on the side but we found out there are same noodle comes with the gingsing chicken soup.</li><li>The food was mediocre at best.</li><li>Be prepared to experience a LOT of red chili in the food.</li><li>However, the food is very good, especially those cooked at the table.</li><li>However if you come here, expect to spend a long time here, because the cooking is really slow and it takes forever for the food to come.</li><li>Anyways the food here is good and if you have a lot of time to spare for dinner, then it is fine.</li><li>Not a potato was seen in my food.</li><li>1 hr to get food.</li><li>This is not your typical AYCE food.</li><li>The sashimi is really fresh and the food quality overall is very good.</li><li>The three things I liked about this AYCE restaurant is how friendly the staffs are, how quickly the food comes to our table, and the quality of the food is pretty good.</li><li>The three things I liked about this AYCE restaurant is how friendly the staffs are, how quickly the food comes to our table, and the quality of the food is pretty good.</li><li>For me it 's something about eating in booths that makes the food more enjoyable.</li><li>The food here is great too, I especially like how their sushi, rolls and hand rolls are not stuffed with excessive rice like most AYCE places!</li><li>Food comes promptly and I do n't feel they arbitrarily change your sashimi orders or `` lose'' your food orders.</li><li>The food itself was excellent and always beautifully presented, especially for an all-you-can-eat place and definitely the best value for the price that I 've ever seen ( $ 15/person for the lunch buffet on a holiday).</li><li>They also levy a charge on any uneaten food, which is completely reasonable given the quality of the items available on the lunch buffet menu.</li><li>The food quality is good for ayce, went to eat at sushi legend 5 times and never had a bad food quality experience yet.</li><li>Service was very good, and the food came very fast, staff were friendly and most of the orders arrived correctly.</li><li>Food: Food was overall very delicious and flavourful.</li><li>There is a wide variety of dishes to choose from and the quality of food was pretty good.</li><li>Pro:- Large variety of food to choose from.</li><li>The variety of food is good but very similar to other all you can eat.</li><li>Low quality food.</li><li>The food &amp; selection ( 4.5/5): Sashimi was fresh, the cooked meat was alright, but the rolls were definitely well done in terms of flavour and rice vs. Fish ratio: P A couple things of reasons why I thought this place differed from many other AYCE.</li><li>Again their cooked food was cooked, nothing too special but I got to try a lot of it! 3) they have a large selection of desserts.</li><li>Service ( 4.5/5): So their staff was n't particularly friendly or anything, but we got food FAST.</li><li>The food was really bad, the sashimi was doused in a citrus sauce that tasted like licking an orange peel.</li><li>The dinner menu is more expensive, but it also comes with more choice of food ( ie: salmon head, various other maki).</li><li>One of my go-to AYCE places as the food and variety is good.</li><li>The food is good and there are a lot of good points and must tries to this AYCE:- scallop sashimi ( it was quite delicious and fresh)- beef tataki ( although I was n't a fan of it)- gui ling gao ( in the dessert menu- not something I 've seen at other AYCE places)- takoyaki tastes really good ( the flavour is on point!)- grilled squid ( reminded me of night markets, it was very tasty, was n't too chewy at all)- grilled eggplant ( there 's a sweet sauce and it is grilled nicely)- chicken wing skewers ( they 're so good!, the wings are skewed on so the bones are pushed down)- pop is included in the menu ( so no extra charge for all you pop lovers!).</li><li>The somewhat poor service ( due mostly to a high customer-to-server ratio) is mostly overshadowed by the quality of the food.</li><li>Food was fresh and tasty with a very pleasant presentation.</li><li>The reason I 'm giving it 3 stars is because service was fast and quality of the food is higher then other AYCE.</li><li>Very good selections of food.</li><li>Able to.maintain the food quality, very attended staff, friendly, service in good standard, sashimi is always fresh, sushi rolls has the right portion of rice, weekends they serve scallop sashimi, spicy tuna hand roll, variety of good quality sashimi choices. reasonable priced and dessert is average.</li><li>The prices are reasonable and the food is flavourful.</li><li>The food are very good and besides sashimi, there are a lot selections for cooked foods.</li><li>Really mediocre food but at a decent price.</li><li>The variety of food is average with reasonably sized portions.</li><li>Friendly staff:) food comes quickly.</li><li>We came here for weekend lunch 14.99 Food: although no sashimi for lunch, they offered plenty.</li><li>Now, that food is n't always the best quality, but you make up for it by stuffing your face.</li><li>With more variety than most other places, they definitely have a lot of good quality food that you can eat as much as you want!</li><li>A lot of the food was very good and they had lots of things that many other AYCE restaurants do n't offer.</li><li>They staff mostly just shepherded food and plates to and from the kitchen.</li><li>The staff is nice, the food arrives quickly and the price is reasonable.</li><li>The food arrived promptly in random order.</li><li>The price they charge is a little higher than your regular sushi ayce. however the food is average. it is not amazing, it is not terrible, it is average.</li><li>A lil pricey but all their food are made to order freshly.</li><li>The food is good, sushi is great and the service was even better.</li><li>When we sat they brought our food relatively quickly, and always refilling our drinks and clearing our plates as soon as we were done.</li><li>Now on to the food ....</li><li>All of the food was declicious !!!</li><li>I like it. lunch price is pricey. but I like the food, good variety, good quality.</li><li>The food here is good considering it 's AYCE.</li><li>Decent food, sushi was whatever but I enjoyed the warm dishes.</li><li>Do n't get me wrong, the food is alright, ( only if u can actually get it on your table,) but I would n't call it best in this neighbourhood, if u want better then go to warden n steeles they have ayce called Yokohama, way better.</li><li>Once we placed our order, the food started coming within 5 minutes.</li><li>Too bad the food sucks.</li><li>Food was largely unremarkable, except for the beef sashimi which was amazing ( I do n't even eat beef but I made a 10 gram exception) and some of the sauces that were used with the grilled dishes.</li><li>There were n't any kinds of food that was outstanding or ' AMAZINGLY GOOD.'</li><li>The price was n't bad for the amount of food you get during lunch.</li><li>Food Quality: 7 Service: 8 Again .. all the sushi and and maki rolls were all pretty standard.</li><li>Overall experience, the food came out pretty quickly and servers were nice.</li><li>Sad, but true! 3.5 stars for the food! there 's a lot of choices and some of them are reaalllyy great but I 'm a huge fan of sashimi and it 's not amazing here: p but! + another 0.5 for their bigger dessert selection ANDD their free soft drinks!</li><li>Overall the food was alright and I understand that most AYCE kitchens probably are not too clean but I do n't think I will be coming back.</li><li>Why ? 1, Quality- The food here is fresh, colorful and tasty.</li><li>The food almost tastes the same every time I go.</li><li>And even on the busiest days they still manage to serve your food in a reasonable amount of time.</li><li>Service is great, food comes out fast and never been told last call.</li><li>I 'd come back again for the amazing price and food.</li><li>There are several kitchen items that I like, however, my main food focus is on the special rolls and the sashimi.</li><li>Awesome food, lots of options for the buffet and reasonably priced.</li><li>I thought the food was overall flavourful, appetizing, and had great variety.</li><li>Good food, fast service, nice portions ...</li><li>Anyways i had a great experience and i will be coming back another time. food is great servers are not. although our dishes were constantly brought out and picked up promptly the servers would throw dishes on to the table and even the bill as if they are giving food to dogs ... the food was delicious but too bad the waitresses had to ruin the experience.</li><li>Anyways i had a great experience and i will be coming back another time. food is great servers are not.

had to ruin the experience.</li><li>The food is consider good also.</li><li>The food quality is out of this world.</li><li>Although the food delivery to the table may take its time, it 's because it 's made to order.</li><li>And anyways, the food comes out at shots and not one plate at a time.</li><li>4 stars definitely well deserved. loved this place the last time I went =) Decor 's nice, food 's nice, they did forget some dishes, but it was okay =) Overall really nice service!</li><li>Food was fresh except miso soup was watered down and edamame was lacking salt and dry.</li><li>Food is very good but the service was spotty.</li><li>Although not super busy it took forever to get our food meanwhile every other table that came after us got their orders.</li><li>All they offer is first rate food.</li><li>The food comes out reasonably fast and the food is good too.</li><li>The food comes out reasonably fast and the food is good too.</li><li>Now the stand out food items- spicy salmon sushi, volcano roll, enoki beef roll, beef negi maki, spicy seafood udon soup.</li><li>The food came rather quickly.</li><li>I really like the fact the portions are not to big, so you get to try a little bit of everything without wasting so much food.</li><li>Love the seating, it is mostly booths, so you have more room for more food!</li><li>The food was alright.</li><li>I like the variety of food options, since my friend is not a sushi fan.</li><li>They throw the food on the table and worst of all they brought my friend hot water with a straw when he asked for water.</li><li>Overall, was pleased with the quality of the food.</li><li>Food Delivery of food is super fast ( 5 stars) Presentation of food ( 4 stars) Taste of food ( 3 stars, just average) Accuracy of food order ( 2 stars, Because of the speed of their service, couple times they got my order wrong in terms of the quantity of food, the choice of food) Service ( 3 stars, quick and response fast but not very personal)- They serve the food too fast, you wonder how they did it. =)- They clean up plates on your table very fast as well, they are constantly looking for plate to take away.</li><li>For a restaurant that serves uncooked food I found my experience completely unacceptable.</li><li>The food here was only okay.</li><li>It was n't too busy and the food taste good.</li><li>But overall the food is good.</li><li>The food quality is good for a buffet but they did forget our orders twice so there were periods where the table was bare and we were just waiting for more food to arrive.</li><li>The food quality is good for a buffet but they did forget our orders twice so there were periods where the table was bare and we were just waiting for more food to arrive.</li><li>Food is mediocre, service is lacking, long waiting list, most importantly ... they 're not very sanitary as they rush to clean things.</li><li>I find food on the seats and tables are n't properly cleaned.</li><li>Once we put our order through, the food came out in less than 10 minutes!</li><li>They were pretty good at seating people, but once seated it took quite a while to get our food.</li><li>The food was really disappointing.</li><li>The presentation was horrible too, they basically just put the food on the plate and just serve that to you.</li><li>I usually like to take lots of pictures when I go out to eat and this time I put my camera phone down because the food was just underwhelming.</li><li>In conclusion, this place is overpriced, food with terrible ingredients, and bland presentation.</li><li>I have to say, the speed of service, the accuracy of food order and the quality of food is amazing. even the servers are all pretty nice as well. empty dishes/plates do n't last very long on table. as soon as i finish swallowing the food, it does not take more than 45 seconds and the empty plates are gone! 2 minor issues with Sushi Legend.</li><li>Food was good but service was slow.</li><li>We ordered a total of 3 time, and every time without fail, at least half of the food did n't come.</li><li>Other than that, the food was so so.</li><li>The portion sizes were small and the food was just okay.</li><li>The food was good quality and came in good time and accurately.</li><li>I 've been to this place many times even though it 's expensive because I know the food is worth it.</li><li>Then out of the corner of my eyes I saw some Korean words, and Sinchon Food is tucked in at a corner inside the strip Mall.</li><li>Ended up Sinchon Food has one speciality ... everyone order the same thing, especially when the weather is chilly ...</li><li>Sinchon Food is really a Korean franchise with world wide location!</li><li>Great fresh food here for the lunch menu.</li><li>Other food was just average.</li><li>Even after we called the server and reminded her that we 're still waiting for our food several ( !!!) times, it was n't getting any better!</li><li>She introduced me a while back and I thought the food was fairly well done.</li><li>The owners are from Guyana but the food is similar to trini style also.</li><li>Service is n't amazing and food can take a while.</li><li>The food quality and selection is on par with other restaurants of this type in the area.</li><li>But I wanted to make sure I came back to write one because the food was pretty damn good.</li><li>The food was okay--what you 'd expect from Burger King.</li><li>Mercifully for those who liked to enjoy their fast food in peace, Burger King finally revealed on Superbowl night Herb to be this geeky looking fellow in a too-tight, loud suit.</li><li>Lost on the vast majority of fast food consumers was the message that Herb had never actually tried a Whopper, hence he was a geek, hence you were a geek too if you 've not actually bit into one of Burger King 's moist, juicy flame-broiled patties.</li><li>Great service, great food!</li><li>Price is reasonable, food is good, ca n't go wrong:).</li><li>It is so intimate and friendly. the food is authentic, superb and well priced.</li><li>Sampaguita is a sitdown meal with wait staff serving full dishes of made on order food ( think Chinese restaurant).</li><li>The best part about this place is the food.</li><li>Excellent food.</li><li>Food is very tasty, but as with all normal Filipino food, it is oily!</li><li>I am a pinoy and I am giving them a thumbs up for most of their food.</li><li>Once we sat down and ordered our food, the first dish came out super quick within minutes!</li><li>Overall, service and food were quick, staff were attentive and all of our needs were met regardless of how busy it was.</li><li>The orders moved slowly, but we finally got out food and then a few minutes later our drinks.</li><li>Pro Tip: While in line waiting for a table, take a look at the menu, give your order to the wait staff and your food will be ready for you as soon as your table is ready.</li><li>A few pieces of pork belly were slightly burnt and too crispy, but otherwise the food was of great quality.</li><li>The food looks as good as their menu.</li><li>3 for the food.</li><li>You can see your food being whipped up in the open concept kitchen, smoke and all!</li><li>You must go here over all the other Filipino restaurants I know of:) May look like a hole in the wall, but when push comes to shove, the food is what you 're here for.</li><li>Great place for authentic filipino food!</li><li>I 've eaten here a few times already and I really like the food.</li><li>The only food that does n't taste right is the sinigang na baboy.</li><li>Food was pretty bad, and it had a lot of oil.</li><li>Good food, good service.</li><li>This place is your typical fast food shawarma joint with some tables and seating available.</li><li>So onto the food prepping.</li><li>The food preppers put the hot fries in the same box with the salad.</li><li>I have eaten there a coupe of time and the food at first sight isnt bad until you notice all the bugs in it.</li><li>This is my favourite Vietnamese restaurant in T. O. The food is always good and the service is friendly.</li><li>FOOD The food was nothing special.</li><li>Same typical vietnamese food.</li><li>SERVER The food took longer to get to us than at other pho places I 've been to.</li><li>Great local spot with great food!</li><li>Service was quick and food came quick ( obviously).</li><li>The portion sizes at this location are large, and the quality of the food is excellent!</li><li>It was recommended by a friend, who is a food guru.</li><li>We ordered three dishes between the two of us, probably too much food.</li><li>No frills service and minimalist ambience but tasty food nonetheless!</li><li>Food is alright- not the best but still good.</li><li>Nice customer service on the food and good time for food delivery.</li><li>Food was very good, nice comfort fast food Chinese.</li><li>Just execute patience, you 'll get your food and a full belly to boot.</li><li>Sandwiches are such comfort food and nothing beats having a sandwich on freshly baked bread, especially bread that has such great texture and flavour.</li><li>I have found a wider range of their bread products than I find in my local food specialty shops at just a slightly lower price.</li><li>The food is simple but it 's all about the star of the plate, the meat! ( The seafood is fresh and delicious too) I ca n't really recommend anything specific as I 've tried pretty much everything on the menu and nothing has disappointed me.</li><li>The food on the other hand was quite lovely.</li><li>I was n't expecting much due to the dated decor, but was blown away by the food.</li><li>This is a place that obviously cares about good-quality food ...</li><li>This is one of my top five restaurants in Toronto, lots of reasons why but foremost, I love Star Trek the original series and I love good food.</li><li>My wife does n't like it because its too empty, but I do a lot of business lunches here because its not too busy and the food is awesome.</li><li>Food was just right, delicious and fast service ..</li><li>The food at Small Rooms is comparable to The Octagon Restaurant and David Duncan House.</li><li>We love to come here, the food is great steaks and sea food plater are Yuuuummmmmyyyyyyy Yes the decor is somewhat dated, yet the food as mentioned is superb.</li><li>Do n't remember the Food, except it was SPICY.</li><li>The food more importantly is YOM!</li><li>BTW why all our food look ORANGE in colour ????</li><li>Before they brought on the food, they gave several house complimentary dish such as salmon skin rolls, miso soups, salad, small cold noodle dish, deep fried oyster cakes and two kimchi dish.</li><li>Food is okay.</li><li>The food is just ok.</li><li>It 's not a bad one, but no Korean I know craves this joint, nor even goes back after they 've been introduced to it FOR FOOD.</li><li>My friend ordered it and I could n't resist stealing some of her food.</li><li>Nice decor and reasonable food.</li><li>The food and inevitable `` fixins'' ( kimchi and other side dishes) were tasty.</li><li>The food is the same as any other Tim Hortons, except, I have had a stale donut once here.</li><li>Great food, great service, happy tummy.</li><li>I went here couple times to try out the food and bubble tea.</li><li>The food was not so good.</li><li>The food is AMAZING !!!</li><li>The portions are huge and food does n't taste like its the same sauce with different meat.</li><li>A little tip: if you come on Sundays during lunch time, they have lunch specials where you can choose 1 out of 25 items from their regular menu PLUS a green or black tea ( cold/hot) for $ 5.99- $ 6.99, depending on the food.</li><li>I 've been here numerous times and have tried the bubble tea and food.</li><li>Some prices of the food has been increased but my favorite is the Braised Beef Noodles.</li><li>It 's a bubble tea place with lots of food options.</li><li>Their slushies and taro milk tea are n't the best ( depends which employee makes it to be honest) Gonna have to try out their food from all these reviews!</li><li>Scrumptious food, nice manager, cute children, free wifi, food comes with drinks during lunch, lots of outlets to charge tablets and phones, very considerate restaurant!</li><li>I never had the food, so I ca n't really comment on that.</li><li>I have been here a couple of times now and have n't been disappointed in the food.</li><li>The place does n't look that appealing from the outside due to its location but it 's Toronto, so the food is what matters.</li><li>Great price, great food and friendly atmosphere.</li><li>Will definitely come back next time I 'm in this area for more tasty food.</li><li>Such a find, as the food is awesome, prepared properly, with TLC, and the service is great.</li><li>The food is why I go!</li><li>Ca n't beat that deal for that much food.</li><li>Friendly staff and fresh food due to it being very popular.</li><li>No, not the owners, but the food.</li><li>One large order is enough for two people because they give you so much food.</li><li>They renovated recently so the place is a bit larger in the front but the food is still the same as before.</li><li>The food is well prepared.</li><li>So food is quite good.</li><li>The rest of the food was pretty good- but I feel like the stand out dish was their pasta of the day.</li><li>It was just that right combination of creamy, salty, savory flavors that just help you warm up for the rest of the food to come.</li><li>While the portions were n't huge- it was just enough food to fill you up without putting you into a coma.</li><li>The main problem with this place is that the food is perfectly good, but just not interesting or exceptional enough to justify what would have been the price range without the Groupon.</li><li>I am giving a three because of the food.</li><li>Their food are OK but they were not great.</li><li>Hopefully food would be better next time.</li><li>The food is lip smacking good.</li><li>The food always remains exceptional and fresh.</li><li>The food is decent too, we have the sweet and spicy chicken, seafood pancake, spicy seafood with rice cake.</li><li>While the food was forgettable, the booze; both in its cheapness and lovely flavor; will be remembered.</li><li>The food was good but nothing that would make me want to trek there again because I had to have the ( insert chicken dish here).</li><li>I 've been there many times n i think what makes a mcd standout is their service and cleanliness because all mcd serve the same food!</li><li>Food is okay its average.</li><li>Ca n't say much about the rest of the food.</li><li>The place was absolutely TRASHED- like food garbage on every single table there.</li><li>When we went to order food they told us they were switching over to the breakfast menu, so I ordered an item of the breakfast menu, and they told me they only had coffee and fries, but I could wait for half an hour.</li><li>No parking though as it 's on the busy intersection of Sheppard and Yonge. i got a big breakfast this morning to go only to realize that the guy did n't give me a hash brown when i got home. that 's like me getting a big mac combo and u forgot my fries .... dafuq ???? we order a take out from this restaurant and I would say the food was packed very good to avoid any leakage and to keep it warm.</li><li>The food was hot and tasty.</li><li>I 've been eating here for 10 years, and this is a really good spot in an otherwise bleak strip mall, the only place to get decent food at Crossroads.</li><li>I would make the argument that the food on the hot table is inedible and borderline unsafe for human consumption.</li><li>Consistently the best Italian food I 've had in Toronto!</li><li>The food is great! you can get schnitzel with dumplings, goulash, cheese noodles, strudel and palacinta ( a crepe with walnuts or jam inside).</li><li>It 's a bit if a hole in the wall but the food and prices are unbeatable!</li><li>The interior design and waitress were very nice, but the food was very veryyyyy bland and mediocre!</li><li>I find that that sometimes the temperature of my food is inconsistent- most of the time it 's perfect, but on some visits it 's just kind of warm instead of hot, which for fried food is disappointing.</li><li>The food was very tasty and plentiful.</li><li>Massive amounts of food for a decent price, but you have to like Hungarian food.</li><li>The food was so overpriced and the food did not tasted at all as ' authentic' as I hoped it to be.</li><li>The food was so overpriced and the food did not tasted at all as ' authentic' as I hoped it to be.</li><li>The food

... mmm ... !!</li><li>The food- was even more wonderful than I remember ( I thought it was the best back then too!)</li><li>Good comfort food.</li><li>The food was very good, very flavourful and the service was fast and friendly.</li><li>The waiter was very prompt and gave us good tips on choosing food and drinks.</li><li>The food was delicious!</li><li>It took a while for our drinks to come out when we first sat down, our food took a while and our desserts took a while too.</li><li>The service was bad and the food was worse.</li><li>They forgot to bring our appetizers and only when we reminded the server did the food come.</li><li>The food tasted stale and rubbery.</li><li>The food however was a disappointment.</li><li>The food was good, the service was good, but not great ambience though.</li><li>The decor is n't anything special, but the food was great!</li><li>The food has been extra delicious, and the portions seem to have increased significantly.</li><li>Bottom line is: the food is delicious, I 'd go back again, service is great, but the overall design and environment could be improved.</li><li>Absolutely horrible food!</li><li>There is something lacking in the food- whether it is passion or skills I just cannot say that La Mexicana is a place that I would like to come back to.</li><li>Too bad the food is n't the greatest.</li><li>Which is always a good sign.:) The decor is hole in the wallish but I had hopes for the food.</li><li>I 'm by no means an expert in Mexican cuisine- but I 've eaten my share of it in California, Mexico and in the city, I thought the food was okay.</li><li>Found the food a tad bit salty, the chips did n't taste that fresh, portion sizes are large yes, but I 'd rather pay less and get less food because I did n't require that much food.</li><li>Found the food a tad bit salty, the chips did n't taste that fresh, portion sizes are large yes, but I 'd rather pay less and get less food because I did n't require that much

good.</li><li>For food we got the bean soup, Fish tacos, and enchiladas.</li><li>Good food but very slow service. it sometimes take more than an hour to prepare the food.</li><li>Good food but very slow service. it sometimes take more than an hour to prepare the food.</li><li>1) The food is very reasonably priced.</li><li>5) For being so busy, they were very quick in turning over tables and bringing food promptly.</li><li>Our go to place for Chinese Mcdonald type of food.</li><li>In a nutshell: decent food, fast service, a little expensive compared to similar restaurants uptown From an Asian standpoint, this is your typical chinese diner joint; your mindset is to get some comfort food, have it fast and have it hot.</li><li>Our orders:- Singapore stir fry turnip cake This is a twist to the traditional version which you usually get during dim sum or street food.</li><li>A good Amoy vermicelli should be 1) well distributed sweetness 2) savory ingredients 3) I like my vermicelli not too dry aka have some sauce to coat the noodles 4) piping hot IMO:- food was hot.</li><li>Their food is always consistent.</li><li>As well I find depending on what time of the day you go the food is prepared differently.</li><li>I have cut down on my msg intake lately but I can simply not resist congee stars delicious food!</li><li>The food here is mediocre at best.</li><li>By the time they brought the garlic shoots we had finished all the other food.</li><li>The food was fine, nothing revolutionary.</li><li>It 's too bad, if only the food was better.</li><li>The staff had proper manners, good timing, and our food were served quite fast yet everything was cooked well!</li><li>The food is cheap, the service is quick ( once you 're seated), and best of all, it tastes great!</li><li>Love this place, food is fantastic and service is fast.</li><li>Who cares about friendly lol we just wanna eat good food.</li><li>If you are looking for a place that sells good food for cheap, this is the place to go.</li><li>On some days the food is really tasty and on others it is n't as tasty.</li><li>Not only is the food delicious but the service is top notch for an asian restaurant.</li><li>Service was excellent and friendly but sadly the food was not up to par.</li><li>The restaurant is nice ( and not dirty), the service is fast, they open late, the food is great and the price is right.</li><li>No complaints but was n't fantastic either. i come here far too often ... to be honest im getting sick of it a little. but the food is not bad .. this is the closest you will get to cantonese cuisine downtown ( excluding spadina) ... congee queen is more north so its really the best you got if you live within this area ... fried turnip cake is good ... congee not bad. expect left overs when you come here as the serving size is generous.</li><li>The food is great as well! one order, food is not fresh ( chicken &amp; duck). second order, black bean souce pork is chewey &amp; bit raw.</li><li>The food is great as well! one order, food is not fresh ( chicken &amp; duck). second order, black bean souce pork is chewey &amp; bit raw.</li><li>Pros: Amazing food, fast service, clean, and very cheap Cons: Can be pretty busy at lunch ... but I guess that 's an indicator that people really love this restaurant Recommendations: Congee- all of them are amazing General Tao Chicken- I 'm Filipino/Canadian and you know we love GT chicken!</li><li>Fast service, good food and cheap prices- the perfect trifecta.</li><li>I understand the food is cheap, but it really is no different or better than Congee Queen, Congee Wong, or any other congee place.</li><li>I was elated to discover that Congee Star had better food AND better service.</li><li>We would always do take out, and take home big full take out containers full of their food.</li><li>The food is good, but not worth the teeny portion size they give you. ... while i 've always known this place existed, it 's hard for me to remember that it 's there to try it out. located in a plaza on don mills but you ca n't really see the storefront and if you 're not looking for it you 'll drive by it completely. finally we got dinner takeout as we were searching on yelp. we ordered: live whole lobster with efu noodles- excellent. yeung chow fried rice- good, but the peas were slightly undercooked. sweet cruller rice noodle rolls, good. stir fried beef with vegetables, good. deep fried squid tentacles, good. fried turnip patties Singapore style, mediocre. sweet and sour pork, excellent. the food was great, the prices are definitely cheaper than congee queen. all of that for $ 70, and they deliver for orders over $ 25- which i did n't know until we picked up the food. love delivery, especially for the winter- will definitely return!</li><li>The food is good, but not worth the teeny portion size they give you. ... while i 've always known this place existed, it 's hard for me to remember

good.</li><li>They offer great food too.</li><li>Food wa n't bad but the service was subpar at best, they ignored us after we received our food, bad service out weighs the ok food.</li><li>Food wa n't

good.</li><li>For some reason, the staff who bring the food never seemed to know where the meals would go.</li><li>They would go to the table closer to the door, and when they said no, then our food would find its way to us.</li><li>When I ordered food, it was o.k., but nothing special.</li><li>The food was good.</li><li>It 's never too busy, it has a diverse crowd ( from university students to middle aged folk), and the food is great.</li><li>It 's bus accessible, close to the village at York, and I 've never been disappointed with the service, food, or drinks.</li><li>It 's a pub with mediocre food and a bunch of booze.</li><li>Not sure if my IQ just dropped through the floor but between that verbal exchange, ugh food, and ALcool!</li><li>They service was great the whole night and food was amazing.</li><li>Dont forget to bring your id, besides that the food is good and the staff is a welcoming group.</li><li>Great food, service and vibes !!</li><li>I 'd definitely recommend coming to this location to watch sports games and enjoy good food!</li><li>Great tasting food for very low prices.</li><li>For food and cleanness ..</li><li>The food came in huge portion size and I was n't able to finish my food.</li><li>The food came in huge portion size and I was n't able to finish my food.</li><li>The food was light on your stomach and tasted superb !!</li><li>The food is

tasty.</li><li>Amazing food, huge dishes.</li><li>This place always provides great food and very quick service.</li><li>One of the owners named Eddie served my business partner and i and the food blew us both away.</li><li>I 've been eating here for close to 10 years so i know what i 'm talking about in regards to the food and experience ... i moved away from the area and have n't been here for a while and last night i took my family for what was sure to be a great treat.</li><li>When i arrived on a Friday night i did n't see the usual long line, as i was expecting to wait in line as usual for a table ... it was 3/4 empty ... i did n't sense the usual smell in the air of that great food being cooked from the kitchen ... i did n't recognize any of the staff at all ...</li><li>Due to this i told my family that i was worried that the food experience was n't going to be good ... since i did n't see the usual packed place with customers waiting in line ... instead i saw a 3/4 empty restaurant and this told me something terrible had happened and that 's why there was no crowd.</li><li>The servers did n't know the menu enough to answer questions as to the differences of the dishes and when the food arrived i was floored.</li><li>I also miss Eddie and his smile and passion for his food and service ... i only hope he opened another restaurant and if so i pray i can find it Eddie you were the best and my Family and i thank you for giving us 10 years of amazing food and the joy of eating at your special restaurant what an experience, we will never forget you.</li><li>I also

want to seem rude and say he thought the food was spoiled, so he said that `` it was not what I expected to get when I ordered it'' and again asked if he could perhaps get something else.</li><li>I followed him up to the register, and throughout the entire transaction, had to listen to him justify the fact that he was upset because now he had to throw the food out.</li><li>Good servers, standard food ( stay away from the pad thai though), but TERRIBLE management.</li><li>Restaurant: Joons Cuisine: Korean Location: North York Address: 4852 Yonge St Price Range: $ 10 ~ 15 1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent Food: 4 Service: 3 Ambiance: 3 Overall: 3.5 Extra information:* Many items for 2 people minimum* 2 locations ( North York &amp; Christie)* Vegetarian option Avail I love table-top cooked dishes, they are the best because you share same thing with everyone ... which means no crying over who ordered a better dish.</li><li>Overall I enjoyed the food here and the service is decent.</li><li>Overall, this is a cute cozy little restaurant with decent tasting food to eat at on a cold winter night!</li><li>Food is great!</li><li>Do n't even know if we could go on our road trip today just because of this meal. visited on tuesday night around 7pm for dinner. the place was packed and noisy. there were only 2 servers + owner lady ? so the service was very slow ( especially they have to cook the food for u at the table). they were so busy and my order was confused but she apologized politely right away so we just ate our meal w/out complain. but i still prefer the downtown location. their food &amp; service is better. and its really hot in the inner part of the restaurant.</li><li>Mediocre food, portions were smaller than usually, u have to add cheese, ramen and rice cake, do n't bother getting the rice add ones We waited 30mins for our food to come and they would n't give us our side dishes until our meal came ......</li><li>Mediocre food, portions were

are warm and friendly and the food is delicious!</li><li>I would even go as fas as comparing it to the great food i had in Italy last year.</li><li>Great food, nice atmosphere, excellent service and amazing take-out to boot.</li><li>The food is outstanding.</li><li>This is s nice place with good solid food.</li><li>Good things: food is mostly excellent.</li><li>Food is good but not fabulous for the price per entree.</li><li>Food was decent, coffee was terrible but overall good value for the money.</li><li>Price is pretty decent but food is average.</li><li>First a little background- Hong Kong being the cosmopolitan metropolis it is, is full of restos such as these that serve up a Cantonese version of Western food ( spaghetti, steak n potatoes, borscht, lots and lots of toast sandwiches).</li><li>Food is alright.</li><li>I used to go to the old location a lot in the early 2000s and remembered quite enjoying their food.</li><li>However, when I was served my steak combo, there appeared to be a noticeable dip in quality of food.</li><li>Serves typical true hk diner food.</li><li>They have a TV that usually broadcast TVB dramas and I guess watching it kills time as we wait for the food to be served.</li><li>Great little hi style Cafe tucked in the corner of the food basics plaza.</li><li>The food for the most part is on par.</li><li>It 's worth a shot if you 're feeling like HK food but do n't want to travel to far from North York.</li><li>The food was really good as well!</li><li>Food is so so.</li><li>The food were served fast.</li><li>However they have been around for ages and still have a decent customer base, which I attribute to their food quality and consistency.</li><li>The service is friendly and the food is fantastic.</li><li>They should renovate BUT the food is GREAT best Chinese food I had in the city hands down.</li><li>The restaurant is family owned which is why the food must be so good, you can taste their passion in the food ...</li><li>The restaurant is family owned which is why the food must be so good, you can taste their passion in the food ...</li><li>Food was ok but pad Thai was too too sweet.</li><li>Oh well, I 'm here for the food.</li><li>Well that does n't happen with the food here, maybe it was the fried banana desert that did it.</li><li>Though this place is not ideal to be a real big foodie critic, it 's always been a go to place for a quick bite, and a decent amount of food.</li><li>Service was fast and the food was good, although I would have liked more fresh veg in my curry.</li><li>I found the service, food and atmosphere to be great and while the location is pretty small and cramped, it 's not busy enough to really bother me.</li><li>Great place, great service and great food.</li><li>Although this particular location is a bit small and cramped, the great food and atmosphere make up for the lack of space.</li><li>The food is, however, consistent.</li><li>Food is the same as any other St. Louis location, it 's a chain.</li><li>Very quick service and the food is always delicious.</li><li>The food is very good.</li><li>I do n't eat there for the service, I go there for the food.</li><li>Food is very good though and service is acceptable for a viet joint.</li><li>Delicious food and quick service for a very reasonable price.</li><li>I had some of the chicken skewers with rice and the food was horrible.</li><li>They charge a lot for your food too expensive for not so good food.</li><li>They charge a lot for your food too expensive for not so good food.</li><li>Really tasty food and friendly service.</li><li>I love to have my shawarma their specially the chicken one very tender and juicy, best libanese food I ever eat.</li><li>The only thing worse than the people working at this store is the horrible food and portions they serve.</li><li>Pathetic customer service, un-eatable food, and expensive prices are what you get.</li><li>The worst food I 've had at Yorkdale.</li><li>That is what a foodie like me calls heaven when people just come around and offer you free amazing food constantly:) But I was n't there for the chicken, oh no no no. I saw the beef shawarma, or shall I say, smelled it from a mile away:) It is a rare luxury to see a fresh .. succulent ( i feel dirty lol) ... beef shawarma grilling ... glistening on that hot turning stand lol yeah this is starting to sound a little raunchy, i know!</li><li>I do n't even care what the food tastes like after service like that.</li><li>It 's only good with the hummus, garlic and hot sauce, so always ask for more sauce just for the food to taste marinated and seasoned well.</li><li>Really tasty food have no complaints.</li><li>I ca n't believe you serve that kind of food to your customers !!!</li><li>I decided to go to Yorkdale today just for the Lebanese food because I did remember their friendly staff and fresh food in the past.</li><li>I personally thought the way the salads were presented was beautiful. really fresh fish for its low price. this sushi resaurant is actually one of the oldest in north york area since 1999 ( ? im pretty sure) when u enter, sushi bar greets u with irashaimasen and ur immediately seated by a waitress or waiter. hot green tea is usually given as soon as you seat down and after you order, some free edamame and tofu comes out. then u get the food u ordered ( fast) and ur tea is never emptied bc of the constant refill and quality checks. the place is old but i looks neat.</li><li>I went to pickup the food few month ago so called the store.</li><li>Did he also do something to my food perhaps ??</li><li>For the record, the food was n't that great anyways.</li><li>I 've read several reviews about people complaining about long waits for their food but if you order sushi and it arrives to your table quickly, I 'd be concerned.</li><li>The prices are fairly reasonable but it 's the service, portion size, and delicious food that keep me coming back.</li><li>Admittedly I didnt come here for the food but for the company so I did n't really know what I was eating.</li><li>The restaurant quality has really gotten worse over time, food and fish quality, store bought products vs made in the restaurant.</li><li>The food quality is pretty consistent but specials are sometimes hit or miss. The favorite choices is a chirashi salmon, which is always a good portion and fairly priced.</li><li>The service is OK when the restaurant is slow, but when busy takes quite awhile to get a server to come to the table and for food to arrive.</li><li>Not sure if they had an off day but when we went on Canada Day the food we received could only be described as amateurish in direct contrast to the well presented interior of this roomy restaurant.</li><li>Awesome service .... friendly, fast &amp; very accommodating ..... food substitutes is welcome !!</li><li>This restaurant is like someone going through the motions without any care- both the food and the service.</li><li>Food is consistently good; my only slight complaint would be that the edamame is served cold and plain ( I prefer hot, with sea salt).</li><li>Otherwise, really great food and fresh fish.</li><li>The food was alright for the price paid.</li><li>The food took a lot of time to prepare in my honest opinion.</li><li>Other food is mixed.</li><li>Friendly service, good food, decent prices.</li><li>Presentation and food quality is four stars.</li><li>And try getting anyone 's attention to ask them why only one person at our table got their food and the rest of us have to either sit and watch them eat while we 're still hungry, or the person who was served feels guilty to start and their grilled food goes cold.</li><li>The salmon tasted weird and that totally turned me off from all my food.</li><li>It 's so easy to opt for something better in North York, so do yourself a favour. food was ok, I know the sashimi is usually fresh and service is quite good usually.</li><li>This way, this eliminates the communication challenges; thus, allowing their staff to concentrate on the food preparation and not for all parties straining for what is said.</li><li>The plaza is swarmed with a lot of food options so it 's always crowded, parking is atrocious there and the chatime here is quite small in comparison to others- on par with the Mississauga location I think, or possibly smaller.</li><li>The food quality has been declining and it 's not what it used to be.</li><li>Parking kind of sucks and seating is essentially non-existent, so do n't come here for the ambience -- but come for the food!</li><li>Will definitely order from them again but I would n't order the ginger tofu again. the food is great and the workers are friendly.</li><li>He said that for dine in service each person must order at least $ 10 worth of food ( to be fair it does state this on the menu) but I pointed out politely that the the place was three quarters empty and it would be pretty unlikely that there 'd be a rush of customers clamouring for our coveted table in the last hour before closing.</li><li>Amazing food, do n't judge by the decor.</li><li>First time at Thai Bistro ... food was fantastic!</li><li>But considering how good the food was I 'd say it was all worth it.</li><li>He kept coming by to refill our glasses of water without us asking and seemed happy when we said we were really enjoying our food.</li><li>There was only once that the food order was n't spot on ( pineapple chicken curry was n't that at all and forgot a whole order of rice), but they 're humble, fast and will accommodate you every time.</li><li>Food was good.</li><li>Food is good but do n't expect too much on decor and customer service as they totally do n't apply on this Thai joint.</li><li>3 stars for the great food only, otherwise no stars at all.</li><li>Ignoring the price and decor the food I had which is the chicken cashew.</li><li>Overall the food was over a four star rating but the decor and price sort of dragged it down.</li><li>The food was AMAZING!</li><li>The food was very good and worth five stars, but everything else about the experience was just okay.</li><li>It seemed like there were only two people working in the restaurant, one person taking orders and working the cashier, and one person that was cooking all the food, which was done right behind the counters.</li><li>However, we were told that we ca n't order just the appetizer, because each table could only place one order, so we have to order all the food at the same time.</li><li>The food came pretty fast.</li><li>Definitely one of the better Thai food I 've had.</li><li>My friend who lives in the area said the guy working the front to take your order is the most unhelpful person, but the food is worth the lack of care in service.</li><li>But nonetheless the food was actually really tasty and it did fill us up, the pad Thai had just the right amount of sweetness to it and it is n't saucy.</li><li>This is a nice Thai place in the area .. and it 's authentic ( the people who work there are Thai), not the nicest restaurant I 've been to but sometimes you 're just coming for the food!</li><li>This is not a date place, unless you truly believe in the passion-arousing powers of delicious food.</li><li>If standing around in an empty line in an empty restaurant being unable to sit down because of borderline discriminatory seating practices was n't humiliating enough, just remembering how average the food tastes at this place from the several times I have been there was enough to deter me from leaving the restaurant- and NEVER coming back again.</li><li>This gets 4 stars for the food ONLY, i want ot make that clear.</li><li>The food is authentic, tasteful, though I think just slightly on the expensive side for what you get.</li><li>But I stress the food is GOOD! some people call this place totally ghetto in the decorations and atmosphere. its just your regular breakfast diner type setup with about 5 or 6 tables.</li><li>But food never disappoints!</li><li>After ordering my food, he told me in a agitated way I could not eat in.</li><li>Good food, authentic, good portion size and the guy behind the counter is always welcoming when we visit on business trips to the area.</li><li>All in all good value for your money and the food is delicious.</li><li>The food is amazing.</li><li>You will always get good service and good food.</li><li>Good delicious food here.</li><li>It is a rather small place but the food is good, their curry, padthai, basil beef are all really delicious.</li><li>Wanting to try something new, I headed out there with one of my coworkers who has been there a few times and vouched for the food.</li><li>Okay, so how was the food ?</li><li>Most importantly, the food is soooo tasty and flavourful.</li><li>Would highly recommend this place for all Thai food lovers.</li><li>The service is very efficient and I suppose some would see it as `` rude'', but all in all, fantastic food supersedes all the minus points.</li><li>Great location ( the food in general in this plaza is phenomenal), friendly service, and the drink quality is consistently delicious.</li><li>Anyway on with the food ...</li><li>Overall good representation of Thai food in the area, and will definitely come back to try something else too ..</li><li>I lived in Bangkok for 6 months and can say that the food here is almost comparable to what you would get in Thailand ( would be comparable if Thai Bistro was able to get the same fresh ingredients as you get in Thailand).</li><li>The food is fantastic!</li><li>But wow, the food is definitely a standout.</li><li>100% recommend the food here!</li><li>The food is amazing !!!</li><li>Delicious food, quick, friendly service; I have n't had any bad experiences with the staff as mentioned in other reviews.</li><li>But if it 's good food you care about, this is the spot.</li><li>Food is horrible and over priced like every other Indian restaurant.</li><li>The food is delicious and is home quality; however, there are not many options.</li><li>The food was n't really my style but it was still good and it 's a great place for sharing, not sure if I would recommend it for a first date but definitely a 3rd or 4th date, once you 've gotten to know each other.</li><li>The food, for the most part, is really tasty ( their Butter Chicken is fantastic) although I ca n't say that I 'm a big fan of their Tandoori Chicken ...</li><li>The food is not FRESH.</li><li>Nah, the food was not good at all.</li><li>A couple years back I guess due to the relative obscurity of the `` bun bo Hue'' dish, they renamed themselves adding the `` pho'' as that seemed to be the only food non-Vietnamese knew about Vietnamese cuisine Let 's get to the food: bun bo Hue is a vermicelli dish, with beef shank, pork, lemongrass and lots of other herbs.</li><li>A couple years back I guess due to the relative obscurity of the `` bun bo Hue'' dish, they

at.</li><li>Just purchased food from here for my two children, and our family, and as my daughter was half way through her food found a steel piece on her plate !!!!</li><li>Also, as we were coming out of the restaurant another customer was complaining about soap in her food !!!</li><li>Good food at good prices and great daily specials on food and drinks.</li><li>On the minus side, the food is that much worse.</li><li>The food came fast and tasted decently okay ..</li><li>The plates are big, came lot of food.</li><li>The food is always good and the beer is always cold..</li><li>The food is always fresh and tastes great.</li><li>I think a lot of Chinese food is bland and not very appetizing but @ this restaurant the food is flavorful and delicious.</li><li>The food is good.</li><li>The staff is really friendly and will answer all your questions in regards to the food.</li><li>My partner is Persian so i 've become an avid middle eastern food lover and this place has some of the best pertain food!</li><li>The food is really good, especially the kebabs, and prices are very reasonable.</li><li>They are from Iran but yesterday the man running the place wore a Canada ball-cap and seemed genuinely pleased to see our Canadian family coming in to enjoy their food.</li><li>The food selection is very limited there ( a few doughnuts, I think), so I would recommend grabbing a bite elsewhere.</li><li>I 've actually been brave enough to venture back and give them another chance, and at least I have n't experienced food poisoning again.</li><li>Great service, but their food is just average.</li><li>The food is as I anticipated, pretty good, especially the lasagna, worth going back there for that.</li><li>Cons- The food here is very mediocre; my sister and I ordered pizzas ( the Deluxe and Pepperoni) and realized that they were not the same from so many years ago.</li><li>The seating inside is plentiful, the atmosphere is nice, and our waiter was just lovely ( he was very friendly and his service stood out), but as I consider food to be the star of the show, I wo n't be hurrying back here any time soon, though I wo n't say I 'd never try it again.</li><li>Overall, Paisano 's was a good experience- ambient, cozy, great service, and, for the most part, good food- not amazing, but good enough.</li><li>Tucked into the small street if Willowdale ave, this place has a non pretentious atmosphere, the food is delicious and fair prices.</li><li>My parents live in the area &amp; we were looking for quality take out food that was available for delivery.</li><li>We found it, The food was delivered so fast &amp; it was hot .... and I mean HOT.</li><li>If you 're in the mood for good Italian food but do n't feel like going out, Paisano 's is the perfect choice.</li><li>Zero customer service skills, food was okey nothing special.</li><li>Our server was very attentive, and the food was delicious.</li><li>The waiter was quick with our drinks and food and was helpful with suggestions.</li><li>Now to the food.</li><li>While it may be a little hard to find parking on the weekends, this place has become one of my favourite Italian places due to inexpensive yet delicious food and decent service.</li><li>The food is always great !!</li><li>Good food, like the service in restaurant, but will never order pickup or delivery again.</li><li>I was there last night for dinner and one of the servers had long blonde hair and did not have it tied back, she was serving food to customers with one hand while flipping her long hair all over the place with the other hand, it was disgusting to watch and had she been serving food to my table I would have refused it.</li><li>The food was ok, not bad but also not great, just mediocre.</li><li>As for the food, my party usually orders the large caesar salad, deluxe pizza, and choice of pasta as an entree.</li><li>We will definitely order again EDIT: ordered again .... this place is so fast like 20 min from order to door. and food is scalding and I mean scalding hot which for us is amazing.</li><li>We ordered takeout as we could n't sit in due to time constraints, but we live in the area, so the food was still hot when we returned home.</li><li>Unfortunately, we were quite disappointed with the food.</li><li>When we got home to eat our food, my food was packed in a tray with three divisions, one for a few pieces of carrot and broccoli, one for linguine with tomato sauce, and in the middle was the breaded chicken.</li><li>Too bad the food is ALL bland.</li><li>But overall the food was a plenty, my guests bot had pasta and seem quite happy with it.</li><li>Overall the food came hot and was filling.</li><li>I keep coming back for the quality, quantity and reasonable price of the food.</li><li>We always order from Paisanos because the pizza is easily one of my favourites in Toronto but every time we order our food is always hot!</li><li>I can always expect hot and yummy food whenever I order from the restaurant!</li><li>Overall the service was very good and the food was decent would recommend to try it out.</li><li>Their food is consistently good ( we get their garlic shrimp every time) and prices are reasonable.</li><li>Nice casual restaurant with great italian food.</li><li>The food is cooked to perfection, always served fresh and hot.</li><li>The food is flavourful, of excellent quality, and worth every penny.</li><li>Are they serving real ' Italian' food ?</li><li>- Overall, the food was definitely good.</li><li>- My sister 's boyfriend being Italian himself makes better food IMHO.</li><li>You wo n't regret it. service decent food quite good décor-forget it is this an Italian restaurant with the worst non-Italian bread ( non crusty and non tasty ever in an Italian restaurant pizza above average.</li><li>As soon as I walked in the door, the aromas took me back to those earlier days; enjoying good food with great friends.</li><li>The decor is a bit dark and dingy but the food makes up for it.</li><li>I only wish the food was more consistently good.</li><li>( As a side note: I do n't understand how a reviewer can call their food ' mediocre' and still give them 4 stars.).</li><li>Food is your usual pub fare.</li><li>My bf and I ordered a pound of wings for appetizers, and then moved on to traditional pub food.</li><li>Food is hit and miss, from standard pub fare to really tasty bbq and wraps, there should be something to please everyone.</li><li>The service was quick and efficient and the food was super fresh.</li><li>Awesome food no matter what you order.</li><li>Willie Stouts seems to be a great place to hang out as they have a nice bar, decent food, a pool table, and plenty of TVs everywhere.</li><li>The fries were nothing special, but the food was faaaaabulous.</li><li>My burger had all of the major food groups: spice, cheese, veggies, bacon, and beef.</li><li>Good food and good company.</li><li>Service was horrible on this day, the lady who served us seemed to hate us, dropped off food and turned away so fast we could barely ask for stuff, ignored our bell, did n't bring us rice until 15 mins after we got our kamponggi, and took the menu away .. while my friend was reading it o_ O Could be because we were the only ones in there not speaking Korean ?</li><li>Food was homey and good ( not great) but table coatings were scraped off, outlet sockets were broken and bare, floors were stained black and brown ... as much as I tried to focus on their kind service and good food, the quality of their restaurant cleanliness kept coming into mind as it really just was so run down and dirty.</li><li>Food was homey and good ( not great) but table coatings were scraped off, outlet sockets were broken and bare,

down and dirty.</li><li>I have always came here for Korean food since I live across the street and the food was pretty decent.</li><li>I always come for table BBQ, great food, good service.</li><li>Awesome food and we had a nice waitress.</li><li>Service was quick and food was very good.</li><li>The food is top notch, especially for the price.</li><li>The food is very authentic from what I can tell.</li><li>TMI point: the food will give you mega gas for days.</li><li>First time here as I decided to try a different Korean restaurant and I was fairly impressed by how great the service and food was.</li><li>The waitress smiled and although it was fairly busy on a Friday evening, the food, service and overall quality was top notch.</li><li>The food is pretty good ( above average) and the price is reasonably.</li><li>But later because the food is to salty we order 1 more rice, then she laughed a bit and said `` I told you it is not enough''.</li><li>A bit off the main path but do n't be deceived- great food, good friendly service, will definitely be back.</li><li>This place is on point with their food, no complaints there!</li><li>The food is one of the best Korean food I have had, every thing was made perfect!</li><li>I 'm rarely impressed by the food at Korean restaurants.</li><li>I find their food to be on a more garlicky side, but to quote a Korean friend, if it 's not garlicky it 's not real Korean food.</li><li>Great food, large portions, at very reasonable prices.</li><li>What do you get when you combine good prices, good selection, and good food ?</li><li>Overall food was decent for the price.</li><li>Food was awesome.</li><li>First time at an authentic korean family restaurant and I was blown away by the food.</li><li>Great food, nice booth style seating, but limited space.</li><li>Why I give this place 4/5 is because the food did impress me.</li><li>This family owned restaurant serves delicious food, has efficient service and great prices.</li><li>Forget the food!</li><li>The waitress asked me if my food was okay when she saw that I had n't touched my food yet ( not with a look of annoyance but more with a look of genuine concern that only Korean ahjumas seem to be able to pull off ...).</li><li>That said, the service was great, the food was great, the place is clean.</li><li>The food is spiced perfectly- some dishes are hot, some mildly hot and some mild.</li><li>Meh food, but probably one of the nicest delivery guys I 've ever met.</li><li>We eat the vegetarian menu regularly and the food keeps us craving it for days.</li><li>Extremely good food and excellent service.</li><li>The place felt classy, food was not bad.</li><li>The food was so flavourfull, that a missing scallop did n't matter, so we did n't mention it.</li><li>Food was decent.</li><li>Clearly there is something wrong with the food ..</li><li>The food was incredible.</li><li>Amazing food.</li><li>I was busy telling another waiter that it was okay that the orders of which the food came did n't offend me.</li><li>The food certainly was not amazing, although I did have a enjoyable time.</li><li>I just do n't know whether the food was worth that price.</li><li>Not so good food comparing to price, pizza was soft and dough in the middle and staff are just not ready for the place.</li><li>To me This type of organizing and food is not acceptable for an Italian place.</li><li>The staff is friendly, the restaurant is nice, and the food is good too.</li><li>The price you pay for the food is amazing and they have something for everyone to enjoy on the menu.</li><li>The service was pretty quick between taking our drink orders, food orders and when the food came out- surprisingly so since it was so full.</li><li>The service was pretty quick between taking our drink orders, food orders and when the food came out- surprisingly so since it was so full.</li><li>Onwards to the food: The focaccia/bread was deelicious and completely went with our Penne Mezza Notte that we shared.</li><li>I often wonder if this entire strip of Yonge Street around North York City Centre is just bland, much like the food in the Entertainment District in Toronto is just mediocre.</li><li>Also, when sprinkling parmesan cheese on to our food, she sort of sprinkled it all over the table, the floor and into my lap.</li><li>This is a nice Italian restaurant, personally I do n't know why everyone else is giving bad reviews, I guess they just do n't know good food when they see it!</li><li>The food was horrible, the chicken was under cooked, too sour, it was not stuffed with anything and it came with bones! spinach was below the chicken and the cheese was melted on top of the chicken chew skin: (, half a spoon of mashed potato that did not taste good and couple of carrots scattered around the dish.</li><li>I do recommend the service but not the food!</li><li>Not going ever again! food was not good at alllllll.</li><li>As for the food, I 'd rather get a quarter size of their portions and more flavour.</li><li>The pasta was cooked very well, but it lacked what some would describe as passion and love for the food itself.</li><li>Food was dry clumpy and disgusting.</li><li>It is not a dive either- and the food is n't the ' comfort food' type where it is loaded with grease and whole-flavouredness (* ahem* Dantes* ahem*).</li><li>It is not a dive either- and the food is n't the ' comfort food' type where it is loaded with grease and whole-flavouredness (* ahem* Dantes* ahem*).</li><li>It reminded me of simple food in Italy.</li><li>The food is pretty bland though, regardless of the plentiful ingredients ( green/red peppers, mushrooms.zucchini, eggplant and chicken.)</li><li>Sometimes, even the restaurant is not that busy, they still ask you to sit in the small table for 2 and I found that there is not enough space for the food.</li><li>If the service is better, I will have a higher rating as the food is always good over there!</li><li>The interior is a little dim and old, but their food does not disappoint.</li><li>The food is OK and the atmosphere is OK mostly middle aged individuals.</li><li>The food is a different story.</li><li>We ordered for delivery and were n't too impressed with the food.</li><li>The food was excellent and the portions were good.</li><li>Overall horrible service but excellent food.</li><li>However experience and quality wise- SURE! give it a go for some authentic italian food! i dont really like italian food ( well, until recently til tappo and paganelli 's .. but anyways). i used to find pasta so boring, plain &amp; bland that i would always end up eating some bland pasta covered in permesean/black pepper. theres no exciting flavors, it just doesnt wake up my tastebuds.</li><li>The food is decent yes, but only decent.</li><li>Service good, food excellent, wholesome Italian style ...</li><li>The food is not bad, but the service is horrible.</li><li>Our waitress had an attitude did not once check on us or ask us how our food was, and when we asked for water, the person serving looked like he had better things to do.</li><li>They do not make traditional caribbean food and served the oxtail and rice and beans with cucumber instead of cabbage.</li><li>The food here is really good and cheap.</li><li>Looks worn down inside, but the food is great!</li><li>Overall, it 's a good restaurant for quick and cheap food.</li><li>I 've also noticed that it has something of an identity crisis with much of the food.</li><li>Some of my friends of complained about the portion sizes, but then I make the comparison to the Island food chain and they kind of suck it up as the prices are almost identical in respect to portion sizes of both.</li><li>But the quality of food is worth it!</li><li>I enjoyed their food a lot, they had good quality sushi at a reasonable price.</li><li>The food took a bit of time to arrive, and I personally do n't like it when I have to ask the waitresses/waiters for water when our cups have been empty for a while ( not because I 'm spoiled but I 'm shy lol).</li><li>The food is always consistent which is all I ask.</li><li>The food was devoured within a few minutes.</li><li>The food was amazing.</li><li>Each and every time we came by the food was delicious.</li><li>It 's worth the trip to Toronto for this food!</li><li>A lot of times we have guests over, we come here to buy the food, we can feed a whole army of people on the cheap.</li><li>The food is about the same price as Altona Kebab next door which I 'd reccomend over Arzon.</li><li>Where this supermarket lacks in ambiance, it makes up for in its variety of Persian breads, and food counter.</li><li>It gets zero stars for its food.</li><li>The taste of the food was truly distasteful.</li><li>When a restaurant has a small menu like this restaurant, one expects awesome food.</li><li>Their food is mediocre at best.</li><li>For an upscale restaurant with prices in the $ 18 + range, their service and food was just not up to par.</li><li>I 'm never disappointed by the food here, especially the crusted beef panang curry.</li><li>Do n't be such a jerk- people 's food allergies are very serious.</li><li>The food was delicious.</li><li>( To see all the food and descriptions check out my photos).</li><li>I am used to eating authentic Thai cuisine, so that 's why I ca n't give the food a solid 5.</li><li>But one thing it 's for sure, I 'm not complaining at all about the taste and quality of the food.</li><li>When we complained about our disappointment and asked for another option the manager explained that because there was n't anything wrong with the food it could n't be changed.</li><li>The food 's not even great ............</li><li>The food however was a redeeming point.</li><li>It complimented the space, and the food that was to come.</li><li>The best food is always home cooked.</li><li>What I do remember is that the food is alright, and it wo n't get anymore than an alright from me.</li><li>But otherwise it was very good food!</li><li>The total lack of `` generosity'' with the accompaniments for the duck legs pretty much ruined the experience for us, in spite of the fact that we enjoyed the food.</li><li>Great food, but TERRIBLE customer service.</li><li>When you do get through, expect long waits for your food.</li><li>Again while the food is great ( delicious actually), it is highly priced and probably not worth the terrible and frankly at time cocky customer service.</li><li>I do feel while Linda 's provides a solid dining experience that it is a bit on the pricey side for Thai food.</li><li>Pricing for that quality of food was really terrible.</li><li>I feel they are seriously trying to accommodate the Canadian culture by sacrificing their original roots, Thai food!</li><li>Our waitress was very pleasant, and the food came quickly.</li><li>The service was a cut above and the food was good and satisfying enough to relieve the rigours of a long day.</li><li>Decent prices decent food.</li><li>There are so many other Thai restaurants out there, with good food and great service ( Pai, Sukho Thai, Eat BKK, Khao San Road etc).</li><li>Sadly, Yelp does n't give the option of NO STARS, because that is definitely what this restaurant deserves if judged by the service ( the food is about a 3).</li><li>Soon after, the good food flood gates flung open and we were served the beef pannang, fried duck, rice, and noodles.</li><li>Our second visit was the worse, it took forever for the food to come we almost wanted to leave the restaurant.</li><li>When the food finally arrived, they both came in a very thin omelette.</li><li>The chef makes his rounds non-intrusively table to table to see if his guests are enjoying their food.</li><li>Each time it 's been consistently good food -- the short ribs, the panang crusted beef, panang chicken, straw mushrooms, it 's all been good.</li><li>The food was really poor quality.</li><li>While dining, the waitress would converse with other diners, however she never checked in on our table once, other than to whisk away plates the moment our food was done- we felt rushed the whole time and the place was n't even busy!</li><li>The food is mediocre and there are better options in the area.</li><li>Well at least no one I 've ever had Food- ok this is what really counts!</li><li>The food is really good.</li><li>First of all, the food is horrible, service is so so but the overall experience was all negative.</li><li>The venue is nice and the restaurant looks really upscale, but the quality in the food was poor.</li><li>Amazing ambience and excellent food.</li><li>Linda is more of a fusion thai place where western style food meets some thai spices.</li><li>The food also took a bit longer to get to us, but our water was always filled and people were always checking on us to make sure we were okay.</li><li>The food was n't the best, but perhaps, their regular menu will be better.</li><li>The food was a 2, but the service and ambience brought it up to 3.</li><li>Servers in general were very pleasant and very quick to help out and refill the water ( even though it was very busy) I decided to try the winterlicous menu, which was reasonably priced at $ 18 I had some Thai sausage appetizer, the flavour was great, and the food temperature let me know it was just made.</li><li>Overall, the place looks really nice, but was not wowed by the food or the portion sizes.</li><li>Once in a while, she will come over to ask if the food is ok or if we need anything.</li><li>The food was exceptionally great!</li><li>The Owners have always been cheerful, with great memory, and served amazing food!</li><li>Seating was tight and the food was kind of `` Chinese-y'' if that makes any sense.</li><li>Great food good ambiance.</li><li>From the decor to the food this place really knows how to do Thai.</li><li>Speaking of wallets Linda is priced very well, its no salad-king but for the quality of food and service it is worth it.</li><li>The food is not authentic and soup seems to be watered down.</li><li>Why not just re-name the restaurant as Salad King because for all I know, the quality of food is just as sub-par as its downtown counterpart.</li><li>We were disappointed with the level of service and the food.</li><li>The server never came back to ask us how our food was, never once.</li><li>Disappointingly, after reassuring us that the items she had ordered were safe, her appetizer came out with cucumber ( what she is allergic to) as a garnish, which was touching her food.</li><li>The only reason I gave this place 2 stars was that the actual food itself was decent- but we were extremely disappointed and probably wo n't be back due to the poor customer service by management.</li><li>I am not a big fan of Thai food but the food there is an ok.</li><li>I am not a big fan of Thai food but the food there is an ok.</li><li>The service is consistently great and the food is superb.</li><li>Since I generally enjoy salty food, I had no problem finishing everything in my plate.</li><li>However, even I found their food a bit too salty and had to wash it down with 3 cups of water.</li><li>Although we were there for lunch, we ordered their Asianized cocktails to go with our food.</li><li>The food was amazing, our server was extremely accomodating.</li><li>I 've been here for lunch, for dinner, with small parties and with large groups- the food and the service is very consistent.</li><li>The venue is nice and the restaurant looks upscale, but the quality of the food was so so.</li><li>Overall, the service was great, but the food took a while to arrive.</li><li>We waited for about 30 minutes for our food.</li><li>I would certainly visit Linda Modern Thai again because the food has great flavours, but I would like to try the curry instead.</li><li>The food, the decor, the service.</li><li>It 's quite pricier than Salad King, but I think you 're more so paying for the ambiance than for the food.</li><li>The food is pretty much the same that they have at Salad King.</li><li>Yes the price is above average, but when the restaurant is so nicely decorated and the waiters pick every last piece of scrap that fell on the table then I can accept the higher prices- not to mention the food was awesome.</li><li>A bit pricy, but the decor, food and service will have to warrant that.</li><li>Amazing food!</li><li>Food is n't that great.</li><li>Now onto the food: Pad thai: rice noodles, carrots, peanuts, tofu, green onions, bean sprouts, coriander, egg, fish, and tamarind sauce with chicken.</li><li>I went here for the first legit meal after getting my tonsils removed ... maybe I was delusional and craved real food too much ... but it was excellent.</li><li>Joking, the food was good.</li><li>( PS: The whole time the restaurant was not packed at all) Food was nice, considered it was the Summerlicious menu.</li><li>Do not order Thai Fried Rice ( sea food) if you do n't like your food too salty and has a strong soy sauce and fish sauce taste.</li><li>The food here left me so disappointed!</li><li>Hey guys, here 's a tip ... if you were trying to cover all of the food groups, you missed dairy!* CUE THE LONGEST WAIT EVER FOR OUR MAIN COURSES* I got the green curry chicken, which was cold by the time it got to my table.</li><li>We give this top scale sister restaurant to salad King two thumbs down for the worst disguise on Thai food !!</li><li>It was n't cool when I walked out of Linda with an upset stomach after realizing the food here were too heavy for me to handle.</li><li>I actually find Salad King had better food.</li><li>The food were n't too bad but lacked complex flavours in Thai food.</li><li>My suggestions: Go to Salad King for the same food with half the price, or go to better Thai restaurants ( ex.</li><li>Khao San Road, Pai, etc) for better food for around the same price.</li><li>There really was n't a lot of food to be honest.</li><li>Overall pretty decent food.</li><li>The food: To start we both got the shrimp skewers and i got the tom yum soup and my boyfriend got the mango salad.</li><li>The food is n't too bad.</li><li>Overall, the food is good enough that I would go back for the food.</li><li>Overall, the food is good enough that I would go back for the food.</li><li>Bottom line: The food is 3.75 Stars, so we 'll round up to a 4.</li><li>Yes, it is a bit pricier than your average Thai food but the food is tasty and the ambience is on point.</li><li>The food is well overpriced for the quality.</li><li>Overall the decor was nice if not a bit superfluous, and the waitress was pleasant, but the food was very underwhelming and not worth it.</li><li>The food quality was ' ok' but I would never crave for this place.</li><li>You pay a large premium for good service and decor but the food is mediocre and small portion.</li><li>Linda 's is my definition of a GOOD fancy restaurant: Authentic food, moody atmosphere, and attentive service.</li><li>We got seated and the food came at a reasonable pace ( by that I mean, if we were n't busy in our conversation the entire time it was slow).</li><li>The food was overall good.</li><li>The price did not seem unreasonable for the quality of food.</li><li>The restaurant is not too big and looked quite busy during the weekend, but service was quick and the food was delicious.</li><li>Food was okay but my memories was that the place was better!</li><li>I believe if you want a better food experience head to the sister restaurant Salad King).</li><li>She was nice enough, but meanwhile our other food was getting cold and it ruined the mood for a romantic date.</li><li>Food is great.</li><li>While the ambiance is dark and cozy, the food was very quite modified to suite the typical North American palate.</li><li>Thai iced tea was n't the greatest either. after eating dinner at Linda, s modern thai last night, I would not refer anyone who like, s good thai food to go there.the food is plan, and the portions are very small, well the price, s are high. dinner with two dish, s and a small salad was around seventy five dollar, s.we had to pick up food on the way home as we were still not full.there are so many better thai place, s in Toronto.</li><li>The food was just mediocre for me and the prices were quite steep, as well.</li><li>The service was lacking, and the food was below average and over-priced to say the least.</li><li>Overall great food and great service.</li><li>Nice atmosphere Overpriced food!</li><li>It also seems that they spend more time on the food here as in the creative aspect of the dishes as well.</li><li>The food is great but I 'm not sure if I 'm willing to spend $ 20 for a tiny share of curry and rice.</li><li>I found it very expensive and our food too way too long ( entrees came out about 45 minutes after we ordered.)</li><li>You 'd get the same food at Salad King for a better price.</li><li>We ordered our mains and waited over an hour for our food!</li><li>Be forewarned- same quality food, but pretentious Shops on Don Mills prices ( $ 7 vs. $ 12).</li><li>Came here for dinner one night and really enjoyed the food.</li><li>She split our food for us at the end of the night equally which saved us the trouble of having to do it.</li><li>The food was not that outstanding and already over priced compare to other shops ... bad attitude not recommended.</li><li>Like other reviewers have mentioned, yes it is slightly more expensive than other places, I do find the quality of their food is very good.</li><li>She will not believe your comment their food was spoiled as if the customer deliberately ruin the bought food.</li><li>She will not believe your comment their food was spoiled as if the customer deliberately ruin the bought food.</li><li>Perhaps the food can be good at times, but the lady is hell bent to argue as if she is the victim and not the customer who paid for the bad food.</li><li>Perhaps the food can be good at times, but the lady is hell bent to argue as if she is the victim and not the customer who paid for the bad food.</li><li>It 's no fine dining but the food is delicious!</li><li>This made for an extremely awkward experience and a bit of a suspicion as to whether our food was going to be good ...</li><li>The food is fresh and plentiful.</li><li>Sometimes when you 're far away from home good company and good food is all you need.</li><li>The place is spacious, a little ugly, but you 're going to a place like Katz ' for the food, right ?</li><li>Good food, clean, people are great and quality is consistent.</li><li>Since it is cafeteria, one can also skimp on tipping, especially as you bus your own food.</li><li>You can tell all the food is homemade and made from scratch!</li><li>I picked up some chicken and matzoh ball soup for some sickies and some deli meats for myself. the food was delicious and the counter help was courteous.</li><li>The food quality was ok, but I 've had MUCH better ( and bigger) for MUCH less, even in NYC.</li><li>I 've eaten here a number of times &amp; it 's been around for years to me the food has always been delicious.</li><li>My husband and I were and found the food to be good and the sandwiches to be extremely generous in size.</li><li>Too expensive and the food just ai n't that good.</li><li>SUMMARY: Food itself was pretty standard, but the sub-par service means I 'll be going somewhere else for my Pho fix next time.</li><li>The good thing is that food is fresh and tastes alright as long as you expect to get Chinese food.</li><li>Sometimes maybe the staff sucks but the food is heaven, but it did n't happen today.</li><li>The food is not bad but I am giving it one star for obnoxious service because the server and owner hassled one of our party about sending back a dish.</li><li>While the interior is n't bad, the food is n't anything special and the service is terrible.</li><li>Mediocre food!</li><li>Why bother with mediocre food and horrible service!</li><li>The food was ok but the portions were small.</li><li>Its always littered with loud mouthed teenagers, service is rude and slow and Ive found hair in my food more than once.</li><li>OK let me explain ... nowhere in the city are you going to get a meal for $ 3.00, but here you can ... the issues are they often do not have food.</li><li>OK OK OK, you 're thinking it 's so good they are sold out, NOPE ... not the case as I have went in when they first open to be told they do n't have food.</li><li>I dare not look around the kitchen, how the food is handled, or the lack of decor.</li><li>Will not support these guys although I like the flavour of their food.</li><li>Another time I went there and got a lb of pork and the food was COLD.</li><li>I did n't notice when he gave it to me because I took it home but I had to put the food in the oven.</li><li>Even so, where the heck are you gonna curb a mammoth-scale huger with moderately tasty and marginally nutritious food for under a $ 7 these days ?</li><li>Great price great food!</li><li>She was singing songs and was having a great time whipping up the food.</li><li>Pick up your food.</li><li>Great Food.</li><li>I will never come back again, terrible food terrible restaurant.</li><li>I do n't even normally eat red meat, but they had so many lamb things on the menu, and all the scents of the food around us smelled so good, I decided this worth a compromise, and it totally was.</li><li>Every Lamb and Beef dish on this picture friendly menu is AWESOME. go in for a warm lamb stew or chef 's special soup in the winter, or cool garlic cucumbers in the summer. their beef or lamb chinese style pancakes are YUM -- delightfully puffy and filled with perfectly seasoned meat. their house special beef noodle soup is cravable! you can taste the time and love in the soup base. ughh so goooood .. and the hand pulled noodles are as real as they get outside of la chine. seriously ? who cooks like this anymore outside of china ? -- these are classic techniques! the decor is kind of hilarious though, a lil step up from a hole in the wall, it 's definitely clean, but it also feels like you 're in the middle of nowhere china, really really first gen. like you 've escaped the city. and nothing matches. the walls are cheerily painted like you 're walking into the plateaus deep into china, starkly contrasting the leather booths and the crazy yellow seat covers that match the trilingual waitress 's outfits ( they mainly speak mandarin, some canto, and english). the TVs are always playing old 50 's chinese black &amp; white talkies, and there are neon signs boasting great halel food! the chef is usually out and about greeting the customers- he 's won awards for his food, and i agree -- this place is seriously the best regional lamb and beef dishes that 's hit the east side of this city since ... johnny 's burgers. i highly recommend this place! because i 'd be so sad to see it go under because no one knows about it. deserves my YUM YUM approval fo sheezie;).</li><li>Every Lamb and Beef dish

looking restaurant.</li><li>Food is fresh and very light and comes in a good quantity for the price.</li><li>It 's sort of unfortunately located, but the food absolutely makes up for its location and questionable decor choices.</li><li>Great authentic northern Chinese/Xinjiang food.</li><li>The restaurant serves up Xinjiang/Chinese Muslim style food in a sad looking strip mall up in Scarberia.</li><li>Excellent food, fantastic value nice quick service and very friendly atmosphere.</li><li>Food was ok.</li><li>Very different food but definitely must try for a taste of China that you can only get here.</li><li>They had a small store up in Scarborough but their food is better here.</li><li>The food is good and cheap.</li><li>Food is okay.</li><li>Waitress knows nothing about the food she serves.</li><li>First time at this location but have been to the other locations a few times and the food is always great.</li><li>The food came out pretty fast within 10 minutes of our order and the price is quite reasonable.</li><li>Overall I do like this place, their food is generally pretty good and if you like lamb, you should check it out.</li><li>Fair pricing and delicious food except their fish.</li><li>Great food, decent prices, nice atmosphere, super friendly service.</li><li>Service was indifference and cold .... but I got my food fast, hot and delicious ......... for all I care, that 's most important!</li><li>My friend said the food is actually classified as Islamic, so all the dishes are lamb or beef.</li><li>Although food is delicious but expensive.</li><li>The Food was very good, and the restaurant had an authentic feel.</li><li>I can only describe the food as a bit `` heavy''; this is about as far away from salad as it gets.</li><li>Food tasted great.</li><li>The food here is prepared with care; but I have one gripe.</li><li>The food is just not hot ( warm) enough when it comes to the table.</li><li>My first stop was Chinese Beef and Lamb House, I chose this place for the Halal food and beef/ lamb specialties.</li><li>Excellent service and very delicious and flavourful food.</li><li>However even with the poor service, the food was very good and very well priced.</li><li>The good thing about restaurant though is they have dishes from all over China, of course nothing are quite live up to the authentic standard; another good thing about this place is nothing is very spicy so it 's good for ppl who ca n't handle spicy food.</li><li>Really good food.</li><li>Overall very good quality food and the décor and ambience is decent.</li><li>I do n't know if this is some sort of regional Chinese thing or it really is it more of a fusion type Chinese food. i do n't know. all i know is the food is damn good here.</li><li>Disclaimer: this was my first northern Chinese halal meal ever, so I could only review based on if I enjoyed the food and experience.</li><li>There was a cold draft everywhere in this restaurant that made the experience a little uncomfortable at first, but when the tea and the food came I did n't notice it as much.</li><li>I LOVE the food from this part the world and am always open to try new places that open up.</li><li>Decor, space, and service were all amazing BUT the food was n't ( mind you this is dependent if you fancy Mongolian cuisine) I surprisingly found the curry fish to taste scrumptious but other items such as friend potato and noodles to be bland and in some cases very oily I would recommend this for someone craving traditional Chinese cuisine but if you are like me who enjoy Hakka style more I would avoid this place.</li><li>For someone looking for authentic halal chinese food, Chinese Halal restaurant is a saviour.</li><li>Very good food and service here: the servers were All very attentive and helpful with recommending various choices on the menu.</li><li>The overall food is well below average when compared to some of the other places like Matsuda or Tenichi.</li><li>I can at least say that the service was good, food came quick and we never had to wait to give the waiter our menu selections.</li><li>Ordered for the first time yesterday at 734pm and the food only came at 830pm.</li><li>Because the food came late it was n't warm anymore to start.</li><li>There was no effort put into this food.</li><li>When you are serving me RAW food- I want to know you 're taking the correct measures to assure me you 're serving and handling food properly.</li><li>The food was quick and the staff were friendly The worst sushi I had was anything to do with salmon.</li><li>And the rest of the food came which included the sushi rolls and bean sprout stir fry.</li><li>Surprisingly great food for next to nothing.</li><li>The sushi is really good and there is a wide variety of food.</li><li>Last time the food was n't good tho so I have n't been ever since ( 2months).</li><li>I recommend you go during the weekends since the food is fresh.</li><li>They had good food and good service too But the hygiene level around you looks a bit questionable.</li><li>Simply disgusting food!</li><li>The food is very fresh, not sure about during dinner but it was good both times I have gone here.</li><li>Most the food was lukewarm to cold.</li><li>The food is like any other all you can east sushi place it 's clean and small, the waiter is very rude and blunt he sneezed into his hand 3 times right on the floor !!</li><li>The cooked food items are also a great choice too.</li><li>The food does n't take too long to come out except for the cooked items for obvious reasons.</li><li>The service has never been anything but prompt and courteous, and the food is always fresh and delicious!</li><li>The food was quick to come, but had to ask for soy sauce and tea couple of times, he kept of forgetting it.</li><li>Its a nice restaurant and the food is quite good, seems to be run by a family.</li><li>Food: Mostly standard.</li><li>They have two menus, premium menu and the cheaper one, we got the cheaper one and the food was really good.</li><li>Also the servers are very nice and the food comes fast.</li><li>We were not paying to be treated like that, nor eat disgusting food that could make us sick.</li><li>First time at Tekka Sushi, was very happy with the food, service and the environment.</li><li>The food was mouth watering, absolutely delicious and the actual sushi was huge.</li><li>It was delicious and just the right amount of food.</li><li>No need to talk to a human- just plunk in your order, get the receipt and then wait for your food!</li><li>If you ca n't be bothered with a drive in ( personally I like to stand by and watch the people who make my food like a hawk so they ca n't do something undesirable with it ..) and then lines inside are long then there is this option to speed things up.</li><li>I have been here many times and their food and service is great.</li><li>All the food ( especially empanadas, humitas, tamales) is delicious but I 've found that the fish fillet has reduced in size from what it was before.</li><li>3/5 for food.</li><li>This might be the best Caribbean/Indian food I 've had.</li><li>The food is great, the vegetarian options plentiful, the service friendly, the portions generous and the price is low.</li><li>It 's cheap and cheerful food in my opinion.</li><li>It 's definitely now one of my go-to places for good middle eastern food.</li><li>It 's plenty of food and the service is better later in the evening with less patrons.</li><li>It 's not spectacular but very solid tasting food.</li><li>The food was amazing.</li><li>It is hit or miss. In my last time here, the food was not fresh at all.</li><li>I 've been going to Armenian Kitchen since the mid-90s and the food is consistently delicious, fresh and well-priced.</li><li>Delicious food and reasonable prices!</li><li>It 's nice, quiet, good food, large quantities and reasonably priced!</li><li>Basically, a good place to get some tasty middle-eastern food in a setting that 's not quite as `` fast-food'' as most of the middle-eastern places in Toronto.</li><li>I 'm going to lump it into ' middle-eastern food'.</li><li>I highly recommend, if this kind of food and homey atmosphere is your thing.</li><li>This is straight up middle eastern food: falafel, tabbouleh, shawarma, etc.</li><li>Horrible food cold food old food ...</li><li>Horrible food cold food old food ...</li><li>Horrible food cold food old food ...</li><li>We ordered shawarma plates and the food came to our table super quickly so we wondered how could that be!</li><li>I am not sure why people r raving about this place- r we tasting sane food.</li><li>Their food is of the middle east family.</li><li>Very good food.</li><li>There is nothing Armenian about this restaurant unless you consider Arabic food to be Armenian.</li><li>Service was not good as the waitress decided that her shift had ended and made us pay for the food before we even got a chance to eat it.</li><li>As for the Arabic ( yes Arabic) food they served us, nothing special about it.</li><li>Overall Armenian kitchen has the right idea, makes adequate food but could be so much better with a few tweaks.</li><li>If you 've grown up with this food, then you 'll feel like you 're eating at home.</li><li>The food makes up for it!</li><li>You definitely do n't come for the Decor but the food is authentic and prepared with care and all round awesome!</li><li>That said, the food is great!</li><li>Very mom and pop feeling including the delicious authentic food.</li><li>Food is always fantastic !!</li><li>The area itself is sketchy, but if you can look past that, the food is definitely legit.</li><li>There was only one server but the wait was n't long and the food was super fresh.</li><li>It 's actually got some very good food.</li><li>The food was great, everything was cooked perfectly.</li><li>Again the food was not fresh and I was watching the kitchen this time and that microwave just kept on going off.</li><li>The food was disgusting.</li><li>I am not spending my hard earned money on microwaved food.</li><li>The food is authentic and fabulous.</li><li>I never leave without food to take home- hummous, baba and tabouleh in summer ... lentil soup in winter.</li><li>After reading a lot of good reviews, I was there to have some middle eastern food.</li><li>It truly is a Scarboro icon, and if you like middle eastern food, the food at this place will satisfy your urges.</li><li>It truly is a Scarboro icon, and if you like middle eastern food, the food at this place will satisfy your urges.</li><li>The decor has n't really changed in the past 15 years, it could use a bit of updating, however the food is what brings you here.</li><li>I wish there was someplace downtown that offered the same quality food for the value offered here.</li><li>They are accurate, the place has great food.</li><li>Kivas had a change in management many years back- and they have done a great job stepping up the menu and food a few notches.</li><li>About standard pricing $ 9 range for Benny Kids breakfast is really nice- not cheap but good portion The place is a bit small, but the food is fresh, you can see the guys making it.</li><li>Two stars because the food was ok.</li><li>This last thing is a bit nitpicky but the pictures of the food in the menu looked like they were taken on a cheap cell phone, not appetizing looking at all.</li><li>Businesses should really spend a couple hundred bucks to get a pro to take the pictures of their food because if you do n't, right away it makes your place look like it cuts corners and is mediocre, which this place is.</li><li>When we first arrived, I actually overheard the table next to us exclaim that the menu and the food had changed so much since they had last dropped in ~ 7 months ago.</li><li>The food is just your average breakfast and lunch options.</li><li>My wife and I have going there for years and find their food consistently excellent and made to order.</li><li>The food was good but the chefs very touching everything with their hands.</li><li>Overall most of the food was undercooked, the server lacked attentiveness, and I actually left more than 50% of my meal.</li><li>Great food, great service, not expensive.</li><li>This place serves up tasty food!</li><li>I was kind enough to give away a few:) Moderate prices, good food, a keeper!</li><li>I found the food not as greasy as other all-day breakfast diners which was a plus to me.</li><li>You can also get freshly squeezed orange juice here along with some damn good food.</li><li>The service was great and the food was okay, but we will likely not make the trek here again.</li><li>Was n't too impressed by the food.</li><li>Great food, nice bottomless cup of coffee, really like the homefries and good service.</li><li>I would n't suggest the pancakes, not the best I 've had. ordered egg benedict with smoked salmon ( $ 9.99) and classic french toast ( $ 9.99) with sausage. very good food but service was a bit slow. nice environment and quiet. polite waitress.good for breakfast and brunch, a lot of couples were dining there.the hollandise sauce was a bit different from others ' diners, a little bit less sour and dense, but still we loved the taste!</li><li>The food, coffee, and service were adequate for the money, but seated at the back with so many people packed in I ca n't say it was exactly pleasant.</li><li>I use to love going to this place but the food has become bleh ... it arrived luke warm NOT hot .. it was colder inside the restaurant ... then outside ...</li><li>Later on my daughter and her boyfriend went and said the same thing food was horrible except for the baked pasta .. that was the only fresh HOT dish that came.</li><li>Yes, the waiters are friendly, however waiting for them to approach you, take your order, bring you the stuff ( e.g. water, food, etc.) took forever, literally more than 30 minutes.</li><li>However, the food here tastes pretty good.</li><li>Wait staff does n't acknowledge you ( was n't til 10 minutes later she got our drink order), food came 30 mins after, the server 's excuse was `` we had a lot of chicken wing orders tonight''.</li><li>Menu looked great; however very pricey for PUB food.</li><li>Then our drinks were done, and we wondered where our food was.</li><li>Restaurant: The Lobster Trap Cuisine: Seafood Location: North Toronto Address: 1962 Avenue Road Price Range: $ 25 and up 1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent Food: 3 Service: 4 Ambiance: 2 Overall: 3 Extra information:* Only open at dinner* Can choose your own lobster After having a taste of lobster from Maple Yip the other day, my dad was surprised to see us enjoy lobster so much.</li><li>There were 5 of us so we asked our server how much food would be enough for us and she said 6lbs of lobster from couple other dishes would be enough to fill us up.</li><li>But putting ambiance aside, the service is still as personable as ever and the food is still great.</li><li>Would have loved to have tried the food but the staff need to do better.</li><li>The food was alright, but would I ever come back or recommend it to anyone ?</li><li>Showed up with reservations on a friday evening and ordered 8 $ 80 worth of food.</li><li>I ended up paying way more than i expected for food that was just average at best.</li><li>Stay away from this restaurant you have been warned. it 'll be the first time and most likely the last time i 'll go there. i had high expectations of a place that has lobster in their name coupled with the fact that they are in one of the more higher end areas of the city. maybe that 's the downfall. from the outside, it looks like a place that you 'd find in a old strip mall, and the interior 's more of the same. when i saw that the food and wine menu were both laminated, i started to get an idea as to what i was getting myself into both pricewise and food quality. our server was not the most attentive to our needs even though we were a group of 12, and was noticibly pushing certain items on the menu. there were also a couple of kids with us and she was n't the most friendliest person with them, seemingly just focused on doin what she needed to do to make her coin and turning the table over. not that i find it wrong but it 's not something i 'd expect from a place that you 're paying up to $ 94 for a four pound lobster. me and my friend ordered garlic shrimps to start. they were of a decent size and flavour but were lacked presentation and quantity for what we paid. i 'm not really concerned with presentation that much on the regular but the plate they served it on made it look like we were n't getting a lot or we were missing something. we both ordered a 1lb lobster with baked potato and soup. we were informed that the french fries were not available which again i would n't expect from a place where you are paying so much for your meal. my soup was a new england clam chowder that was nothing special at all. the soup nutsy or even the marche had better. the baked potato was plain with just a small dollop of sour cream to consume it with. the final item to arrive was the lobster. i ordered for it to be broiled which it did but the ' stuff' ( cause i do n't really know what the heck they decided to put on it) just made it a very messy proposition to eat. it did n't really do much to enhance the enjoyment of the lobster, and it made me wonder was it really worth the coin i just dropped for this. the whole meal just tasted only just average. the whole experience was topped off when our bill came and our waitress almost made it a point to point out that the gratuity was not included in our bill. if you really want lobster, i would just say to go to red lobster and do it there. you 'd probably pay just the same but the service would definitely be better and so would the flavours !!</li><li>: D price is fair and food is delicious.</li><li>The food was fresh and worth the extra spend.</li><li>Great food and live entertainment ?</li><li>I recently found a deal for $ 25 for $ 50 worth of food at the Lobster Trap and decided to re-visit this restaurant.</li><li>SERVICE: 3.5/5 stars- They were initially slow to take our order but the waitress came and moved things along and our food came on time.</li><li>- Quality- they really need to re-evaluate the quality of this food Unless the manager/owner wants to keep this place a Groupon Haven, they better smarten up and re-vamp this restaurant to make it look better and present better and perhaps revise their menu as well.</li><li>Excellent service and food.</li><li>The food itself was okay ( heard the partner splitted and there is another location in Vaughn but it is even worst there).</li><li>If you want good food and down to earth wait straff and low key restaurant, this is the place to go.</li><li>Restaurants that are not good do not usually get full and have low food turnover so you never know if what you are getting is fresh.</li><li>It was supposed to be a special occasion and both the food and service were not great.</li><li>After we politely reminded her she was very apologetic and our drinks came promptly after that.* been to the other lobster trap and have to say this one is much better as far as service and quality of food* I will definitely be back as she was so kind to give us 50 $ off for next time!</li><li>Food was so overly priced it was scary.</li><li>I swear the food was better when I was here a couple years ago.</li><li>Verdict: At this price point, I would expect consistent food and better service.</li><li>Amazing service, outstanding food and comfortable atmosphere.</li><li>I thought the food and price must be outstanding to compensate for the state of the restaurant, and gasp when I open the menu.</li><li>We went with my friend 's couple because they really liked the food and service last year.</li><li>The food was not presented nicely, and while the lobster seemed fresh, the taste was n't rich enough for the 1 1/2 broiled lobster ( $ 49).</li><li>We were trying to be nice on a Christmas Eve and look past all that since it was a relatively busy night ( It 's a Christmas Eve, so the ' new' owner should have got more people working), but when the time came to pay for our food and leave, the owner was giving us a very arrogant attitude, saying, `` What do you want me to do about it ?'', not in a polite tone, to say the least.</li><li>Came here in a group of 4 using a voucher I had purchased from buytopia ( $ 30 for $ 70 worth of food on weekdays or for $ 60 on weekends) on Saturday.</li><li>Anyways, fine, we decided to change our order and get lobster grandin ( appetizer $ 12), garlic jumbo shrimp ( entree $ 32), and 1 1/4 steamed lobster ( entree $ 36) for now to see how the food is then get more later if we like the foods ( yes we were that scared).</li><li>FOOD: the food came pretty fast probably because we came as soon as it opened. garlic bread was alright- nothing special. lobster bisque ( $ 10) was pretty good- I think this is their specialty since the owner wanted us to try it so bad. lobster grandin ( $ 12) was alright.</li><li>OVERALL: Generously putting it, everything about the food was really below average and definitely NOT worth all that money.</li><li>I know seafood is expensive, but for the high price I 'm paying and the small portion I get, I expect some kind of uniqueness and exceptional quality in the food and good service from the servers.</li><li>The bill, with tip, came to $ 340 which was outrageous for the quality of food we received and the horrible service.</li><li>But the quality of the food is really quite poor.</li><li>Other food: Your meal starts with a free basket of garlic bread.</li><li>The good- the food is really quite tasty.</li><li>I could stand the poor decor and service when the food was good.</li><li>We got our food delivered but afterwards noticed they did n't have the 2L pop we ordered.</li><li>TL; DR decent food; delivery questionable.</li><li>For now, I 'm not too pleased with the quality, the quantity &amp; the preparation of the veggie platter I bought yesterday ( tasteless, not fresh, less food).</li><li>The options for vegetarians are all verrrry similar and I felt like the food lacked flavour and had been sitting too long.</li><li>Great little place with just plain old good food and nice service.</li><li>It 's worth it for the food though.</li><li>The place is clean, the service is good, and the food is tasty it 's definitely one of the better Vietnamese places in the area.</li><li>Delicious food and great drinks!</li><li>Excellent food and great staff.</li><li>As with most mom and pop shops, you can really taste the love and care the owners put into their food.</li><li>It 's best to call in your order though, good food takes time.</li><li>This food can heal what ails you.</li><li>I have been here for lunch a couple of times and keep telling my wife how good the food is and how cheap it is.</li><li>She finally got me to take her and the food did not disappoint.</li><li>Ordering was quick and easy since the place is so small and the owner you see in the pictures on Yelp was the guy who took our order and went back to help cook the food.</li><li>They do have affordable lunch specials from 11am-3pm that start at $ 3.99 so I might be back to try more of their food and the potato balls.</li><li>This was my first time at this place and the food did not let me down!</li><li>I only ever got take out though because the atmosphere is pretty grimy but holy hell the food is amazing! 6/5 for the roti, it 's that good.</li><li>Food is amazing, prices are good.</li><li>Our food took a while to make, but it came out piping hot, so I 'm not complaining.</li><li>Each time the food, roti and flavours have been excellent.</li><li>Great food at this place No matter what location you go to Turnips BBQ Pork Udon Shanghai Noodles Even the Thai food is decent Have had both the mango salad and the pad thai is quite yummy My parents have always ordered their Chinese food since it arrived We 'll definitely keep ordering from here.</li><li>Great food at this place No matter what location you go to Turnips BBQ

definitely keep ordering from here.</li><li>I 've been to congee King/Queen in scarborough and it was delicious there and this place had tons of ppl so I 'm sure there is reason for it but I just did n't enjoy my food.</li><li>Price range for their food is reasonable, for $ 10.95 you can get a huge noodle or rice dish which is totally worth.</li><li>We decided to come here for a late night take out dinner and with the `` word of mouth'' about this place for their food, we had to give them a try!</li><li>All the the food was still smok' in hot by the time we got home.</li><li>They put some effort in assuring that their food would be as fresh and hot as it would have been if we had eaten there.</li><li>The food was AWESOME and we definitely have found our new `` go too'' place for when we 're crav' in Asian!</li><li>The beef brisket meat were better than I expected since Congee Wong does n't always have the beat quality food.</li><li>The quality and quantity of the food here is on point!</li><li>Good food and fast service.</li><li>Their food is consistent and tasty.</li><li>My family does n't mind though because the food is reasonably priced, in big portions, and it arrives fast.</li><li>It was really busy but the food did not take long to come out.</li><li>And the food at the `` flagship'' restaurant at Steeles &amp; Don Mills is never quite as good as the Lawrence location.</li><li>The pictures on the menu are accurate to what the food looks like and it tastes great. hmm, i see a trend here. yet another `` chinese'' restaurant in my neighbourhood where we waited for ten-fifteen minutes with no server ( and this time we were one of two whole tables in the place). and again, i walked out. i 'd heard decent reviews from friends, never got a chance to see if the food was any good. smells great! poor/nonexistent service.</li><li>The pictures on the menu are accurate to what the food looks like and it tastes great. hmm, i see a trend here. yet another ``

assortment is amazing.</li><li>After we finally got served, the food did arrive fairly quickly and was pretty good.</li><li>I really enjoyed the food here, but it was unfortunately not the greatest service.</li><li>The food was all pretty good, and I particularly enjoyed the squid which was just delicious!</li><li>The food here is affordable and totally worth the quality and quantity you are getting.</li><li>The food was awesome and the seafood was off the hook.</li><li>You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the congee queen Friday night and the lights are low Looking out for the place to go Where they make chow mien, getting in the swing You come in to look for chicken a la king Anybody could be that guy Night is young

was ready- good timely service, even during dinner on a holiday. i was impressed with that. ca n't say the same for dine-in, as there were many people waiting to be seated. that 's to be expected though. the food was pretty good. got the seafood super bowl congee ( much smaller portion compared to dine-in), bbq sparerib with honey ( these were eh- i swear they tasted better last time), vegetable with mixed mushroom ( eh- not enough mushrooms imo), snow pea leaves ( not sure what it 's called on the menu, but these were pretty good). overall everything was pretty average. not sure if the food was a bit lower quality since there 's such a big rush of customers on mother 's day ? i 've come here a couple times before and the food was definitely better. i 'd still come back though and recommend this restaurant.</li><li>Never again. got take out from here for mother 's day dinner. called at 6.15, they said our order would be ready in 35 minutes. when we got there, everything was

restaurant.</li><li>Besides this I found overall the food was poo quality, in meat cut, and quite greasy.</li><li>Excellent food.</li><li>Everytime I go to this place the food in incredible, hot, and comes out extremely fast.</li><li>The menu has some really nice photos of the food -- beware that serving sizes are large, larger than the photos, so do n't order more than you need because you expect the serving sizes to be smaller than they are.</li><li>Lived up to their reputation for delicious food, with large portions and served quickly.</li><li>Good food!</li><li>I will be coming back for the food, but not for the service, very slow and we were ignored for much of the meal.</li><li>I am a regular at Congee Queen at the Markham location, and always thought their food tasted good.</li><li>I know my food.</li><li>Food is awesome and price is right!</li><li>Their food is very well priced and served fairly quickly, especially for such a busy place.</li><li>For the most part most of the food being congee or noodles or excessively deep ffried would violate my diet.</li><li>Getting back to the food.</li><li>The price was n't too bad for the fact that we ordered their specials rather than the standard fare food.</li><li>By the time 15 minutes later that we arrive to pick up our food, they are ready to be picked up at the counter.</li><li>We pay for the food after checking against the order list.</li><li>The food is solid for the most part.</li><li>Food was good but i was disappointed with the customer service.</li><li>The waiter pushed our table so it no longer hit our table but it was too late because it touched our food.</li><li>Although the lady managing that night apologized she insisted our food was okay to eat.</li><li>Honestly, if she just apologized and offered to remake the food and give us better discount, i would write a better review .. if they gave us a free meal, i would definitely come back.</li><li>The prices vary on what kind of items you want in the food.</li><li>My four stars are for the food and 1 star if i could for the staff.</li><li>Luckily, the food here is served fast -- it 's the waiting around for a table that can be a bear.</li><li>But food still came out fast.</li><li>Their food is consistently good.</li><li>And let 's not forget that this restaurant has the best combination of yummy food and awesome prices- I mean, no wonder you see so many large groups here.</li><li>Sometimes it is a drag to have to get your waiter 's attention for stuff ... like constantly, but, you really come here for the food.</li><li>The food is good though the portions are smaller than some other congee places, and the place is bright and clean.</li><li>The food was good, but most importantly CQ allowed us to import 15.5 asians into the restaurant and combine two large round tables so we can all steal food for each other and make jokes across the table at the top of our lungs.</li><li>The food was good, but most importantly CQ

food is all hot and fresh when it comes out and tastes just as it does at all the other places ( consistency is so important).</li><li>The food came right away.</li><li>All the food was really good.</li><li>When we told the server that we did n't want to take any of the food home, he did n't seem surprised.</li><li>Customer service is not very good. really excellent food, large diverse menu, generous portions. will certainly be back.</li><li>Left all the food and went to eat at home.</li><li>That 's right: floor food.</li><li>They do have a few saving graces: excellent food, super prices and TONS of high chairs.</li><li>Great food that upholds the standard across the other Congee Queen locations.</li><li>Food was good but service was horrible.</li><li>I 'm not sure if it was our waiter but the food took forever.</li><li>We ordered things and only 2 came out, waited for 15 minutes after we finished the rest of our food and it still did not come so we had to ask the waiter again to see if our food was done.</li><li>We ordered things and only 2 came out, waited for 15 minutes after we finished the rest of our food and it still did not come so we had to ask the waiter

place is clean, service is quick, and the food is excellent.</li><li>I 'm glad I 'll always remember the yummy food and only be filled with happiness and tummy rumblings .... not shame and regret like other things ..</li><li>As with all the other Congee Queen locations, I 've experienced the same level of service and quality of food which is actually kinda impressive considering how many locations there are.</li><li>The quality of the food overall is quite good, I find it 's better than a lot of other Chinese restaurants.</li><li>Ok food.</li><li>I will return to sample more good food.</li><li>This food was gross.</li><li>I used to go here often but I realized their food was n't that good ...</li><li>The food can be plain &amp; the service is eh.</li><li>The food comes surprisingly fast, which is kind of amazing.</li><li>To be honest it 's kind of amazing to me how a chinese food restaurant can bring your food before other restaurants even start making your food.</li><li>Food is always very good Friendly wait staff is important to me and this place is seriously lacking that.</li><li>How could they have scrub in the food ?</li><li>Their service is very quick and the food is placed on your table after a few minutes of ordering.</li><li>Food was hot, tasty and very fresh.</li><li>I would visit the Congee Queen again- the menu is extensive ( much more than congee), the food was prepared with care and the staff were very attentive.</li><li>Great food, but DO NOT and I really emphasized this, DO NOT expect any service.</li><li>Their food is generally quite good.</li><li>A friend of mine dropped by for lunch and I recommended them as the food is tasty especially when eaten in the restaurant ( normally I used take out) We ordered 3 dishes and a couple rice bowls.</li><li>We forced ourselves to finish the food, paid and left.</li><li>Service was always typical Chinese restaurant quality/ but food was always good ...</li><li>Fast service, great food.</li><li>The price is great and the food is usually good!</li><li>It is best to go with a person who knows the food the first time.</li><li>Overall, this is a great place with great food.</li><li>I 'm giving this restaurant 4 stars based on the following criteria: taste, affordability and quantity The food always comes out fast, hot ( not like at Spring Rolls !!) and fresh.</li><li>However, I 've found that the quality of food has gone down over this past year.</li><li>I can live with that when the food is this much tasty.</li><li>To compare it to China town, the food has more flavour and less greasy.</li><li>The food and service has always been good, repeatedly, time after time.</li><li>The quality of food is great, and priced reasonably.</li><li>Overall, great food and service at this location.</li><li>Oh forgive me Yelp gods, because this is one of the biggest food regrets I have of 2013.</li><li>Food selection is great Food was great.</li><li>Ca n't go wrong with the food, never had any issues with it either.</li><li>Food is great for it 's value- great for those craving some good Chinese food and those families or individuals who want to dine for a moderate price.</li><li>And it tastes better when the food soaks in all the flavors over night!</li><li>Clean restaurant and some delicious food.</li><li>Park here, and after your meal you can waddle off the food in the Shops at Don Mills.</li><li>Nice desserts, large portion, good price and food comparing with similar restaurants.</li><li>The food are not the best, but worth that price.</li><li>It was fast service excellent food quality and cost was not high but affordable, good portions to share with family or friends.</li><li>Food tasted alright though.</li><li>So addivitviely good Service is quick place is clean and food is delicious.</li><li>The food here is a joke.</li><li>Food is good but so simple.</li><li>Food is pretty good.</li><li>Food was prepared pretty fast so this is our go-to place when we need a quick dinner and want to catch a movie after work.</li><li>Very very disappointed I have to say, the food was not fresh, the beef was almost a blackish color and tasted sour, when I pointed out to the waitrese and the manager, they said that 's the way it should be.</li><li>I 've been eating there for about 6 years now, and I notice the quality of the food ( in general, not just the cheap specials) started getting really bad since mid September this year.</li><li>Food was so so ... bland and not much meat.</li><li>The food is generally a little better here than the tea shop around, but not that good either. the service is not very satisfactory.</li><li>Btw the food tastes so bad.</li><li>Do n't get me wrong, the food here is great.</li><li>Really, there 's no complain so far but this does n't mean their service and all their food is 4 stars.</li><li>The food is pretty much the same, maybe a little bit better.</li><li>The food was okay, but the portions are small, considering the price.</li><li>I 've tried their food few times.</li><li>Even the waitress felt that oddity when she was serving the food and started explaining that the cooks told her that it 's a kind of alleged bok choy, but she could n't finish her sentence ( showing that she did n't know what she was talking about- probably because she was n't explained by the cooks properly that wth was that).</li><li>Not to mention every time I go there, my shirt gets smelly ( that does n't happen with other restaurants) which shows the bad restaurant set up and probably non-standard ingredients in their food ...</li><li>Overall the food quality was good and similar to the other location, but the menu has limited options due to the restaurant size.</li><li>The food and drink was really good, definitely will go back there again as it 's close to me and has pretty good deals.:).</li><li>We ordered 3 drinks and a lunch combo, the drinks came fast but the food took forever, seems like there was only 1 person working in the kitchen.</li><li>The food came on a small plate where everything is little in portion.</li><li>Taste of the food was just average, not worth the price paid for it!</li><li>As we were leaving the food that was sprawled about different tables looked tasty, will have to give it a shot sometime.</li><li>I like the food here, especially the chicken cutlet ( tender &amp; tasty), the deep fried fish ( generous portion and never fishy ... you know what I mean!) and the Taiwanese sausage ( can be ordered on it 's own or comes with the minced pork on rice with tea egg.)</li><li>We came here in a group of 6 hungry after a volleyball game loss eager for some bubble tea and taiwanese food.</li><li>However, the service is pretty awful here, the food is mediocre ( portions are quite small) and the price is INFLATED and definitely not worth the asking price for most drinks.</li><li>Bubble tea and food here is more expensive than your typical Tea Shop 168 and is supposedly `` better''.</li><li>I only recommend this place if you really want bubble tea and taiwanese style food.</li><li>That shows me either the food is great, the service is great or both.</li><li>They do n't have many food options mostly snacks.</li><li>Good food.</li><li>A lot of Korean restaurants around Yonge and Finch are very good in terms of food but a bit snobby in terms of service.</li><li>The food was very good.</li><li>The food is not bad .. but two major issues here.</li><li>Overall, I would say the food is quite satisfying.</li><li>It is n't the prettiest place on the street, but it delivers where it counts most ( the food).</li><li>By the time food comes ( not a very long wait at all) the ban chan has usually been devoured, but refills are never given unless yo flag them down and ask for it.</li><li>Seeing as BH is located in the `` Koreatown North'', I 'm surprised that they can survive serving the kind of food they do.</li><li>Indifferent service, below average food and paid parking ....</li><li>If you ca n't put out food in 30 minutes, do not open for lunch.</li><li>Make sure you wear layers, because the place is hot + the food is hot.</li><li>The food was only so-so for me.</li><li>Each topping costs double because it 's for 2 people and we did n't even get that much food.</li><li>The amount of food just right and the taste of the food was amazing.</li><li>I wish they would have given us a spoon to scoop the food out into our bowl.</li><li>The service was ok, but the food was n't good at all.</li><li>Pro Unlimited side dishes ( the mashed potatoes are awesome) Con Some of the food was undercooked or extremely hard.</li><li>The food was adequate, but in the North York area there are many superior places.</li><li>The cheapness of the dishes should have been a reflection of the food and we should have stayed away, however it was because it was all so cheaply priced that we did n't feel that ripped off walking out of.</li><li>Decent food ( especially since there are no other dak galbi places in Toronto) but service is TERRIBLE and portions are tiny !!!</li><li>I 've been here with just one other person, and another time with a large group and both times we were n't served enough food.</li><li>WHY would I pay 50% more to get the same amount of food ?!</li><li>Average food .. poor service !!!</li><li>I could n't remember ever eating at a Korean restaurant, and I 'm having trouble remembering exactly what he had, but I remember it being tasty and I tried some of everyone 's food.</li><li>The couple beside us ordered after us, but they got their food before us which was NOT fair.</li><li>Their table was SO close to ours like how hard is it to give us our food too ?</li><li>How is it fair that we got sat at the same time, we ordered first, but they got their food first ?</li><li>No matter how much I love their food ..</li><li>Price wise I am satisfied with for the quality of food.</li><li>The food was not bad, tasty but I would probably not go back if I had a choice.</li><li>Their min. was 2 orders which i found kind of stupid because i definitely wanted to try other things as well but did n't want too much food.</li><li>Overall: The food was okay, not worth it though for the price we paid.</li><li>As for the food, GOOD, but nothing to write home about, ya know ?</li><li>Decently good food.</li><li>You can get it non spicey which was good for people who did n't like their food hot.</li><li>Service could be a bit quicker as we waited a good 20 minutes for our food to come.</li><li>I 'd drop in again, they were nice, and the food was good, and cheap.</li><li>The taste of the food is just okay, nothing special that makes me wanna return to the restaurant.</li><li>The food was good, although it was n't quick since they cook it in front of you ( well, not really, there seemed to be a dining table that was dedicated to cooking it in the dining area).</li><li>The food.</li><li>One thing that was pretty disappointing was the wait time for our food.</li><li>It took forever for our food to arrive.</li><li>Came in super hungry and thought we did n't order enough food and was thinking of getting a side of kimchi rice but good thing we did n't because the 2 orders of spicy dakgalbee was enough!</li><li>Wo n't return again, the portion is not what the picture looks like, and it takes more than 40 mins to get the food right on the table even when there 's only few customers in the store.</li><li>This place is not the cleanest place though but the good food makes up for it.</li><li>The food was fantastic, the service could have been better.</li><li>Food was good but not special.</li><li>I saw images and I was excited to try it out from all the food reviews but it really just tasted like I had imagined.</li><li>We did n't get our appetizers until we asked them ( 30 minutes after we ordered) and it took about 40 minutes for us to get our food ... the place was n't even packed!</li><li>This let you get the food to the level of `` crispiness'' you desire.</li><li>Hearty comfort food for me! n the mash potato side dish is so yummy too! towards the end when u only have a bit of chicken n pieces of veggies left in ur pan, you can ask them to make fried rice with it. they will bring over rice, hot sauce/sesame oil mixture n mix it all up for u. the owner lady even formed the rice into a heart shape for me n my boyfriend one time. it was too cute ~! the Dak Gal Bee is so good there, every time we go that 's all we get. so i do n't know how the other items on the menu taste. oh and the minimum order for Dak Gal Bee is 2 people portions. service is fine, waitresses are pleasant, but sometimes do n't speak much English, but who cares, food 's good!</li><li>The meh 's: The food was pretty decent, but nothing to write home about.</li><li>At a lot of Korean restaurants where you do your own table top cooking, or share an entree, especially those that say they 're for two people, there 's usually a lot of food ( like enough to feed 3 hungry people or 4 average/small eaters).</li><li>Food is good but you need to add to order the additional toppings to make it really good.</li><li>The table top experience was interesting, they place a pile of raw food in a pan on a cooker and come by occasionally to stir it for you.</li><li>The taste of the food was at least 3 stars, it loses a star because of the small portions ( no one should leave a restaurant hungry), and because I literally had to wash all my clothes the next day to get rid of the heavy onion smell ( likely from all the cooking around you).</li><li>The owner there is trying to cut down food cost so much that the quality of meat and vegetables that are used here is horrible.</li><li>Galleria has much more authentic korean food and the price is less then half of Joon 's.</li><li>Nonetheless, it is pretty good food.</li><li>It took 10 minutes to get a menu, another 10 minutes to finally get a hold of someone to take our order and another 20 minutes to get our food.</li><li>There were so many flies &amp; fruitflies landing in our food.</li><li>Joon 's Special is the Dak Gal Bee ( a table-top burner with a large wok that cooks raw ingredients together) The cool thing about it is that unlike western restaurants, the food was cooked right at our table by our waitress instead of being served already cooked.</li><li>As my partner and I talked, the waitress prepared our food in less than fifteen minute!</li><li>The food is just so so.</li><li>The food itself was not bad, but not the best I 've had.</li><li>The food was delicious, I recommend the tom yum broth!</li><li>The only complaint is that some of our food was not brought out, this may be due to the Chinese on the fill out sheet not corresponding with the menu or a mistake on our parts but the staff were very friendly to quickly bring us anything they or we missed out on.</li><li>Great food, great service.</li><li>The food itself was pretty good; the ingredients were fresh and they were n't stingy with them either.</li><li>I liked the food and experience more than the little sheep.</li><li>They function in the same way many other All You Can Eat ( AYCE) places do: you write down on the piece of paper what you want and they bring you your food.</li><li>They also have regular order-type food, but we did n't have that.</li><li>Most of the food we had tasted fresh and, with the strange assortment of food I usually eat at hotpot, this place was pretty good.</li><li>Most of the food we had tasted fresh and, with the strange assortment of food I usually eat at hotpot, this place was pretty good.</li><li>Good variety of food.</li><li>Food is fresh.</li><li>There 's a variety of food and also a variety of ingredients to make your sauce.</li><li>+ Good service and food comes quick.</li><li>To top it off, the food is very reasonably priced.</li><li>TL; DR: Great food, fantastic service.</li><li>It is a complete rip-off and food is very mediocre.</li><li>Quality of the food is good.</li><li>We have tried two other restaurants here and were n't satisfied with the quality of the food or the value.</li><li>Cold food and then later that night i had tummy trouble! so i would not go back at all!</li><li>The price was just under $ 17, food tasted decently great, the portion is a lot!</li><li>And maybe get less food next time because I was definitely full.</li><li>Food Quality &amp; Price: Decent sushi ( not the best) but for the price, you ca n't go wrong.</li><li>This place has huge rolls and it 's definitely enough food.</li><li>The Sushi Bong Special is amazing, so much food for that price ... definitely a great deal!</li><li>The food was ok, their rolls are huge! the food is very much affordable.</li><li>The food was ok, their rolls are huge! the food is very much affordable.</li><li>I mean I 've never been sick from the food here but have never expected much except large portions.</li><li>The whole idea of a take-out service is that you save time and get your food in time when you come in instead of waiting in line ?</li><li>On food quality wise, it is just a decent ( there are worse/ better joints).</li><li>Been coming here for about 10 years now and food quality is the same as day one of not better!</li><li>The place is small and not have room to sit all the time, but food is great price is more than reasonable and staff are friendly.</li><li>Came for takeout at 10:30, and once we paid for our food, they made us wait outside in the cold to clean up.</li><li>Even though there were still customers inside sitting down, enjoying their food.</li><li>The portion size is super big and you get more food than you pay for.</li><li>We did n't need to wait long for our food.</li><li>Not sure if the owner tony is still there because the food seems different.</li><li>But I know that Tony used to check his food well ..</li><li>Well you get what you paid for: cheap price, fast food and mediocre quality.</li><li>The service is quick and the food is decent with good sized portions.</li><li>We placed our order to the server and I swear five minutes after, we got our food!</li><li>The workers here are always eating when preparing your food ...</li><li>The food is prepared quickly, neatly, nicely, and the staff is friendly.</li><li>For take out it is excellent value and decent food.</li><li>That being said, the speed and price certainly show in the quality of the food- everything was just kind of `` meh''.</li><li>It is not professional to yell in front of customers at your employee ( for literally not doing anything) if you 're planning on getting the dynamite roll, do n't bring your girlfriend because the thing is just massive and makes a mess but also amazing The food is amazing but the employees deserve to be treated the way employees are legally treated in Canada, not abused.</li><li>I would skip the Sashimi as I believe raw food should be eaten as fresh as possible but if people insist it 's the quality of an AYCE sushi restaurant like KAKA for a pretty decent price.</li><li>You are getting good food for a good price.</li><li>I m buying food but not begging food from you.</li><li>They prepare the food very quick and it 's delicious !!!</li><li>A must have is the sushi bong special at 10.75 $ tax in a bit of every thing and much healthier then fast food for about the same price.</li><li>Makes pick up much easier Ps do n't park right infront of the place, I got a 250 $ parking ticket there once while waiting for my food, and I was leaning on my car, the owner told me how they have got over 11 of those tickets.</li><li>The food came fast, and if I recall I ordered the dragon roll and dynamite, they were large but they did not hold together well, as were tasteless compared to other sushi places, but I only tried the two.</li><li>But yesterday after eat from them I got food poisoned.</li><li>Yet, within 5 minutes after we ordered ( to sit in), they had our food ready.</li><li>Finally, when she calls for our order, I stick my hand out to receive our food but instead of handing it to me like a decent human being.</li><li>Other than that, service was great, food was filling and worth the price.</li><li>Totally not being a sushi fan and not knowing good sushi from bad, I did not mind the food but even I was able to tell the difference in quality between here and other better places I have eaten recently.</li><li>The only bonus is the cheap price but the food quality is poor.</li><li>The service is n't that great but the food overlooks it.</li><li>It was around a 10mins wait for the food.</li><li>When we got our food, I was so suprised by the size of the rolls !!</li><li>The service is friendly, food is delicious with huge portions, and the price is great.</li><li>The food is good and popular with people in North York.</li><li>Everything tasted fresh &amp; I got my food in less than 2 minutes after paying.</li><li>First things first, the food was good.</li><li>This is your answer Hand made and pulled noodles with a wide variety of options to serve all tasted Pretty much every bowl is under ten bucks so not a tough decision to make However there is only seating for 14 customers so it 's a bit of a bolt hole but worth the wait to grab a seat Great service and great food My dish had wide flat noodles and had the right amount of chew to them and it 's a huge portion All ingredients were fresh and it felt odd I was the only gaijin in the place where the waitress kept trying to explain to me how to eat ..... no I know chopsticks yeah h-mart yes noodles .... hahaha.</li><li>Excellent and unique food, savory noodles, excellent ambiance.</li><li>But the food is too rich that i dont need to come here often haha.</li><li>Food is disgusting.</li><li>The food is very interesting as there are not as much Northern Chinese cuisine other than dumpling houses in Toronto.</li><li>The food is tasty, flavourful and authentic.</li><li>Remind me of the food I had in Beijing.</li><li>The food was decent but no surprises.</li><li>The food was really good only thing was the pork bun was a little oily but had great taste.</li><li>We waited quite sometime for the food to come.</li><li>Although we waited a while for it, the food is delicious.</li><li>The food portion is good.</li><li>I think this is the first Chinese noodle spot I 've been to that mixes the Western/hipster deco feel with this kind of food while blasting old 90 's-current hip hop.</li><li>And what 's `` this food'' ?</li><li>I travel for to China mainly for work very often and I can actually say the food and atmosphere here reminds me deeply of the hip, delicious food stalls in China.</li><li>I travel for to

this place is #puregarbage, everything is either mad sour or salty for no reason at all.</li><li>I 'm pretty sure it 's common sense that when food is sent back to the kitchen untouched, it means that the kitchen fucked up on that particular dish n y should we pay for sth we did n't even touch at all. #artisannoodle #老碗 #chinesefood #northyork #badservice #shittyfood.</li><li>Food is good and so is the service.</li><li>The food was very authentic and yummy, and I 'm already planning to go back with friends again soon!</li><li>Anyways, I had the food as takeout and I must say that I really enjoyed the biang biang noodles.</li><li>Overall the food I 'd give a 3 star but coupled with service i have you give a one star.</li><li>The food portion was good, but some food were too salty.</li><li>The food portion was good, but some food were too salty.</li><li>The food came fairly fast.</li><li>Overall, small place that serves super oily food.</li><li>Overall: This is a very small restaurant, and while it does not match what you 'd get in Xi' an, the food still tastes pretty good and comes in decent portions.</li><li>As a simple palette possessing college student it takes great effort ( or lack of) to induce one to take their food experience to the message boards of yelp.</li><li>The atmosphere of the restaurant seemed rather lively and upbeat with many popular 90 's hip hop songs to keep your mind elsewhere as you wait for your food.</li><li>I live 5 minutes from this place so it 's not a long time from getting the food to getting home.</li><li>The food looks amazing, but does not taste even close to the real deals.</li><li>Waiting time for food is DISGUSTINGLY long.</li><li>However, the food takes sooo long to come out that I ca n't see how this place makes any money.</li><li>I was ready to walk out on this restaurant but my sister apparently likes it so she went to talk to the waitress again asking where our food was.</li><li>By now, it is 12:30 and I am hungry and have been waiting for my food ( appetizers) for 45 minutes.</li><li>The waitress tells my sister that the food will come out in about 5 minutes.</li><li>I would say this place along with its atmosphere has my kind of comfort food ~ Before leaving, be sure to also order a Pork Jia-Mo bun to have for breakfast next day!</li><li>Still worth a visit for the excellent food.</li><li>Most dishes were spicy and quite oily but that 's comfort food for ya.</li><li>I ordered the Bian Bian noodle and it took 30 minutes for the food to arrive.</li><li>Overall the food is just average by service is n't that great.</li><li>It is a very close replica to some of the delicious food that I had when I travelled to China.</li><li>The food is very consistent.</li><li>The food is wonderfully flavourful and fresh.</li><li>I thought the food was really good.</li><li>However, the food took more than 30 mins to come ( but rest of the people in the restaurant got their orders, even the ones that ordered after us).</li><li>Food is good, many varieties to choose from.</li><li>However, the ordered was filled in 15 minutes and we were on our way back home to try the food.</li><li>The food and service were both good.</li><li>Small place but great food.</li><li>The food quality is great as well as the service!</li><li>The egg pancake was bland though other than that they have good food.</li><li>Watch out though because their food has quite a bit of garlic. ask them to go lite on the garlic if that 's not your thing.</li><li>For average food it 's on the pricy side.</li><li>Overall quality of the food is consistent and good.</li><li>The food here is flavourful and they can customize it to your needs.</li><li>Asian Legend has a nice selection of food.</li><li>Their food is very good and tasty and always good portions.</li><li>They are friendly and their food is very authentic.</li><li>OVERALL Good food, good enough to say that I would try their dinner menu soon.</li><li>The food was alright but the service was absolutely horrible.</li><li>Took awhile for food to arrive in random order.</li><li>Yes, their food is on the greasy side.</li><li>I especially love the dimsum-esque food they have, but their vegetable dishes are also pretty good.</li><li>I did n't find any hair or bugs in my food thats always a blessing.</li><li>The restaurant looked really nice, but the food seemed really salty.</li><li>The food here was incredible, full stop.</li><li>The food will come in random order ( I got my main course before my soup dumplings) and no one is going to come back and check to see how your food is.</li><li>The food will come in random order ( I got my main course before my soup dumplings) and no one is going to come back and check to see how your food is.</li><li>And you wo n't be sorry you visited, because really--fantastic food.</li><li>Anyways, as per usual, we ordered a lot of food.</li><li>I think I 'd prefer other locations, b/c this one is semi-inconvenient, but the food is pretty much the same at each location, so you ca n't go wrong.</li><li>I was kinda skeptical with this branch of Asian Legend because over the last few years, every restaurant to set up shop at this location has failed or was simply not good however AL has met my needs for Shanghai type food in my area.</li><li>Overall all of the food was good and very tasty.</li><li>I had so much Chinese food while in Toronto that all my memories of the food are starting to blend together.</li><li>That being said most of the food I had here, albeit on the greasy side, was all tender and tasty.</li><li>I 'd come again for the food, but only if there were n't a long wait.</li><li>The food is highly overpriced.</li><li>The service is horrible and the food is even worse.</li><li>I really like the food here, but compared to the one at Ravel, it 's not quite as excellent.</li><li>Food is always delicious-I always order the general tao chicken, spicy wonton soup, and the chicken dumplings.</li><li>The prices of each dish is reasonable with generous portions and there is consistent food quality across the chain.</li><li>An hour passes and no food.</li><li>When we finally got his attention, he went in search of our food.</li><li>The food here is delicious.</li><li>The service is very good and the food also.</li><li>The service is great and the quality of food is unbelievable.</li><li>I 'm also a little tired of people ' checking' to see if I want food when I 'm at the cash- yes I 'm very sure that I do n't want food, otherwise I would have asked for it.</li><li>Their food is mediocre at best, although, they do have a newly constructed patio that I actually enjoy going to when it 's hot outside.</li><li>I know it 's not the kitchen 's fault, because every time my food gets brought to me, it 's already semi-cold.</li><li>The food takes forever to arrive and it seems like it 's always one old Asian man serving the entire restaurant.</li><li>Every time, they tend to forget something ... e.g., sauce, straw, napkins, etc. by the time you get the sauce ( if you are lucky), your food is literally borderline frozen.</li><li>I do n't actually like the food here, but I 've been emotionally scarred for life.</li><li>I do n't need the aggravation over borderline mediocre food.</li><li>New design Same old tasteless food Service is weak but it matches the quality of the food.</li><li>New design Same old tasteless food Service is weak but it matches the quality of the

higher for much lower quality food.</li><li>Now, the food has gone down hill drastically, prices are considerably higher for much lower quality food.</li><li>I knew i was going to get bad food but even at $ 17.99 it was insulting.</li><li>Always good food and service at pickle barrel Leslie.</li><li>Terrible food.</li><li>Food is good.</li><li>They also ran out of food items too.</li><li>Since this is a neighborhood restaurant, we have eaten there often, but the last 3 times the service was poor and the food so so.</li><li>The only reason I come is that the food is `` reasonably'' -priced and they have some healthy options but the general quality of service and food is sub par.</li><li>The only reason I come is that the food is `` reasonably'' -priced and they have some healthy options but the general quality of service and food is sub par.</li><li>Was quite disappointed with their food.</li><li>I do believe the scrambled eggs I had at MacDonalds was noticeably better since they had improved their food.</li><li>The food here is decent, but really, not that memorable.</li><li>The food plenty and warm as it 's always been.</li><li>I also asked the manager to look into the spoiled food issue and he said ok.</li><li>They should have a food safety inspection before somebody gets violently ill. I only gave this restaurant 1 star because it was mandatory to post this review.</li><li>I give it 1 star for the so-so food.</li><li>Food is n't the best, sometimes does n't taste very fresh.</li><li>When I came here the first few times with friends and family, I had thought that maybe we were just unlucky for bad service and food.</li><li>She asked ' was the service not good', and we said yes the service was not good, they took forever to take our order, the food came cold, they do n't come and check if everything is ok after they bring their food.</li><li>She asked ' was the service not good', and we said yes the service was not good, they took forever to take our order, the food came cold, they do n't come and check if everything is ok after they bring their food.</li><li>Sometimes they forget to bring your food, if you have 5 people, most likely 4 people will get the food if they 're lucky.</li><li>The staff are young and helpful, and the food is just as good as ever.</li><li>We expected our food to arrive around 7:00pm.</li><li>We called the restaurant to check on the status of our order at 7:00pm, and they notified us that the driver had picked up the food and was on his way.</li><li>We called again at 7:30pm to follow up on the status of the order, and they once again assured us that the food was on its way.</li><li>At 7:55pm, we still had not received our food and called again.</li><li>We were especially concerned that our food was prepared before 7:00pm and would be cold by the time it was delivered.</li><li>We would not have ordered from Pickle Barrel if we had known it would take 2 and a half hours to get our food, or even if we had known that our food would sit in the delivery person 's car for over an hour after it was cooked.</li><li>We would not have ordered from Pickle Barrel if we had known it would take 2 and a half hours to get our food, or even if we had known that our food would sit in the delivery person 's car for over an hour after it was cooked.</li><li>I thought the food would be plentiful &amp; good.</li><li>I do n't mind paying for the family if the food is well portioned and prepared.</li><li>Your food is served to you like you are at an army canteen, and the food itself is overcooked and is cold when you get it.</li><li>Your food is served to you like you are at an army canteen, and the food itself is overcooked and is cold when you get it.</li><li>As for the food, decent but nothing spectacular.</li><li>I 've been going to this location for over 10 years now and while it started out excellent both the food and service have declined dramatically over the last few years.</li><li>So, to end on a hopeful note, while they have been a bit disappointing lately, I know I 'll keep going because they have a great selection of food.</li><li>Okay fine, the decor is as atrocious as everybody says, but I see no reason to dock stars when the food is so very excellent.</li><li>The interior is dated and starting to show its age, but the food is great especially the Peking Duck dish!</li><li>But the food was good &amp; plentiful.</li><li>Prices were cheap for the amount of food you get.</li><li>Pros:- lots of parking- big portions- deilicious food- good for big groups, spacious Cons:- ugly decor- must specify no MSG- distracted waitstaff- washrooms cold &amp; need updating but clean.</li><li>The food was great overall and I would rate it 4 stars.</li><li>The food was fine, nothing spectacular.</li><li>The food is not impressive. the duck is supposed to be their specialty however it is bland when compared to other restaurants.</li><li>Food was not bad.</li><li>We reserved a table and while the place looked like it was stuck in another era, we did n't mind as long as the food is good.</li><li>I have been here quite a few times now, the food is reasonably good, the service if you dine in can be fairly slow and the atmosphere of the restaurant is n't t as relaxing as it could be due to the decor, like walking into a 70 's movie ..</li><li>My fave food was the pork belly and Peking duck.</li><li>I get that duck and lobster can be pricey but for the overall quality of the food it felt like a total rip-off.</li><li>I would say the quality of the food was on par with The Mandarin.</li><li>No intention to return though as there are many other Chinese restaurants that offer better value and better food.</li><li>I will always love this restaurant as a place of my childhood, but the food is great too.</li><li>But with the food and service as such, I 'd take my family out to better Chinese restaurants in town.</li><li>If you 're looking for a relatively cheap food that tastes amazing, this is it!</li><li>On to the food!</li><li>I think the food is fine although not five star level.</li><li>Service was decent, the food was a little bland.</li><li>If you are looking for a place for the family to go to for a dinner out with decent food at reasonable prices, this would be a good choice.</li><li>Though the food has not changed in quality over the years, neither has the furnishings and decor.</li><li>The food was promptly served and was delicious.</li><li>Unlike the decor, the food is ' updated' and their lunch special are delicious.</li><li>The duck was good and food itself was fine.</li><li>Most of the food is okay though.</li><li>Apparently MSG is a secret weapon, and you have to specify they not use it if you do n't want it in your food ( that 's what it says on the takeout menu).</li><li>Being practically the only Chinese restaurant within a couple miles radius, management probably lack the incentive to improve on the quality of their food, never mind the decor.</li><li>We ordered one of the set dinners for six people and it took forever for the food to arrive.</li><li>Ultimately, the food is n't anything to write home about.</li><li>Overall, the food is great and good value, seating is reasonably comfy and spacious so it gets 4 stars.</li><li>The price is pretty cheap, considering the amount of food and quality.</li><li>I did n't give One star just because of the food, it 's the whole combination, the decor, service etc ...</li><li>We only ate about 1/3 of the food.</li><li>FYI: BBQ duck $ 43 ( $ 36: sliced duck with crepes $ 7: stir fried duck with lettuce) I felt really bad for my friends because I 've been here before with my in laws and it was pretty good back then ( a year ago .. i think) prompt service and excellent food.</li><li>Ya the decor has n't changed, dusty x- mas lights, mix matched wall papers, I did n't mind at all since the food was great! and with awesome service !!</li><li>The restaurant was the ugliest decor I have ever seen, the bathrooms were utterly filthy and the food cold and very unappetizing.</li><li>The owner explained that they pour water in before serving because the plate is sometimes too hot and it will burn the food.</li><li>What 's the point of a cook/chef to perfectly season my food when a server is gonna pour water over it ?</li><li>Overall, that was a very disappointing experience and I was literally so pissed at this place- for the food and the service.</li><li>I seriously have better food and better service for a lower price at Manchu wok.</li><li>Anyone who gave this place more than one star is definitely deprived of good food!</li><li>Despite the fact this place has n't been renovated in over 20 years ( I 've been coming here for that long, since I was a very young child), the food here is always good.</li><li>The service is n't always great, but the food does make up for it.</li><li>The food was pretty good.</li><li>The food was okay.</li><li>So, long and the short of it, fantastic food, brutal everything else.</li><li>The food is actually quite good, and they have dim sum on the weekends.</li><li>The decor is dated but the food here is good.</li><li>Food was OK but I was expecting a bit more from the portions.</li><li>Only down fall was the server took down a wrong order and they made the food.</li><li>But i was there for the food, so that didnt bother me much As for the wait, the lady told us there will be a $ 20min wait for the peking duck which was reasonable bcuz atleast you know they are serving you freshly roasted ducks.</li><li>Yes, the food speaks for itself but unfortunately the food had nothing to say here so the pink walls do n't help.</li><li>It 's always nice to actually see how your food is being made.</li><li>Consistency in service and food quality is key to a successful business.</li><li>( I cannot comment on their pizzas because I 've never had them) It loses 1 star for 2 reasons, they are slightly overpriced ( 11 for a piadina) but I am willing to overlook it and pay for delicious quality food.</li><li>Great food.</li><li>Food tasted excellent.</li><li>We 'll definitely be back to try more from their menu. truly enjoy the food in this place. unfortunately i had one bad experience, after having a portobello mushroom and goat cheese sandwich and was violently ill for 2 days.</li><li>You also can see the chefs making your food which is a plus.</li><li>We ordered and paid at the cash and the food was delivered to the table.</li><li>Excellent excellent food.</li><li>Atmosphere is quite stylish and comfortable, but where this place shines is the food.</li><li>I went to this place on the weekend, the staff is friendly and the food is good.</li><li>Food is great, but service leaves much to be desired for the cost.</li><li>They do bring your food to your table after a few minutes which is normal, yet when we asked for our dessert we were told to go back to the bar and inform them.</li><li>It 's too bad this place ca n't find a rhythm, the food is incredible but the overall rushed feeling combined with delayed service is not worth the price.</li><li>The food is excellent- as another poster said, it is restaurant quality for a more affordable price.</li><li>I really liked this place- awesome service, modern decor and yummy food.</li><li>The price is a bit steep for a panera bread style Italian eat even with the extremely tasty food and friendly service. certainly not worth the dozens of toilet trips.</li><li>Top-notch restaurant quality food but with a casual feel.</li><li>You order at the cashier and they bring the food to your table or you can get it to go.</li><li>Still, good food and good value!</li><li>Most super delicious food.</li><li>The concept of this place is like Famoso- you go in, place your order at the counter, pay, then take a seat and your food will be served to you.</li><li>I like this place, the food is good.</li><li>The food is tasty, but it 's not the most `` bang for your buck'' option.</li><li>Prices are too high, but the food is very good.</li><li>The number is brought to the table and the servers will bring you the food.</li><li>The food was ok.</li><li>It 's nice to get your food quickly, but this was McDonald 's fast.</li><li>When anything is served that quickly at a dine-in restaurant, it makes me very uncomfortable about the quality of the food.</li><li>The bread that they serve with the food is DISGUSTING.</li><li>In total with a cappuccino my bill was $ 20.35 which for me is steep for the service and amount of food.</li><li>The food is then brought to you.</li><li>The food was excellent!</li><li>Must be how the food order went through as soon as we walked away.</li><li>Also, typical servers check the food with a ' two-bite rule' however this system places the responsibility on the consumer.</li><li>Great food with socially-conscious management, super stylish, more of a quick, filling meal than the typical sit-down.</li><li>Food was to die for.</li><li>For food we both ordered two types of pizza; Pollo al pesto and their Casaglina, along with two glasses of red wine.</li><li>What I liked most about this place, aside from the food was the open concept!</li><li>You order and pay first and then you go sit down and wait for your food to come.</li><li>Good service, good food.</li><li>Great people, great food, great prices.</li><li>The low number of stars is regarding customer service, not the quality of food.</li><li>We 've been to Via Cibo a number of times and have enjoyed the food each time.</li><li>You go up to the counter and order your food from an extensive menu and get a number for your table.</li><li>Shortly after a server arrives with your food.</li><li>The food is reasonably good- we as a family of three had the Tuscan fries, a pesto pasta, margarita pizza and a piadina sandwich with Portobello and goat cheese.</li><li>Good not great for overall food on the menu.</li><li>Via Cibo is like gourmet fast food.</li><li>The food comes out quick but it actually tastes good and is a lot healthier than your McDonald 's/Wendy 's/Burger King, etc.</li><li>You can see how they cook the food.</li><li>Food is decent, nothing worth writing home about Both had different pasta dishes both 2/5 I am guessing the sandwiches and pizzas are probably better so I suggest opting for those of you happen to choose this place Set up and workers are nice but forgettable food make this one I would not suggest to anyone whatsoever Disclaimer: I live in Woodbridge and am probably a little tougher on Italian restaurants due to the wealth of great options in my area.</li><li>So basically you enter the restaurant by entry gate ( separate from exit gate), order your food from the menu on the wall or booklet, then pay for it, you get a number and you get seated.</li><li>Pretty good food, poor unattentive service.</li><li>Service is fantastic, and the food is consistently good ( and reasonably priced).</li><li>The food is amazing &amp; delicious.</li><li>Despite a few mishaps, the food and portions were good.</li><li>Affordably priced mid-range fast food Italian food place that makes homemade pasta and pizzas.</li><li>This restaurant is the classic case of having the right food but failing at management &amp; operations.</li><li>Restaurant: Oh Geul Bo Geul Cuisine: Korean Location: North York Address: 5320 Yonge St Price Range: $ 10 ~ 1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent Food: 4 Service: 3.5 Ambiance: 3 Overall: 3.5 Extra information:* Open late* Patio in the back for Korean BBQ* Serves lunch &amp; dinner Oh Geul Bo Geul is a Korean restaurant that is somewhat hard to notice even with their bright yellow store front sign.</li><li>Ordered: Porkbelly BBQ ( Sam Kyup Sal)* Pork belly BBQ served with mushrooms, onions and veggies for wrapping* You cook this on a BBQ grill at your table* Served with green onions and you can add it to your ' ssam' Green onions with chili powder and some vinegar for you to eat with the grilled meat Ordered: Marinated Beef ( Ju Mul Luk)* Beef mixed with veggies in a sweet sauce* I much prefer this over Bulgogi which I find it to be too sweet* This you also cook at your table with the grill Ordered: Kimchi Stew ( KimChi JjiGae)* It was interesting to see vermicelli in a Kimchi stew* The soup was just spicy enough and not too sour* Usually you eat this with a bowl of rice Ordered: Dumplings ( Mandoo)* These were Mul-Mandoo which means it is cooked in boiling water* You dip this into soy sauce Ordered: Spicy Soup ( Jjam Ppong Tang)* This is usually a noodle dish but this specific one was made without for drinking* It makes a nice dish to order when you are drinking soju* Filled with seafood and veggies Ordered: Seafood Pancake ( Hae Mul Pa Jeon)* There was n't much seafood in the pancake* I did n't really enjoy this Ordered: Spicy octopus &amp; pork* This is a table top cooking with veggies, octopus and pork* You can adjust the spiciness of this dish* Usually comes in 2 portions but we added an extra serving* Because there was so much food it did take a while to cook Conclusion: Now that I 've been back 3 times and tried couple things off their menu, I am convinced that even from their never-ending menu- they serve good Korean food.</li><li>One of my favourite places to enjoy Korean hotpot .. fantastic food, reasonable prices and HUGE portions.</li><li>Awesome awesome food.</li><li>Really, I had to resist the urge to confront her over such a petty thing and inform her that tipping is in fact NOT MANDATORY and the money is supposed to go to the SERVERS, as well as tipping is usually dependent on the SATISFACTION of service and food.</li><li>Yes, the servers are nice, but the owner is a person of poor character and the food frankly, is not all that delicious and not worth it.</li><li>Food is subpar and some items can be ridiculously expensive ( pork bulgogi for $ 17 ? it 's not even beef!).</li><li>That 's a lot to pay for on top of subpar food that can get expensive.</li><li>The food is aweful.</li><li>Verdict: great food, LOTS of side dishes, reasonably priced, servers were nice I went at kind of an awkward time of day so it was pretty quiet.</li><li>It 's a great bang for your bucks and the food was fantastic.</li><li>All the food were very tasty.</li><li>Amazing food.</li><li>Kind of on the cheaper side of things, but the food has always been delicious.</li><li>I still like their food, till last Friday, the rice I got looks like left over rice from the morning.</li><li>The staff was very nice and the food was amazing!</li><li>I have been here many times but it 's a gamble each time whether or not I will receive good service and decent food.</li><li>The food is at best average.</li><li>The food was decent though!</li><li>The food was mediocre, somewhat bland in my opinion.</li><li>That said, the food was fine, the atmosphere was smoky.</li><li>The service and food here is inconsistent, but I am a sucker for their pancakes and banchans- particularly their kimchi cumcumbers, seaweed salad, chap chae noodles, and soy beans.</li><li>It took while for our food to come but with our banchans, we had enough to tame our empty stomachs.</li><li>Good food.</li><li>The food is decent, the service is decent, parking is considered good for Yonge st. Overall acceptable.</li><li>It 's no fancy date spot, but if you want tons of good food at an extremely reasonable price, this is the place to go.</li><li>The food was just okay.</li><li>Food deserve better ratings, but service is terrible.</li><li>Instead I just stared at the food .......</li><li>Other than that, the food is good.</li><li>Cheap good food, with good mix of Korean food.</li><li>They do n't offer any vegetarian dishes, as it may come in contact with their plethora of meats and fish, but their food is incredibly tasty.</li><li>However, I definitely recommend coming here at least once, if not for the food, then for the cheery, relaxed atmosphere.</li><li>I did not have issues enjoying my food.</li><li>Their prices keep rising, and their food quality keeps declining.</li><li>The service has ALWAYS been bad ... like, you feel you 're inconveniencing them when trying to get your order in or to ask for the bill- bad ... but it was tolerable back when the food was pretty good, for a reasonable price.</li><li>Food was so-so, panchan not spectacular except for the fresh tofu.</li><li>We got out food quickly, but our stove ( which was being made by the Korean owner outside, by using charcoal, was kind of slow).</li><li>The noodles were a bit chewier than I expected, but overall the food was decent as well as the service.</li><li>Good food at moderate prices.</li><li>It is always waaaaay too much food- even for 5 people.</li><li>The food was fine but the service was terrible, like you would n't believe.</li><li>Good prices, good food.</li><li>The food is pretty decent.</li><li>Come here for the food, but prepare to be buzzing often.</li><li>Great food!</li><li>It 's the food and price that gets me going back time after time!</li><li>The food here is wonderful.</li><li>Love the many side dishes they offer and the food is never a dissapointment!</li><li>The food here is cheap and the taste is slightly above average.</li><li>The staff is very `` cool'', as in really stern and sometimes rushes you to order things but they 're friendly overall. the food served here tastes awful. the place is also pretty much a dump. the service is quite slow.</li><li>When you 're eating delicious food you will forget about everything else.</li><li>I also tried some of my friend 's food.</li><li>Came by for lunch on my last day in toronto and the food is good but service is sparse if not non-existent.</li><li>Overall, good prices for good food in this mini korea town.</li><li>The quality of food is superb tho.</li><li>As we were waiting for other food to come, we finished some of the side dishes and wanted refills, the server was n't too friendly when we asked and told us you can ONLY choose 3 to refill.</li><li>Food was decent, nothing spectacular comparing to other Korean restaurants but the amount of times we had to ask the server for things that they should automatically bring to the table just RUINS the whole meal.</li><li>* Overall, I WOULD NEVER come back, food is average but SERVICE IS TERRIBLE AND STAFF ARE UNFRIENDLY !!</li><li>This place has excellent gamjatang and better service than Nakwon ( which has great food but poor service).</li><li>Besides that I was totally happy with the food.</li><li>They 're just going to give me less food.</li><li>Had I not ordered food, I think the side dishes would have made for a good light dinner.</li><li>Although the food was okay, the service was not and it was absolutely the worst service I 've ever experienced.</li><li>The food is n't particularly good but they have a whole bunch of side dishes.</li><li>A Korean home feel with great food and even better prices.</li><li>Definitely got the money 's worth, and the food quality was pretty good in my opinion.</li><li>The quality and taste of the food does n't set itself apart from the other places but at least it does no wrong.</li><li>The food itself was n't outstanding and some of it was just not enjoyable.</li><li>The food here is very good.</li><li>The food overal was good.</li><li>We had to walk all the way to the back of the restaurant and asked for everything that we needed, table, water, food .... our server wasnt friendly and got some attitudes.</li><li>We wasnt happy so we decided to ask for the bill without finishing our food.</li><li>We ordered the food but they brought just the food.</li><li>We ordered the food but they brought just the food.</li><li>Loud music too so not a good place for intimacy but late night food, sure!</li><li>With so many options in the area with good food and nice service, we will not be back or getting take-out from this restaurant again.</li><li>Delicious food, okay service.</li><li>The food came very quickly, but the staff working there all seemed to be a bit frazzled and inexperienced.</li><li>When this location first opened up, the food was great.</li><li>Very delicious food.</li><li>Too much food for me hahaha the service is good.</li><li>The 4 stars is mainly because the food was incredibly delicious.</li><li>Location, amount compared to the price, quality of the food, service, everything is 5 stars but only reason I chose to give 4 stars is due the fact the food is a bit too salty- with beer = perfect.</li><li>Location, amount compared to the price, quality of the food, service, everything is 5 stars but only reason I chose to give 4 stars is due the fact the food is a bit too salty- with beer = perfect.</li><li>Anyway, despite all the initial troubles, the food was delicious.</li><li>The kind of food you select depends on how much more you pay ( more you pay, more expensive menu obviously).</li><li>Food is great, no doubt.</li><li>Just go for the food or do take out.</li><li>I 'll love to give them 4 stars for the food but because of their lack in service and few other complains, I 'll give them 3.8.</li><li>However, the boneless bbq chicken is decent and they have plenty of appetizers at the beginning to keep you eating while you wait for your food.</li><li>Their food is okay, definitely not the best Pakistani food I 've had.</li><li>It 's overpriced for the quality and amount you get and on top of that the consistency of the amount of food you get is dissapointing.</li><li>The only thing that keeps me coming back is the convinience of the location and the fact that the parkway forest plaza does not offer much variety in food.</li><li>The food came relatively quickly.</li><li>The food is of course halal.</li><li>The food is good but is very expensive considering the portion.</li><li>The food is a little overpriced but it 's nearby so it 's convenient.</li><li>It took almost an hour to prepare my food.</li><li>Bad experience, bad food ... not to mention the fact that what looked like a half eaten kebab made it into my take-out container .... after what happened with the cup I would n't be surprised to know that someone dropped it and snuck it into the wrong container.</li><li>As for the food itself, it was ok.</li><li>There food is actually better than most of the food in North York.</li><li>There food is actually better than most of the food in North York.</li><li>The food is unbelievable.</li><li>The food here tastes better than any other pita pit ive had including the one on campus at york.</li><li>However it was inviting and clean, the gentleman who prepared my food was very friendly and attentive, and the falafel was great ( recommend the green olives, really gives it some extra flavor).</li><li>Very good food and very friendly.</li><li>The food is good but not the best.</li><li>Service is slow and I am left waiting for my food.</li><li>The food was plenty, we ended up having leftover to pack home!</li><li>The staffs here were so nice and joke around with us ... and food was delivered to our table minutes after we ordered ... but we were the only table there ... so I cannot comment on how it would be during busy dinner time!</li><li>The quality of the food here has really deteriorated.</li><li>You 'll sure get high blood pressure after a full dose of high sodium food here.</li><li>The food is passable quality but nothing I would rush to order again- not too greasy or salty.</li><li>All in all the price is right and so is the food ( for the most aprt).</li><li>This food RIGHT HERE is for the truly starving.</li><li>The food is good but there just too rude bad service good food I would go back only for the food and Ima get the hell outta there.</li><li>The food is good but there just too rude bad service good food I would go back only for the food and Ima get the hell outta there.</li><li>The food is good but there just too rude bad service good food I would go back only for the food and Ima get the hell outta there.</li><li>They are cheap but it shows in the quality of the food.</li><li>The food is EXCELLENT and the best in Toronto!</li><li>However, as a Chinese person myself, Sea-Hi 's food is n't very good.</li><li>I 'm sure dine-in is probably nicer, but their food is of lower quality ( probably why it is so cheap).</li><li>The food is ' old school' Chinese food, that is what passed for Chinese food in the old days.</li><li>Not fine dining, but food .....</li><li>The food here is thoroughly mediocre ... meaning it wo n't get you sick, and it tastes good, but there 's absolutely nothing special about it.</li><li>The food served here is thoroughly Jewish/American-Chinese.</li><li>If that 's your thing, you 'll love the food ( as it 's quite good, as far as this style of cuisine is concerned).</li><li>The food was A-OK.</li><li>The price seemed to be a little high, since the food is for the most part deep fried.</li><li>Bad disgusting food.</li><li>I was extremely impressed by the food, and for the price range ( $ 9 per entre), it far exceeded value in my opinion.</li><li>The food was pretty decent but I wo n't be going back to a dishonest place like this.</li><li>Food is ok, owner is Afghani so has little more Afghan style food but all in all its a fast food Shawarma and falafel place, nothing special really.</li><li>Food is ok, owner is Afghani so has little more Afghan style food but all in all its a fast food Shawarma and falafel place, nothing special really.</li><li>The food is good &amp; satisfying.</li><li>He apparently enjoyed his food but mine was horrible.</li><li>I came here a few nights ago with another couple just to have some good food and catch up:) I liked how this place has both savory and sweet crepes for people who want to eat `` dinner'' or `` dessert''.</li><li>Food Quality &amp; Price: Size, portion and prices of crepes and waffles are comparable to Demetres.</li><li>She did n't go above and beyond, but everything from delivering food to transactions was seamless.</li><li>The employees were so nice to assist with parking and also to ensure we had the best quality of food.</li><li>The presentation of the food is beautiful.</li><li>I am going to warn my friends NOT to go here cuz honestly, their customer service was unprofessional and their food was not measurable to a delicious crepe dessert.</li><li>Food is always good.</li><li>Everybody at the counter was too busy making food and never bothered to look up.</li><li>Since I did n't order any food, I am grading this solely based on atmosphere and drinks.</li><li>The staff is attentive, polite, and service and food came fast.</li><li>I believe they also offer sandwiches ( ?) or just entree/appetizers kind of food.</li><li>I recommend going there on weekdays because they have a lunch special: ( savoury or desert crepes with a latte for only around 10.99 + salad) Service is always good, and the food is even better.</li><li>The only thing I have to say was the sauce used to smother the mushrooms were a little on the salty side and mind you, I love salty food but this was a bit more than I can handle!</li><li>Space is limited and a little tight for the average person .. = P We ended up ordering crepes, matcha tea and another special tea that you do n't normally see elsewhere ... we were overall very impressed with the service and food quality ..</li><li>I would 've given the food about a 4 star rating tho the originality, gave it the extra star.</li><li>Ok back to the food.</li><li>Their food is a treat!</li><li>The food is amazing ... new love for black sesame ice cream.</li><li>The food and drinks were great and so was the service.</li><li>Although the store is quite small, the service and food is excellent.</li><li>I really like their food.</li><li>The food at this restaurant/café, located on the first floor of the condo building always looks and taste very nice.</li><li>The fresh and bright atmosphere welcomes you to cheery servers and delicious food:) Pastel has many desserts, including ( if I am not mistaken) Peruvian chocolate mousse.</li><li>Pastel 's interior was very cute and the food came in large portions but so big that I was unable to finish half of it.</li><li>I did n't order any food here so I ca n't comment on the crepes.</li><li>Fresh food, good portion at good price, the goat curry i ordered was actually mostly meat:) and not just bones like some places ..</li><li>It was not overpowering and sometimes it can be salty ... this was very good food.</li><li>Having said that, the food here is good and I am picky.</li><li>Nanalyn 's food is tasty and the young man behind the counter is very courteous.</li><li>Food was good will be back when in the area.</li><li>I would give 0 stars if the application allows for it, avoid this place at all costs, many other pizza joints literally down the road, pizzaiollo and pizza pizza, along others, with way better customer service and food.</li><li>While we were waiting for our food, they asked us to move to the long table.</li><li>The food comes out within 10 minute of ordering and it 's probably as authentic as it can get.</li><li>Being raised by a vietnamese mother, i 've had good, authentic food my entire life, but when she does n't feel like cooking something that I 'm craving or when I want comfort food this place is where I go.</li><li>Service is as expected for an asian place, not very personal, the servers are just focused on bringing you your food and then you eat and you 're out.</li><li>The food is consistently good and the waitresses have all been nice.</li><li>Food is great.</li><li>The food is delicious and they do n't cheap out on the protein portions.</li><li>When you visit the place is packed with Vietnamese families so you know the food is authentic.</li><li>PS REMEMBER TO TRY THEIR ICED COFFEE WITH CONDENSED MILK! +: Food is decent.</li><li>I 'm not going to lie, the food is delicious.</li><li>However, as I was waiting for my food, one of the female employees called me by saying `` hello !!'' as if I was stupid.</li><li>Nothing upscale or fancy about the decor or service, but it 's the food that 's good.</li><li>Food is very good.</li><li>Good food but service leaves something to be desired ....</li><li>My experience with this place was HORRIBLE.- arrived on a late holiday Sunday night pretty desperate for food, staff sweeping the floor with dirt and food residues two hours before closing and half the people still eating.</li><li>We had clearly asked for a new table, and there were empty seats on other half of the restaurant, but waitress plainly said no.- now the food: we were praying that food would be amazing cuz we were so hungry that we would just let go of poor service if food was good.</li><li>We had clearly asked for a new table, and there were empty seats on other half of the restaurant, but waitress plainly said no.- now the food: we were praying that food would be amazing cuz we were so hungry that we would just let go of poor service if food was good.</li><li>We ordered- bun bo hue- special pho- beef and beef ball pho- rice- cha gio- three cafe su da The food was definitely a disappointment.</li><li>The food is fair but I may say!</li><li>If they are going to serve good food they might as well start with good brand for their rice.</li><li>I ca n't stop thinking about the delicious food I had for dinner last night, which prompted me to write my first yelp review.</li><li>Service can be a dud sometimes but it 's a minor setback when it comes with good and cheap food.</li><li>They take orders quickly and food comes quick but service is n't really pleasant.</li><li>Also one of the workers was sweeping the area right beside our table where the broom could disperse all the dust onto our food that has accumulated throughout the entire day.</li><li>It 's one of those places that look slightly sketchy and has little service, but the food is worth the lack of service and decor.</li><li>But I 've been here many times and the food is always good.</li><li>But I recommend you probably stick to the food because that 's what they 're really good at here!</li><li>It is a typical Vietnamese restaurant, nothing fancy nor shiny and new looking but where they lack in decor and polish they more than make up for in quality of food.</li><li>The food is quick, delicious, and plentiful, and that 's more than enough for me.</li><li>The medium pho came first, but we waited a long time for the tendon pho and vermicelli ( a very very long wait, two tables that came after us got their food served before us.</li><li>The food was okay, as many other Vietnamese restaurants in Toronto.</li><li>The food is awesome which is what kept me coming back.</li><li>I knew what to expect in Asian places in Toronto ... you wo n't get good service but most of the time, the food is great.</li><li>Food was quick ... mine not so pretty tho.</li><li>The food is too good so I ignored it.</li><li>The food arrived first.</li><li>Food is good but the place is n't cozy.</li><li>I mostly enjoy good food at an affordable price.</li><li>They would even bring a small bowel with scissors for my little one ( to cut her food into small pieces -- really helpful).</li><li>I may have to go somewhere else where the food is comparable, but the service better ... it really is too bad.</li><li>To be perfectly honest I 've not found that much of a difference between the 4-5 pho places in Toronto in terms of the food.</li><li>I 'd say its decent for how cheap the food is here.</li><li>The food arrived very quickly, all at once, and was perfectly cooked and spiced.</li><li>Besides the occasional line out the door and long waits during peak times, service is quick and the food is great.</li><li>Service from the ladies was meh but whatever, I 'm here for the food.</li><li>I am very disappointed with the food and the customer service of this place.</li><li>All food options ( pho, com, bun) are excellent and flavourful and fast.</li><li>If you come not expecting impeccable service but simple tasty food at a great price you 'll be a happy camper.</li><li>Rule of thumb when it comes to viet food: good if owner is viet, mediocre if owner is chinese-viet, and run away if owner is hongkongnese.</li><li>The food came really fast, was good and well served, but as the place was crowded, they did n't give us any attention.</li><li>I went two more times after my first visit and the quality of food has deteriorated a bit, the pho now tastes ok and also other dishes are ok.</li><li>Food is good but not worth going for because service is terrible.</li><li>If customer service improved, food would be a whole lot better too!:/.</li><li>Their food is standard I 've noticed with other pho restaurants, they were good but not mind blowing.</li><li>The food was good, ehich is why I come here.</li><li>- After getting our food we asked for 2 small bowls and 2 forks.</li><li>The buffet ( which is not all you can eat) is pretty cheap ( around $ 6) Your food is given to you by a server- they will give you a HUGE amount of carbs- usually either plain rice or pasta- I 'm talking two or three cups of rice, and then a smaller amount of protein ( whatever they 've made that day) quality ranges from pretty mediocre to quite good, but it 's pretty much luck of the draw as to what they decided to make that day.</li><li>It 's very evident that the snail tries to keep it 's food costs down to a bare minimum and offer a large amount of ( cheap) food for a low price.</li><li>It 's very evident that the snail tries to keep it 's food costs down to a bare minimum and offer a large amount of ( cheap) food for a low price.</li><li>The owners are usually quite friendly and chatty, but I think overall the food is medicocre and the service is slow.</li><li>The food is affordable and is made to order, no stale fries here.</li><li>My food was delicious and authentic.</li><li>Food was abundant and tasty!</li><li>I could n't finish my food but I wish I could have.</li><li>Food was average.</li><li>Not much healthy food but they have a couple salads which are n't bad ( if you avoid the muffin/cake thing they give you with it).</li><li>Food was actually cold when it got out to us ...</li><li>Pros: + tasty food + fast service Cons:- the menu was warn and unatractive- some of the food came a bit burnt.</li><li>Pros: + tasty food + fast service Cons:- the menu was warn and unatractive- some of the food came a bit burnt.</li><li>We had a nice dinner with the kids The ribs are great and worth the price Side orders are a bit pricy for the size they are serving Overall good food with friendly stuff Worth the price.</li><li>Food was fresh and done the way we liked.</li><li>5 stars because washroom were clean and all supplies were filled, food was correct, all topping we asked for were there when the food arrived.</li><li>The food here is horrible.</li><li>None of the food tasted like it was smoked or made from scratch ... and the prices were pretty inflated for such low quality food.</li><li>At more than $ 30/person, I could have done groceries and come up with much better and tastier food.</li><li>Never go to Montanas if you want your food at any reasonable amount of time.</li><li>Took 2 hours to get our food.</li><li>But the food is good and that 's all that matters.</li><li>The food was okay, but definitely sub par to other Vietnamese restaurants available in the area.</li><li>And the fact that the place is so dead makes me concerned the food ca n't be fresh either.</li><li>The food was 3/5 and ambiance gets 0/5.</li><li>The place does n't have a great ambiance, but the food definitely makes it worth coming here.</li><li>My family and myself have been coming to this spot for years till we moved but we revived the tradition of late and the food is still awesome at this location.</li><li>Panera Bread is better in terms of quality of food.</li><li>You go through, cafeteria style, pay for your food and seat yourself.</li><li>Healthier, more food for your dollar, and a much quieter, friendlier atmosphere.</li><li>This is the best place to eat at Fairview because it 's decent value, the food is fresh, and it 's usually nice and quiet.</li><li>They give you lots of food!</li><li>The food was good but I 'd agree that the appetizers were better than the mains, although I did n't eat many mains because I was full of the early dishes.</li><li>Even though it is fast food, I would n't mind waiting for more than 15 minutes for my dine in order.</li><li>But the food is great for this area.</li><li>They are overpriced and each plate does n't contain enough food either.</li><li>The service has never been particularly good, you have to wait quite a while for the food and the food has never been stellar.</li><li>The service has never been particularly good, you have to wait quite a while for the food and the food has never been stellar.</li><li>The food Marche serves for appetizers and main courses for brunch, lunch and dinner are pretty good too!</li><li>All of the food is great but my huge faves about this place is the desserts and the hot beverages that compliment the sweet treats.</li><li>You arrive and a card is given to you ... you approach a food station with a plate, gesturing for your selection like Oliver Twist .. the Food Barista will punch your card with the appropriate value of the meal hidden in `` code'' At the end of your meal, your `` code'' is calculated and you then pay $ $ $.</li><li>There is a $ 1 charge for each piece of unfinished food, and items like the Edamame beans come in ridiculously large portions.</li><li>Initially we started going there because of it 's close proximity to my parents ' place, but we keep going back because the food never disappoints!</li><li>I often go and order food for takeout, but they are still very hospitable.</li><li>Here are my favourites at this place:- Shrimp Tempura ( HUGE Shrimps with a nice crispy finish)- Red Dragon ( This roll is wrapped up in delicious smoked salmon)- Green Dragon ( a delicious combo of shrimp, crab and veggies wrapped up in fresh green avocado)- Golden California Rolls ( Not as healthy but it is fried to perfection and melts in your mouth)- Chicken Teriyaki bento box ( tons of food!</li><li>The best part, though, is the food!</li><li>Great place, prices are reasonable and the food is consistently high quality.</li><li>But then again, we chose the AYCE option, we already lost our right to complain about having too much rice in our sushi and unappealing food presentation.</li><li>Our food came and we soon started wishing we had n't asked for them as they were just as bad as what we already ate.</li><li>We ate the last bit of food we had and the waitress came and collected all our plates and eating utensils.</li><li>Maybe if you opt for the normal menu the food would be better.</li><li>Even when one of my friends ordered something and while everyone else had their food, the head waitress came by to tell my friend that his food was coming real soon, and it did ( no more than 3 minutes).</li><li>Even when one of my friends ordered something and while everyone else had their food, the head waitress came by to tell my friend that his food was coming real soon, and it did ( no more than 3 minutes).</li><li>The food items for lunch AYCE was pretty decent and it good but nothing that stood out.</li><li>Right after he finished, he reappeared with a couple of plates of my food.</li><li>I would go back for her alone but hey, good news, food is great and reasonably priced too!</li><li>Very disappointed, usually very good service and food from Pizzaiolo, I would avoid this location at all cost.</li><li>I am willing to compromise a bit of quality if the food is good .... but horrible quality and horrible service ... so disappointing P. S- Your time and money means nothing to them.</li><li>It 's small and quiet and quaint and the food is really great.</li><li>The Food was fine.</li><li>I do n't want to knit-pick so let 's move on to the food.</li><li>However, beneath the illusion, you will realize this overpriced restaurant is serving you food you can find elsewhere at a better value.</li><li>Wonderful owners and staff ... really lovely food .. and their spicy edamanme is genius!</li><li>The food was average en par with other Japanese restaurants in the same price range.</li><li>The food for the most part was very good.</li><li>It 's really unfortunate, because the food was quite good.</li><li>The food was average, the quality is similar to sushi you would find at an ayce joint, so if you prefer variety, you might be better off going to one of those joints.</li><li>Overall, the place exceeded my expectations for service and food quality only because of the low reviews the place received.</li><li>While there are a few little things that take away from a 5-star rating, I like to support local, family-owned businesses and the quality of the food here is very good.</li><li>It is a little pricier for a small restaurant but if you want mediocre food for cheap prices go a few blocks west to Sashimi House, the prices there are fantastic but you get what you pay for.</li><li>Pros:- food is fantastic.</li><li>Fresh sushi/sashimi, generous portions, food is always hot.</li><li>The food is a bit more on the salty side as well.</li><li>The service was reasonably good, the food was good.</li><li>The food alone was $ 55 but looking at the regular menu it would have no way added to $ 55.</li><li>The burgers and fries are quite good, by fast food standards.</li><li>The food is well you know, nothing special, same old BK like always ...</li><li>She took our order, gave us our food and that was about it.</li><li>The food was alright.</li><li>I would n't recommend this place for their rolls. convenient location, inside the emptess walk plaza, downstair from the movie theatre. the food is average and service is okay but i find it expensive compared to the quality of the food. but i understand it is due to the location. but i 'd go to other sushi place just a steeet away at sheppard where u have more choice: kiyomizu, ichiban springgarde, sakura, sushi moto, and sushi one. the price is cheaper w better quality bc of the competition.</li><li>The food is mediocre but it took them 45 mins to make spicy salmon roll.</li><li>The food was very clean and fresh.</li><li>Food was lukewarm.</li><li>The food is fresh and delicious every single time.</li><li>Food was n't quite reasonable for the price; not sure if we left a tip or not for the quality of service.</li><li>Cost 2.5/5 ( 10% of final grade) The price range was also at par for the quality and the industry of the food offered.</li><li>Final Grade = 56.5/100 = 3 Stars TLDR: Food was nice, and I would look forward to visiting if I ever forget my lunch again.</li><li>However, the food is average/decent for the prices.</li><li>The food is mediocre.</li><li>Food was okay.</li><li>Certainly not a spot for the budget conscious unless you eat very small amounts of food.</li><li>Service was alright, atmosphere was OK, but what will keep me from coming back here is the sub-par food, the lack of decent portions and the whack prices.</li><li>The young man server knew I ordered udon and even tho my husband got his food first, mine came out 10 mins after and the person who came after me got his food first.</li><li>The young man server knew I ordered udon and even tho my husband got his food first, mine came out 10 mins after and the person who came after me got his food first.</li><li>All food was served fairly fast and was fresh and excellent in taste.</li><li>Once food was served the service was very slow.</li><li>But the quality of food is excellent.</li><li>Other flaws include overpriced average food, slow service, no wifi, and smooth jazz elevator music.</li><li>The pricing here was decent but because the food was n't outstanding, I 'm hesitant to come back.</li><li>I rather walk a couple blocks north or south on Yonge in search for some better food.</li><li>I think the food is okay, although higher priced and much smaller sized compared to the surrounding neighbourhood of japanese and korean restaurants.</li><li>Living so close, I thought I 'd give this place a try, unfortunately the food was a big miss and the price insulting.</li><li>Mediocre food and service.</li><li>The food is edible, but I would not be interested in bringing a business acquaintance here.</li><li>But anyhow, I do wish they did have AYCE but the presentation and the food is always good.</li><li>Just ordered from them for delivery and it took over an hr after they said 45 min and the food is not that good.</li><li>Waitress brought out my food but did n't acknowledged what I ordered.</li><li>To shorten the story my soondubu was so awful had food poisoning the next day.</li><li>Worst Ayce ever the food comes in a bad quality, arrived late, etc.</li><li>My only issue is that I 've had the same experience and quality of food for about $ 5 cheaper!</li><li>Another customer came up to US and translated that that the chief was saying that if we annoy him anymore he will kill us or spit in our food.</li><li>If a place has horrible food and bad service, that 's a one star restaurant in my book.</li><li>With that said, the food here is just bad.</li><li>But most buffets have bad food, especially with a name like Mandarin or Hong Kong or Chinese stuck in it somewhere.</li><li>Like all buffets part of the Mandarin chain, it is clean and offers pretty good food.</li><li>With that said, the food is great, and depending on what day you go, there is always added specials to satisfy your taste buds.</li><li>The food is passable but bland and uninspired.</li><li>Sometimes the food is delicious and others like it died.</li><li>Overall it is one of the better Chinese buffets but if you want great Chinese food I recommend going to a non-buffet restaurant where the food is fresh.</li><li>Avoid any nights or days when Tom is working, usually these nights are not the best for food consistency.</li><li>They also do n't cut up their own meat and get it from a service company the Food Inspection Branch has told me.</li><li>I loved the food when I first got there.</li><li>Food is okay, rice is dry, sushi is subpar.</li><li>The food is not good as I expected.</li><li>Great food.</li><li>As for the food, their sushi portions were HUGE, we ordered the green dragon roll and the spicy volcano roll.</li><li>The quality for the food was worth the price.</li><li>I was n't as impressed with the cooked food- kalbi was quite oily and chicken was just okay.</li><li>This was our third visit to Yuki Restaurant, and we were expecting good food and decent service, which is what we 'd experienced before.</li><li>We mentioned it to the waitress when she asked how everything was and she immediately told us that they only serve fresh fish, and that their food could not possibly be bad.</li><li>We are not expecting stellar service every time, but we do n't appreciate being lied to and wasting our money on food we cannot even eat.</li><li>When you go to this place seems that the house Speciality is Hair in your food, also the manager says !!</li><li>Food was good.</li><li>Customers inconsiderate and rude. the place used to be excellent. i used to come here at least once a week. now the food quality is horrendous. i ordered chicken teriyaki, it smelled like sewage and tasted spoiled. their sushi comes with fish that 's been sitting out for two days. after the last time i ate here i got a stomach ache. i understand trying to save a few bucks, but not at the expense of health!</li><li>Food is fresh and portions are a good value for price.</li><li>So after this situation, the food did n't seem to taste as good as I remembered 20 minutes ago.</li><li>It 's a homey place that serves good food.</li><li>Pros: Has lunch specials and dinner specials, food came out quickly, tempura and japchae was yummy Cons: miso soup was too salty, the waitress sat me in a booth and did n't check up on me once the food came, did n't get a water refill, no banchan or kimchi, skimped on the Kalbi for the lunch special If you 're looking for a place in the area that serves Korean food for the same price, your best bet would be the Seoul house on Orfus Rd. You might said I 'm picky but I do n't think I would come back to this place.</li><li>I think they have good price for sushi/korean food.</li><li>On to the food, it was good.</li><li>Everyone in my party was very impressed by the quality, size and presentation of the food, especially the sushi.</li><li>The food comes out nicely on the plate and the taste is just as delicous.</li><li>I have a shellfish allergy and they 're always very careful with the food, which is important.</li><li>She ends up being the person that made our food.</li><li>And one thing that really disgusted me is how she was on cash and made our food right after without any gloves or washed her hands after she coughed in it and made our food ..</li><li>I usually love their food especially their chicken on the rocks but on my recent visit they gave me really dry chicken and rice.</li><li>The food itself was n't as warm either.</li><li>Ca n't say that I am in love with the franchise version, and was sad to see the generic packaging on their dipping sauce but man do I love their food ...</li><li>Whether it be a St. Louis or Bistro on Avenue, the food is always a hit if you want wings and fries.</li><li>andI have been going since it opened, Its is consistently great. the food is the same each and every time.</li><li>Despite how crappy it looks, it still manages to put out some pretty good food.</li><li>I 've had some pretty subpar service here but at least the food is good.</li><li>However when the food came, i was wrong.</li><li>Before we ordered, an old man nicely handed her the food tray and she tells him to put it in top of the garbage instead.</li><li>Great for take out as the space is not as appetizing as the food.</li><li>Staff are friendly despite them being super busy. amazing breakfast/brunch place, easy access, free parking infront, on sunday before 1pm. great services, food was unbelievable good. huge portion for the price.</li><li>Need a relaxed place to sit, enjoy good food and linger to play catch up.</li><li>Food was pretty good- then again, I love eggs- can eat at any meal of the day.</li><li>This little neighbourhood gem serves classic comfort/brunch food made with a subtle gastronomic flair in an unassuming but cozy little diner featuring the friendliest of owners whose passion it is to please you and your palate.</li><li>It 's a low/key, not fancy diner with excellent service, reasonable prices and delicious food.</li><li>Expensive for an average food.</li><li>The service is always fast and the food is consistently cooked well and served at very large portions.</li><li>Great food and service.</li><li>The breakfast special is priced very well ( especially before 11am for 4.99) however the menu is a but on the pricey side for a diner. the food quality and taste, did however make up for this. its a great little place to pop into for a more gourmet style diner food experience.</li><li>The food was amazing, fresh and pure yum for the stomach.</li><li>One thing that will surprise them: the pedigree means top quality food, regardless of how the table is dressed.</li><li>Food Quality &amp; Price: So much to rave about the Egg 's Natasha which was executed to perfection !!</li><li>Water was refilled without being asked and it was n't an absurd wait time for food.</li><li>Mind you the food was n't bad nor was the service but having read the reviews I was expecting amazing food that would make me want to keep coming back.</li><li>Unfortunately it was n't, the food was okay ( like most diner food), good quantity and good service.</li><li>Dropped in here again but during the day, not a large menu beyond breakfast but the food was still fantastic.</li><li>Friendly service, reasonable value, decent food- wo n't wow you but holds its own.</li><li>Food is great- Hazel 's has your signature brunch options ( eggs, pancakges, hash etc ...).</li><li>Great service, good food, love their bacon, just very pricey on the beverages_ 3 dollar tea, 5 for juice ???</li><li>When you think about a good diner, you anticipate tasty but not too healthy greasy hangover food that likely comes from a kitchen that has n't been updated since the 50s.</li><li>The wait time for the food might be a bit longer than expected, but you can just use that time to bask in one of the better diner atmospheres in the city of Toronto.</li><li>The food is dripping with grease.</li><li>If there was less grease in their food id rate it a 4 for sure.</li><li>Amazing food ordered egg benedictine for me &amp; Bonnies hash for my husband .. both were terrific i gave it 4 out of 5 though excellent service &amp; yummy food cause the place was hot i think the ac was broke.</li><li>Amazing food ordered egg benedictine for me &amp; Bonnies hash for my husband .. both were terrific i gave it 4 out of 5 though excellent service &amp; yummy food cause the place was hot i think the ac was broke.</li><li>The server was good but it took awhile to get our food.</li><li>The prices are a little bit higher than I 'm used to paying, but I found the food to be tasty, creative and with just the right portions.</li><li>Their food is different, homey, and delicious.</li><li>The food was great, I had the Mexican Benny and my wife had the Eggs Benedictine both of which were great.</li><li>At the end of the day I must say the food is good.</li><li>Stellar service and better food.</li><li>Ambiance was nice, service was odd, place was very tight and crowded, food was served luke-warm.</li><li>We did n't have to wait too long for our food either.</li><li>The food is super fresh, hot, delicious in every way!</li><li>For a diner, they have ok food but definitely not worth the price.</li><li>The food came out pretty fast considering how busy they were by the time we ordered.</li><li>Was heading home and wanted setting besides hotel or airport food and searched for somewhere between markham and the airport Parking is street level and at 9am on a Thursday was pretty busy traffic wise but we found a slot out side pretty easy.</li><li>Food was great.</li><li>Came here for breakfast and all I can say is that the service was phenomenal the breakfast came out really fast my coffee cup stayed full, the food was good and the place was packed.</li><li>The food is great, I only tried their breakfast dishes but I 'm.</li><li>The food is great, the service is very friendly though it can get slow when the place is packed.</li><li>Then again, it 's packed because the food is so good.</li><li>Great little place, food was good and prices reasonable.</li><li>Here 's why; My initial 3-star appraisal was based solely my the food, which was average.</li><li>Sooo, what I 'm saying is my food deserved a 3, the decor a 4, so in a perfect Yelp world, 3.5 stars.</li><li>Food is very tasty.</li><li>The food was good though.</li><li>It was our first time trying this place. everything was great. the food, the service was excellent. their fresh orange juice was awesome. it was a bit hot inside the diner but that did n't stop us finishing our food and coffee. thanks again Hazel 's diner.</li><li>It was our first

was up to my standards.</li><li>But food is great.</li><li>Food is good.</li><li>Me and my BF have been going here, and we keep coming back due to the food and service.</li><li>Most recent time, the food was terrible.</li><li>For the food, there is nothing absolutely amazing.</li><li>For the rest of the reviewers: I think a little slap of reality in the face is needed for you guys, because honestly, this place is not really a five star quality restaurant and we all know we 're just paying like chump change for the food their serving.</li><li>Food was fresh but quality was mediocre.</li><li>I would n't recommend this place for its food, it 's probably fair to say I have had better overnight takeout Japanese food ( sans sushi) than this place.</li><li>Nice place, friendly people, good food!</li><li>Recommend to anyone interested in tasting Philippine 's food.</li><li>I thought the food here was quite delicious.</li><li>The food was just right and serving size was more than average.</li><li>It has better price, service, food, and place!</li><li>The food here is OK.</li><li>I found that the prices were not reasonable considering that the food was just fine.</li><li>Mediocre food, expensive price.</li><li>That is n't the tip if u asked me, unless it was mutual! very average food and slow service.</li><li>When we were done, while I was happy with the options, I found the food to be a bit mediocre.</li><li>I 'd give it 4 stars for the effort but 2 for the food.</li><li>I ca n't give zero stars, Food is average just like any other Filipino place, the SERVICE SUCKS !!!!!</li><li>A lot of people think the food and service are horrible but it 's actually not that bad.</li><li>There are a lot of non-Filipino food on their menu but if you 're gonna come here, you might as well try the Filipino food.</li><li>I would definitely like to see more less than $ 10 food in their menu because a lot of these food are actually a bit overpriced.</li><li>I

n't have to wait around for long and the food tastes amazing.</li><li>Great food.</li><li>It 's in a tacky/sketchy mall but that 's OK, it 's worth the trip out there to get such good food at such a low price.</li><li>Shrimp and rice was delicious and fresh crunchy fresh veggies chicken balls were full of white meat and crunchy outside great service and great chinese food for a low price.</li><li>Both are cheap, friendly, and serve solid food.</li><li>No matter- as long as it 's clean and they do n't die in my food, I 'm game to go back for some authentic Korean here anytime. seafood and combo tofu were both delicious, hot and swimming in a gorgeously flavored broth.</li><li>This is the perfect food for winter!</li><li>Note: They are a speciality Soontofu/Soondubu restaurant, which means they serve majorly of Soontufu/Soondubu options and only 1 other food option which is Bibimbap.</li><li>Literally, the food is magical!</li><li>But, the food makes up greatly for it and it 's a friendly atmosphere!</li><li>Lots of quality food for very reasonable price.</li><li>The price is amazing and the food is delicious.</li><li>Due to the lack of variety of their menu ( which I have no complaints about), the food arrives at the table within 5-10 minutes tops.</li><li>This place uses so much salt in their food you will have no idea on taste but I can assure the quality is not good.</li><li>However, the staff are kind, the service is great, and the food is really what you 're there for anyway.</li><li>Now, let 's get down to the food.</li><li>I 'm glad that you can choose how spicy your food can be, since I love spicy food while my girlfriend hates it.</li><li>I 'm glad that you can choose how spicy your food can be, since I love spicy food while my girlfriend hates it.</li><li>I 've definitely been here 100 + times by now -- where else can you find such amazing food for $ 11 including taxes and tips ( used to be $ 9 all-in!) ?</li><li>Oh yeah, and my friend found a piece of the scrubby sponge in her food ... gross.</li><li>The food is mediocre.</li><li>The cost is $ 1/2 higher than other places, but for the amount of food that is given- it 's very worth it.</li><li>It 's one of our favourite joints for quick homey hearty food.</li><li>Tables are placed close to one another, call it `` cozy'' or `` communal'', do n't mind other people staring at your food or sharing their conversations with you, it 's mostly unintended.</li><li>And the food were also very bad as the shrimp and meat were both very cheap quality ingredients I will never come here again knowing there are much better choices in the same area.</li><li>I have been here numerous times and always leave impressed with how flavourful and filling their food is.</li><li>A very small menu but the staff were very nice, the food spicy and very delicious.</li><li>Love the food but the service could use a little work.</li><li>I just want to enjoy my food and not burn my mouth trying to hurry up for you.</li><li>Delicious food, and so cheap! $ 10 including tax and tip will fill you right up.</li><li>After we ordered, the food came within 5 minutes so if you need to food to mouth resuscitation quick, this is a great place to come.</li><li>The food was good but I did n't find it amazing.</li><li>However our food was brought out pretty quickly.</li><li>The food was very good and well priced.</li><li>This is a place that you 're really only here for the food.</li><li>The food did n't take long to come at all ( maybe 10 mins) and the service was quite attentive.</li><li>The service is also great- they all speak english which is nice and they try and get your banchan to your table as soon as you finished ordering, so you have something to hold you over while your food is prepared.</li><li>Food is great, ridiculously cheap and it 's great if you are rather unadventurous and just want to eat the same thing every time.</li><li>I ca n't believe how much I liked this place for someone who has never tried this kind of food before!</li><li>You will guarantee to have a great experience no matter when you visit.- service is fast and no nonsense! bang bang bang you will get your food on the table in less than 10 minutes- Pipping hot, bubbling tofu soup in a hot pot !!</li><li>The food here is cheap and tasty.</li><li>Rating: Service: 3/5 Food Quality: 3/5 Comfort 3/5 Decor 3/5 Value: 4/5 Parking: 2/5.</li><li>My experience with Korean food has mostly been with Pork Bone soup or at Korean BBQ restaurants where you grill your own food.</li><li>I 'm guessing that 's a sign that the food must be authentic.</li><li>Come here for the food, not the decor or the parking.</li><li>The food was good.</li><li>Delicious Food.</li><li>The food came out in 10 minutes.</li><li>Onto the food:- the meat and brisket they serve with the soup is delicious, however I found the broth a bit bland- purple rice is very very good. i had the seafood soon tofu.</li><li>Delicious food.</li><li>The food is great I 've tried everything my favorite is the dumpling and soon tofu.</li><li>The food is delicious and affordable.</li><li>Overall, it 's great food and fast service.</li><li>I ll go back again for tofu soup. everything on the menu ( 9 things) is divineness. service is quick, but that 's asian food for ya!</li><li>The food was pretty good, not salty at all which is wonderful for me compared to other places I have gone to.</li><li>My favourite food is tofu.</li><li>Everyone was quite friendly and the food came quickly.</li><li>The food is yummy and filling and the service is quick!</li><li>We did n't wait that long today and we got our food within a short time.</li><li>The food was suprisingly good, especially the purple rice.</li><li>Decent service, AMAZING food, always consistent.</li><li>The atmosphere is n't amazing, but the food and quality of service makes up for it.</li><li>For food, see my review of the downtown location.</li><li>The food seemed to me to be identical in preparation and quality here.</li><li>Simple menu, food was delicious and arrived within about 5 mins.</li><li>Wish could a dd more food choices!</li><li>Does not appear to have MSG in the food which is always a good thing.</li><li>The came by to check and see how our food was.</li><li>You choose from a handful of bubbling stone soups served with purple rice and every meal comes with a variety of banchan ( an array of appetizers) It 's always bustling to the point that the windows are steamy, conversation buzzes and the food tastes great!</li><li>The food is tasty, quick, and very cheap.</li><li>The food was ok but the service sucked!</li><li>The restaurant is almost always packed, which to many people is a sign of good food.</li><li>They serve your food in a very fancy stone pot ( that they cooked in a normal rice cooker then placed on the hot stone.</li><li>Eek methinks not for this place The limited variety of food.</li><li>Menu is tiny, only 9 food items, very limited # of drinks ... was looking for Korean BBQ ribs, none on the menu so I had the broiled BBQ beef which was good, served with a few side dishes, loved the dark little bean type item, not sure what it is though ???</li><li>Pros: Affordable, convenient location, food did taste good, free parking behind the resto ( I think).</li><li>Im glad in seattle there are korean people everywhere and the food is amazing.</li><li>Having been here on multiple occassions, I can attest to the deliciousness of the food here.</li><li>The food and quality is exceptional.</li><li>The food here was good, I 'll give them that.</li><li>Overall good food, just lacking a bit in terms of overall experience.</li><li>Amazing food !!</li><li>The food itself came out pretty quickly and the bibimbap was definitely tasty but I would n't call it the best in Toronto, not by a long shot.</li><li>I 'm giving this place 3 stars to be nice because the food was pretty good but with the abhorrent service and complete lack of communication skills by the wait staff severely impacted our meal- and could possibly have posed a health risk for my allergic friend.</li><li>Plus it 's so cheap for the food quality you get.</li><li>Cheap and cheerful place with amazing food.</li><li>The fact that lots of people wait in line in the freezing winter is a testament to how good the food is.</li><li>You have to ignore it for the great flavor of the food.</li><li>By the end of the meal, those little flies were basically walking around in the kimchi sauce, and I was too fed up to continue to defend my food.</li><li>Will not come again until we actually have a food shortage and humans begin to eat bugs, at least I 'll know where to find them easily.</li><li>The service is good and the food is delicious.</li><li>The service is quick and friendly, the food is great, and the prices are very favourable.</li><li>The food is very filling and more than satisfied the taste buds.</li><li>You want all of your ' stuffing' to be mixed well to truely enjoy this food!</li><li>Food is Cheap here and Service is great.</li><li>The food was great we got 2 #3 combos if you like spicy I would recommend ordering regular spicy or higher.</li><li>The food was quick and almost all items on the menu were under $ 10, which quickly filled me up.</li><li>I find the menu is limited and the food tasted average.</li><li>If I may expand on the food options, they have several varieties of soft tofu stews.</li><li>Great value + delicious food = success.</li><li>It stills serves the same food and whatnot, but the soups and rice just do n't taste as good.</li><li>4 stars for super cheap food, decent seating and steaming hot tofu lava stone pot.</li><li>One of my favorite food is tofu soup, and they do the really good one.</li><li>Food is cheap with a typical soon tofu stew with rice for $ 8.95 plus tax.</li><li>So I tried her food and yuk!</li><li>Overall one of my favorite Korean spots in North York. love this place! friendly environment, reasonable price and delicious soup! the only thing they could work on is perhaps on the decorations inside the restaurant, but when the food is so good and fast, who cares if the walls are bare.</li><li>Really cheap and tasty comfort food.</li><li>Love it. the food is really light, so you do n't feel full after .. and people are very nice.</li><li>Food: Again, food is delicious and inexpensive.</li><li>A lot of the times, the food from the table is flung on to the floor and sometimes further.</li><li>Anyway, let 's call this a 3 and enjoy some spicy food!</li><li>Anyhow, love coming here and think the food is delicious.</li><li>The wait staff was efficient and kind, and our food came shortly.</li><li>Food was brought out to us really quick, although the server brought my girlfriend something different from what she had ordered.</li><li>It was still great food regardless.</li><li>Food was hideous!</li><li>The food is dry and the soup is awful!</li><li>The menu is limited but the food is great and always consistent.</li><li>The prices are also extremely cheap for the amount of food you get.</li><li>Simple menu, but good food.</li><li>It 's a rather small place, but there 's enough room for your food, without being too squished.</li><li>It was JUST enough food- full, but not stuffed.</li><li>The food is excellent and the price is more than reasonable.</li><li>Great food.</li><li>Food was way too salty, and I thought the purple rice hot stone bowl was a huge source of waste ( so much of the rice was stuck in the stone pot!)</li><li>The wait for our food was ok.</li><li>Despite the limited selection on their menu, the food was delicious.</li><li>Soontofu is a comfort food for me.</li><li>If you 're not good with spicy food make sure you ask them to make it NON-SPICY, but for all you tough guys out there, they also do SUPER-SPICY.</li><li>A little overpriced, but when you get the food, you realize everything is way overpriced for the quantity and quality of the food.</li><li>A little overpriced, but when you get the food, you realize everything is way overpriced for the quantity and quality of the food.</li><li>I was not expecting good food at this place as I have been here numerous times since I was a child, and the only memorable experience I have ever had at memories of Japan was my first time here eating at the teppenyaki table when I was a child, and the Cook giving us an amazing show of flipping salt and pepper shakers, telling jokes, and cooking spectacularly.</li><li>If you are here for sashimi and cooked food it will come faster.</li><li>The food 2.5 star.</li><li>The service was ok .... food was another story.</li><li>What I 've notice recently is that their quality of food has gone down since they decided to serve AYCE.</li><li>The chef was really entertaining but the food was so so.</li><li>For fish eggs they use food colouring and the rolls are pathetic!</li><li>Terrible food, terrible service.</li><li>This was an okay place to go to years ago when their food quality was better, and competition was less stiff.</li><li>Given all the choices Toronto has to offer -- better Japanese food, or equal-quality food for less money -- I am surprised this place is still in business today.</li><li>We ordered $ 70.00 worth of food.</li><li>They cook for each person, serve them their food, bid farewell and leave and you can enjoy your tasty meal that was cooked fresh right in front of your eyes!</li><li>I rarely give one star reviews, but our food was so bad that I had to grab a veggie burger at near-by Harveys because I was starving and did n't want to pay more to feed myself.</li><li>We 've waited an hour and a half for our food to come, and still have to wait longer for the chef to cook our food.</li><li>We 've waited an hour and a half for our food to come, and still have to wait longer for the chef to cook our food.</li><li>I ca n't comment on the food because that was enough to make me never want to eat here.</li><li>We waited over 1.5 hours for our food, understood it was a busy night so when we politely asked about our order we found out they had lost it ...</li><li>Completely ruined our night ... whats worst is that we did n't even get an apology ... food is actually not that bad. the shrimp tempura was excellent. the waiting staff was atrocious. super slow and just brain dead. the only person who cleaned our table was the manager! the desert menu is very small. the also did not have a lot of the stuff that was advertised on the menu. i did like how they made the maki rolls with real japanese rice. we paid about $ 71 for two adults and a 4 year old, tips not included. the decor is pretty awful. the chairs were very ugly. it was very dark inside. we sat near the windows so that helped a bit in terms of lighting. i will never come here again.</li><li>When my office relocated to Don Mills and Eglinton/Lawrence area, I was happy that I was able to once again enjoy the food a little bit more frequently, visiting often to pick up food for lunch, or ordering for delivery when I could not leave the office.</li><li>When my office relocated to Don Mills and Eglinton/Lawrence area, I was happy that I was able to once again enjoy the

so I needed something quick, so I placed an order to pick up food.</li><li>When I received the food, I noticed on the bill that the price was not the same as the website, and when I mentioned this, all she said was `` yeah I know''.</li><li>The only reason I gave it a 2-star instead of 1 was because the food is still good and I ca n't knock that, no matter how much the lady pissed me off.</li><li>Teppanyaki is not only about the food but the performance of the teppanyaki chef.</li><li>The food was delicious and every thing was served up with a sense of professionalism and humour.</li><li>The food also came out really slowly, and a lot of items on their menu they actually did not have ( this happened for about 5 of the items we asked for- mostly the desserts).</li><li>But with that said the quality of food was above par in terms of taste and quality.</li><li>The cooked food that came out were room temperature and was n't as good.</li><li>The food itself tasted fine, but even the order in which he cooked it was weird.</li><li>Went for AYCE sushi and did not have a pleasant experience:- Beef short ribs were n't fresh- All the rolls were falling apart- Chicken udon hardly had any chicken in it- Hand rolls were disappointing- waaay too much rice Staff decided that we ordered way too much food and kept telling us that we would n't be able to finish it.</li><li>First time service was good and food was fine.</li><li>All of the food was good.</li><li>I am looking forward to see if their food is a saving grace or ammunition for another novel ..</li><li>I 'm not giving this place 4 stars just for the food.</li><li>The serving is not overwhelmed due to small portion of the food.</li><li>Delicious food.</li><li>The preparation of food ( show) is the big draw here.</li><li>He kept us entertained and served us delicious food.</li><li>I found the food was fresh and tasted good.</li><li>I live about 5 minutes away from the restaurant, and I 've been wearing my contacts all day so because the food took so long to come already being 40 minutes into the wait I left and drove home to get my glasses- drove back and STILL the food was n't there.</li><li>I live about 5 minutes away from the restaurant, and I 've been wearing my contacts all day so because the food took so long to come already being 40 minutes into the wait I left

!!</li><li>And terrible service when told of a food allergy.</li><li>The food has gotten better along with the staff as the place has grown over the years.</li><li>The food is standard and comes out fairly quickly.</li><li>It is nothing special, but it 's always cooked well and I have never had a problem with my food.</li><li>I do suggest going with any bento box combo they offer as they come with a lot of choices of food and will fill you up.</li><li>Should let us know they 're crazy busy not some excuse where they put out when we call to inquire for our food.</li><li>Compare to Genghis Khan Mongolian Grill next door, with the same price you get much more, plus fresh food and better service.</li><li>Best food reasonable price.</li><li>Food is n't much different than any other AYCE, sashimi was good but nothing exciting.</li><li>The food was good except they over cooked my shrimp and another guests lobster.</li><li>I think this restaurant gives good quality food for what we pay.</li><li>They only cook the food when ordered, therefore, it is tasty and fresh.</li><li>I personally did not taste much MSG in the food.</li><li>However the quality and flavour of the food is only average.</li><li>All were perfectly edible, but you should n't go here expecting the most delicious food ever.</li><li>The food was surprisingly good.</li><li>It 's pretty good ... staff is

to give it one more try and if the food gets any better I will update this post.</li><li>Even the cheese was cheap and nasty. just CHEAP food and I can have a better meal going to loblaws and buying a frozen tv dinner.</li><li>The food was disgusting!</li><li>The food had obviously been frozen as it looked and tasted worse than microwavable frozen meals.</li><li>Ca n't believe they charge sooo much for disgusting food.</li><li>Better yet, buy some frozen food- tastes better!</li><li>I 'm not a big gourmet dinner, but the food is fresh and home made.</li><li>The food was good, my daughter loved the gnocchi, I had the sea bass and it was quite good.</li><li>Whatever the case the food is delicious.</li><li>It 's humble interior masks literally* the* best Italian food you could possibly find!</li><li>The cafeteria-style food looked a little dry from being out in a cafeteria line for me, so I opted for a pizza, which would be made fresh.</li><li>They are clearly very busy, but I felt I was bothering them just to pay for my food.</li><li>Their food is a bit pricy ...</li><li>The food was all completely soggy, old, flavourless and really just a comical letdown considering my office was ok with McDonalds ( and it would have been better and cheaper).</li><li>I think they need to work on the quality of the food, the length of time they keep it on the line for serving, and the general attitude of the staff.</li><li>Then when I tasted the food I just felt like I was transported away to some breezy bistro on the coast of Italy where I was tasting the most authentic freshly housemade alfredo pasta with cheese filling- so worthy of the 5 lbs of fat I will likely gain over the next week:) I have no regrets!</li><li>It 's a perfect casual spot to bring friends or family out of town for a bite to eat or to impress your date/colleagues with your great taste in food:) They will thank you, although ... their waistlines may not.</li><li>P. S. I broke my rules and was n't able to take a photo of the above-described food.</li><li>It was simply that good- it was almost impossible to think of anything else but how good the food smelled/looked/tasted &amp; I lost track &amp; forgot about the pics.</li><li>Overall a pretty good experience when you stick to the coffee ( this is the real stuff) and savoury food.</li><li>The staff were so kind, sweet and helpful, and the food is home-cooked Italian!</li><li>No frills, no fuss, and nothing pretentious ... just good food and good people.</li><li>Fit for Life is a-okay for food court lunch or breakfast.</li><li>Since this place changed management, the quality of the food and service both took a deep dive.</li><li>Now they increased these boxed Lunches to $ 6.99 and you get less food.</li><li>All their menus changed to reflect what I believe is their corporate menu and they have less control over pricing and food quality.</li><li>Unfortunately, the other 2 places in the same food court are just as bad: ( I guess you can call this the better of the worst.</li><li>I was a little big put off by the food preparation methods I observed though.</li><li>Some of the cold foods in the counter were pilled onto each other, servers were using the same gloves hand to touch multiple food items ( there was beet juice on the cantaloupe) and the kitchen space seemed a bit dingy.</li><li>The food seemed to agree with me though so I 'll probably be back at some point for another quick lunch.</li><li>Otherwise the food was great after we took control of the situation.</li><li>You choose your food and they ask for your card.</li><li>The good thing for a group is that every one get a card and can order whatever like beverage, different kind of food and every time they charge your card and at the end every one can pay her own bill separately.</li><li>The verity of food are limited and the quality are medium.</li><li>The price does NOT reflect the quality of the food.</li><li>Review: I still would n't take `` guests'' there as there are tons of restaurants with MUCH better service and better food.</li><li>Not much of a variety of food to choose from.</li><li>Food was n't too bad but could be better.</li><li>The food is always mediocre, the queues long and the food overpriced but our daughters enjoy going station to station so periodically, we go.</li><li>The food is always mediocre, the queues long and the food overpriced but our daughters enjoy going station to station so periodically, we go.</li><li>The food is certainly overpriced, but the food is decent and the ingredients are fresh.</li><li>The food is certainly overpriced, but the food is decent and the ingredients are fresh.</li><li>Everytime I come back to Toronto, I always have to at least come here once and have my picking of all the fresh food in this market style restaurant environment.</li><li>But the food is ..... so middle-of-the-road unimaginative and unchanged over the years.</li><li>While the food itself was adequate ( I ordered a regular pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms and green peppers), my overall satisfaction with the restaurant was significantly negatively affected by the high levels of ambient noise.</li><li>The food quality is mediocre at best, the prices are high and the service is nonexistent.</li><li>We get there, have their food has already been removed ( they 're supposed to stay open until 2 a.m.) and the ones on display are almost rotting.</li><li>As for the food itself ... possibly one of the WORST foods I 've ever had in my life .. the chicken was pretty much ALL just bone chunks and the sauce was soo sticcky from sitting out in the open for so long and I could n't take it ... okay maybe their dessert will be better ?</li><li>First time to take my daughter to this place, I used to go there quite a lot in the early 2000, but then, we did n't go as we found that their price is a bit too high but the quality of the food does not qualify with that.</li><li>Regarding the food: The juice bar is recommended.</li><li>When you visiting Richtree 's Market place, you have to expect the following things: 1. self-service 2. so-so to ok food If you go in with those expectations, you 'll be fine.</li><li>Marketplace offers a plethora of choices in terms of food stations, and you just go up and take a look at what each cooking stations offers.</li><li>The minuses can and may or may not be limited to kids running around, which may or may not be to your perference; grouchy-faced employees; not exactly efficient service for your food; I think the BF 's pasta took longer than it should have and it apparently was n't that good.</li><li>I still like the atmosphere, but I think the quality of the food has declined.</li><li>- I was here at 7:30 am or so ... its empty ... looking for a newspaper, guess they do n't have any, so I sit down to `` enjoy'' my food.</li><li>I agree with others that the food is n't anything special; the only thing I usually eat is the rösti.</li><li>It is generally a nice place to gather and the food is decent, but just do n't expect too much.</li><li>The food there is still pretty bad.</li><li>The food is made right in front of your eyes and you know exactly what 's in your plate.</li><li>When it comes to the food, you know what to expect.</li><li>The food is still not worth what you 're paying.</li><li>You pay way too much for if anything, average food that you can get elsewhere.</li><li>As you walk in, you are given a blank shopping card and there are several food stations around the restaurant.</li><li>My food was n't as flavorful as I last remembered.</li><li>What I do like about this place is the decor, the friendly and efficient service and the variety of food.</li><li>The food is borderline passable in general with the soup being quite tasty however their seafood section leaves something to be desired.</li><li>I have n't been ages and it seems like the quality of food has gone down a bit.</li><li>Prices are outrageous, staff are rude, except for nice hostesses, and best food is the squash soup, chicken and Caesar salads.</li><li>When you walk in and see the `` plastic jungle/forest'' decor, it 's a perfect indication of what the food is going to be like .... not good, but not bad enough to be offensive.</li><li>The prices are closer to fine dining but the food is closer to glorified high school cafeteria fare.</li><li>Not enough choices of food.</li><li>We are both suffering from terrible food poisoning this morning.</li><li>I visited today with my family we really enjoy the food and the staff is really friendly.</li><li>Over the years, we 've often come here for brunch or desserts, but it seems that the quality of the food keeps going down the drain.</li><li>The food was what I expected and good place for a large group of people.</li><li>Great food at this particular BP location.</li><li>Boston Pizza has a bad rap where I work, as greasy fast sit-down food.</li><li>I 've gone here in large groups and they do the pre-ordering thing, so the food is basically ready when you sit down.</li><li>The food was meh ... the garden salad was pretty gross as the lettuce used was obvi old.</li><li>Food was alright.</li><li>Great place to hang out and drink, do n't come here if you expect good food ...</li><li>If you 're drunk then dog food would taste amazing anyway ...</li><li>Sat on the patio which was pretty nice, but had really poor quality food and was basically ignored by the staff.</li><li>Had a better experience eating inside service-wise, but the food is really the shits.</li><li>Finally after he went back and forth from the computer and reviewed our order 4 times ... about 20 mins passed and we got our food ...</li><li>Took forever to be seated, the staff were not at all friendly or interested in providing a good experience, and the food was not good.</li><li>The food is okay; at this location, the bar is king.</li><li>Again, the food is decent.</li><li>The food and drinks may not be the greatest but the service is always good.</li><li>If it were n't for the food being crappy occasionally, I 'd enjoy coming here more often.</li><li>I sat down knowing how much I could be spending and the quality of food I was going to get.</li><li>Overall, food and service was good however, I 've always felt that the food here is a bit overpriced.</li><li>Service is awesome ... food fantastic.</li><li>Every time I order from this place the delivery guy gives me an attitude and just today after ordering over $ 45 of food the delivery guy does n't give my change of $ 50 back! after I ask him for my change he gives me a weird look and tells me he has to go back and get change from his car !!!</li><li>Not a destination place for the food.</li><li>We ordered and the food was out shortly, as my mother ordered the Montreal smoked meat sandwich ( as it is her favourite anywhere we go), there was something quite rancid tasting about the meat, it had an odd smell and colour to the meat, as we were already in a rush from waiting so long for service we would n't have had time to choose another menu item/send it back, but that would not have mattered since our server did not come by once to check on how the food was.</li><li>We ordered and the food was out shortly, as my mother ordered the Montreal smoked meat sandwich ( as it is her favourite anywhere we go), there was something quite rancid tasting about the meat, it had an odd smell and colour to the meat, as we were already in a rush from waiting so long for service we would n't have had time to choose another menu item/send it back, but that would not have mattered since our server did not come by once to check on how the food was.</li><li>The food was mediocre for the price but given its a franchise restaurant I was n't going to be picky about the food.</li><li>The service was not very good as there was an approximate 10 minute gap between receiving my food and my girlfriend receiving her food.</li><li>When she received her dish, the food was already cold.</li><li>The food is a bit on the expensive side for what you get.</li><li>I 've been to the other location and the service, food and broth are not the same.</li><li>Free side dishes are very basic and they only give them to yiu when they serves your food.</li><li>So I guess the food is n't very hygienic ?</li><li>If I ever get sick from your food, I am going to give you lowest rating possible, hence the one star.</li><li>As for the food poisoning I got from eating the seafood tofu soup ...</li><li>I am also not surprised that other yelpers have posted reviews stating that THEY TOO had food poisoning.</li><li>Do n't get me wrong food tastes good and prices here are amazing but the effects of cross contamination is not fun.</li><li>My boyfriend had the BBQ L. A beef ribs.the food was okay, it was n't that bad for a first time.</li><li>I can see the staff cooking and preparing the food which they should be more careful.</li><li>Because I would question if the food is clean.</li><li>Love the food here!</li><li>Great food and customer service.</li><li>It 's my food!</li><li>What that has to do with Korean comfort food served in a diner-like setting is beyond me- perhaps the food is meant to make you smarter or perhaps it 's simply a wise decision to eat here if you are craving hearty Korean food served efficiently with no fuss.</li><li>I have never been disappointed in ordering the Pork Bone Soup as it always leaves me satisfied and always hit 's the spot when I am craving some hot, hearty, comfort food.</li><li>Cheap prices, great food, open late, I actually do n't mind this place ( I 'm stuck between a 3 or a 4 star).</li><li>All in all a decent place with decent food but nothing special.</li><li>Food: The food was piping hot, and everything turned out well.</li><li>The food is above average compared to casual Korean restaurants in the area.</li><li>Cheap food, check.</li><li>It 's open 24/7 and they make/serve really quick, which is really convenient if you 're a night owl ( hence the name Owl of Minerva i 'm guessing), but i found the food to be pretty bad ..</li><li>They 're not into the fancy fine dining nor are they a literal hole in the wall giving you hole in the wall food you could cook better yourself.</li><li>The price was a little ... pricer than we 'd liked, but w/e, if it was good food, then it 'd be worth it.</li><li>The place doesnt have a lot of food choices and I often order the kamjatang ( pork bone soup) Overall is good I think, although dont expect too much side dishes.</li><li>Fresh and nice food!</li><li>Loved the food and still do but it was very uncomfortable from the moment we ordered.</li><li>Did n't expect much from the service but my company and I enjoyed our food.</li><li>Service was good and the food was pretty good.</li><li>The food is always fresh and they 're open 24/7.</li><li>They have a new `` house'' rule, one bill, no splitting, which we found was very odd but I paid the bill and it was a fair amount for the food we got.</li><li>Interior is pretty hole-in-the-wallish but good food at good prices and lots of booze makes up for it.</li><li>The food here is subpar with very limited side, and very overpriced!</li><li>Overall experience was an epic fail, from their un welcoming staff, there 's this old lady that was very rude, she did even bother to greet, their place is a mess, it stinks and their food is over priced compare to other korean restaurants thats clean, cozy and accomodating ..</li><li>This is pretty much the food to get here.</li><li>The food is mediocre but the SERVICE WAS BAD.</li><li>Although their food is decent their service was horrible and it was really dark in there today- the only lights that were on were the ones on the wall which were pictures of their food ... and I know they aint trying to set the mood and be all romantic lol.</li><li>Although their food is decent their service was horrible and it was really dark in there today- the only lights that were on were the ones on the wall which were pictures of their food ... and I know they aint trying to set the mood and be all

my will)- I felt immediately sick after the meal Save yourself the money, headache and stomache, and go to another Korean restaurant that treats you with basic decency and serves better food.</li><li>The food at owl is kind of overpriced, a dollar or two above average from other korean places ..</li><li>The meal was unsatisfying and I could n't finish the food.</li><li>We ordered food to go:- bibimbap ( 3/5) Pretty good but I guess not the best take out option- bulgogi ( 4/5) Very yummy and not overly greasy- glass noodles ( 5/5) Delicious!</li><li>24hrs, quick service, good food.</li><li>One complaint I do have is that although it is comfort food, the pork bone soup is actually very very fattening.</li><li>However, if you do n't mind this fact, the food here is still very good and if you are looking for good korean food this is a good place to go ( not as good as the tofu place right down the street).</li><li>The food taste good.</li><li>The food is outstatnding and the waitress 's are nice.</li><li>Theu serve tons of food that is tasty and well prepared.</li><li>Great food, but more importantly amazing service.</li><li>I 've come here a few times and the food is ok.</li><li>There was a lot of left overs and when they were taking it away we asked if they were going to throw it out ( we would have loved to take it home) and the server said that they reuse the food.</li><li>Food was pretty good, service was awesome and overall a good experience.</li><li>Ca n't say I 'd return, food just is n't good enough.</li><li>I 'm giving this place a 5-star for having very patient and accommodating staff on top of great food.</li><li>Onto the food.</li><li>Five stars for patient, hard-working staff and excellent food.</li><li>Food is great and staff is amazing, he works his butt off!</li><li>First off, keeping in mind that this place is located on the ghetto west end, you ca n't expect much in terms of experience but you would at least expect the food to be great.</li><li>Other then the service and experience, the food phone was pretty good.</li><li>This is authentic and good food.</li><li>I do n't know how authentic the food is, but I found it to be delicious and filling, and that is all that matters to me.</li><li>Good food, good portions It is cash only, be prepared, cause it doesnt say it anywhere.</li><li>Besides that, the food was decent and the prices were reasonable.</li><li>The restaurant itself is n't too visually appealing, but if you put decor to the side and focus on the food, then it 's great value.</li><li>Food was good.</li><li>The rest of the food here was also really good.</li><li>Great service and good food.</li><li>They did this with all employees, so customers beware! portions here are really generous. the workers and waitresses are also really nice. for the people who are complaining about how the workers are ( ie rolliing the dirty dishes around etc) ... thats typically a normal vietnamese resturant for you. if u think this is dirty then u should not go to vietnam lol. but anywho, food here is really good. my parents go here every other day or so cos its close to their work and i also know a friend who eats here everyday too just cause he loves it. the pho, rice, and bun mam is really yummy. also my aunt is obssessed with their viet coffee as she says its authentic since there is so much flavour! also really cheap too:) oh yeah its cash only ... i think by now its safe to say if u go anywhere asian, just have cash with u cos chances are they are not going to take debit or credit!</li><li>The food not bad, but the owner of the pub is complete jerk.</li><li>Our lovely server which i did n't get the name of quickly came to us and asked us if we wanted any drinks then we ordered the food.</li><li>The place was fun to be at but the food pretty much sucked.</li><li>Not only did the food take an exceptionally long time to arrive, ( there were only about 6 other people who ordered after us) but the portions were off.</li><li>Horrible service and food.</li><li>Service and food is disgusting.</li><li>Now onto their `` food''.</li><li>The last few times I went the food was not on point.</li><li>A nice restaurant, food is great but a bit noisy, the staff tried hard to please our group of ten and genuinely met our expectation.</li><li>We had a great time there and again, food was good.</li><li>Modern decor, good service, great food quality.</li><li>The food was n't amazing but it was done well and satisfying.</li><li>The service is fast and the food comes flying out the kitchen.:-).</li><li>Whatever I order, no matter what amount of food, even if it 's completely different from the last time I always end up paying 70.</li><li>The food is on another level from all the other locations, and the service is attentive.</li><li>Happy Women 's Day! = D I 've had my Korean, Indian, Russian, Chinese and ' Other Asian' friends here and they were all impressed by the food.</li><li>Food was very good the service was mediocre.</li><li>The food is delicious though some things have too much oil imho.</li><li>On the downside, at our last visit, we had a waiter by the name of Collin who slammed the dishes down on the table after we told him we just needed takeout boxes so we can pack up the extra food home ourselves.</li><li>Great food and good service!</li><li>A decent chinese restaurant with good food and clean washrooms.</li><li>On the other hand, the food is truly amazing.</li><li>I tried to do take out here to avoid the sloppiness of the staff 's customer service, but each time i take out i do not get what i order or the food depreciate in taste and quality.</li><li>Not that I have tried all other locations, I am just happy this one is close by, and the food and service has been consistent ever since they opened here.</li><li>The food here is good and it comes out hot and super quick.</li><li>For the reliability and overall quality of food ordered, this is a place worth revisiting all the time.</li><li>Remarkably loud, the food and service were pretty good for a place as full as this.</li><li>Food was good and tasty!</li><li>The food seemed to be made hastily, and if not, certainly delivered so, because the dumplings were all stuck together in one place.</li><li>The food here is authentic and always proportioned welled.</li><li>The food comes out quick and hot.</li><li>Along with the great food, the restaurant decor feels amazing and looks like a true restaurant.</li><li>The price is decent and the food 's great. the waiters are always pretty nice and things are served pretty fast, even during rush hours.</li><li>Asian Legend food is normally good but not this one.</li><li>The food here is always decent, and even during busy times they keep your tea pot full.</li><li>Initially wanting to just go with something light- somehow we ordered crab tofu, Shanghainese seafood noodle, beef pancake rolls, fried whole fish in brown sauce, garlic stir fried string beans, appetizer platter sampler ( drunken chicken, jellyfish, and pork ?) and two orders of crab meat soup dumplings ( yep too much food for the 5 of us).</li><li>Awesome food, friendly, on point service, and extremely reasonable price.</li><li>The food was pretty good, though I wo n't say it was the best I 've had.</li><li>Fantastic food.</li><li>I 've been here a few times and the food is decent.</li><li>I always feel heavy and full after an Asian Legend outing as the food is simply too good to pass up.</li><li>Having said that, the food is quite good especially when compared to many other shanghainese places in Toronto.</li><li>Usually dependable and good food.</li><li>Order food you can recognize and it will be good, We like the dim sum, hot and sour soup, cream of corn soup, shrimp dishes, beef dishes, and noodles,.</li><li>We are very disappointment with both the service and food quality.</li><li>I 'm sure their food is okay but I have n't been back since: ( still sad.</li><li>Table was too small for all the food ordered and waiter struggled to organize.</li><li>We were really filled, and the food was quite good.</li><li>Excellent Shanghainese/Taiwanese food.</li><li>They have specific employees that serve out the food only which is a much more efficient way to operate in my point of view.</li><li>They are pretty consistent with the food quality.</li><li>Always consistent service and food quality.</li><li>Solid food, I always get the classics.</li><li>The food is very good.</li><li>I usually go with my family so we order a lot of food and share them.</li><li>Great food.</li><li>Quality and taste of the food is always a constant excellent at this location.</li><li>The food is decent but nothing surprising.</li><li>They have lots of good food for decent prices so I 'll definitely make my way back here again.</li><li>The food is still ok, but not great.</li><li>For a family of 4 + baby it was a good amount of food and reasonably priced.</li><li>The food came fast and was decently fresh- dimsum was steaming hot, but our cold noodles were stuck together ( maybe left out too long ?).</li><li>Pros: great food, lots of variety of dish Cons: loudness of clanging utensil at the back &amp; lack of good service.</li><li>We 've been coming here for well over 10 years and I am happy to say that the quality of food has not gone down.</li><li>While Asian Legend is n't at that level ( yet), I 'm still quite satisfied with the food that comes out here.</li><li>These are characterized by generally reasonable prices, less than stellar decor, no attention on service, and minimal attempt at making the food look nice.</li><li>The food is often not authentic, and served on really nice plates.</li><li>The food quality is good.</li><li>AL 's food seemed to have contained either no MSG or very little.</li><li>I was pleasantly surprised by the food quality at Asian Legend.</li><li>Asian Legend 's food is not bad; it ranges from good to mediocre.</li><li>The food and service were great.</li><li>I 'm so disappointed because I love Asian Legend ( and other location but something happened today where some of the food was terrible and the service mediocre It was Sunday around 1:30pm and the place was pretty full.</li><li>If I were in the area, I might not come back here, but instead go to Peking Man ( although the decor is not the best, the food is much better than this).</li><li>Food is good decor is okay.</li><li>MOST importantly: The food is consistent and delicious with reasonable prices Favorites: D r a g o n B u n s- I honestly do n't think there has been a time that I 've been here and NOT ordered any dragon buns.</li><li>Plus they have a nice mixture of food with Northern Dumplings and Shanghai Noodles and Southern comfort foods like Sweet and Sour pork.</li><li>Service is quite good Food: come in large portions with a very reasonable price They give you free red bean soup as dessert.</li><li>The staff work quick to get the food and I like sitting in the quiet environment.</li><li>Its beyond the deliciousness of the food; it 's the broken arcade machine; it 's the soap operas always on the tv; it 's the nudy photos on the wall; the sunshine girl behind the cash and the leftover cocaine under the guy at counter 's nose.</li><li>The place itself is completely run down, always get the food to go.</li><li>The place is pretty much a dump or whole in the wall ... but is n't that what you want in a `` dive'' ... those are the best places for good food!</li><li>Friendly staff is accompanied by amazing food and great prices.</li><li>We were all pretty happy with the food and the service was pretty good.</li><li>The food is out of this world especially the Tuscan chicken.</li><li>Most appear to get desert or appetizers, which is probably why their food is so good, because it really is prepared fresh.</li><li>I 've been to the restaurant a few times and thought that the service was terrible, the food was average, and the dessert was okay.</li><li>The food itself is also pretty poor but I found that the quality has been improving since the management was switched.</li><li>After experiencing poor service and avg food on more than one occasion, and witnessing and hearing about how terrible they treat their staff, Ill take my business else where.</li><li>The food was not only great-tasting, but presented very well.</li><li>I went here with a group of colleagues for a work lunch, and after 90 minutes we still had not received all of our food.</li><li>I have also come here with friends as well and even then we had great service and good food with minimal supervision and a very laid back setting which to me did n't bother me at all.</li><li>My disappointment was little to do with the food and more to do with the service.</li><li>How is this place--with their overpriced menu, awful food, cheapy decor, and mediocre service--still in business ????</li><li>As for their food, I 'm not the biggest fan.</li><li>The food however was incredibly poor.</li><li>After 10-15 minutes, our food came.</li><li>Our food came super fast, mainly I think because the diner was closing.</li><li>Simple food, but tasty.</li><li>Food was ok.</li><li>Food was OK.</li><li>Nice and comfortable booth seating- they have the 1960 's look with all the nostalgic photos and props. food is always good. portions are quite decent, almost large too.</li><li>Food was simply ok.</li><li>The food came to us fairly quickly.</li><li>Average food.</li><li>Usually this kind of food is not my cup of tea.</li><li>The food was n't bad but it was n't terrible either.</li><li>They should have just called it grilled chicken Anyways, the food was still very edible.</li><li>Even though it 's not my type of food, I would n't rule this place out for the future.</li><li>Great atmosphere and decent food, works for me.</li><li>Sat a table noticed some sort of food spot/stain on the table, asked the waitress if she could wipe it, she did but did n't even remove the stain because she barely pressed the cloth to the table and the nightmare begins ...</li><li>Great food, very friendly and effective service, pleasant patrons.</li><li>I 've found faux diner joints like Johnny Rockets to serve really substandard food.</li><li>Great food, great staff, and most of all great prices.</li><li>All for around $ 10, great price for such great food.</li><li>Pretty decent, if definitely come back for the large portions and the food in a pinch!</li><li>The prices are a little high, particularly on the add-ons and the service feels a little arrogant at times, but the food makes up for it.</li><li>Let me also tell you that when I use the word delicious, I am speaking specifically about the taste and texture of the food.</li><li>So much so, that I always make sure to get an espresso while I 'm waiting for my food and a Brio to drink with my sandwich.</li><li>Overall, I love the food but the wait time is insane.</li><li>I suggest the food to anyone as long as you visit earlier in the day.</li><li>Great food and service.</li><li>However well worth it for the quality of food.</li><li>Great food.</li><li>Great food.</li><li>Well think of it this way if you want good food, then you need to pay for it.</li><li>There 's nothing better then fresh, great food.</li><li>This good food for fair price.</li><li>Food is always piping hot.</li><li>Prices are very reasonable considering the amount of food you get.</li><li>Surprisingly good food.</li><li>They 're friendly on the phone, one guy is a total boss, the other sometimes confused, but the food always arrives quickly and hot.</li><li>I went on their website and saw they have a wide range of food to choose.</li><li>Especially considering their food was dirt cheap.</li><li>I go to this restaurant regularly because of its great value and tasty food.</li><li>Although their are n't a lot of food choices to choose from, but the Wonton there are amazing!</li><li>Overall, its a good place to go if you are under a budget! so sad! this place is close! i used to come here but recently i realize that it 's been replace by a korean restaurant. the wontons are so filled with shrimp, the fish balls had bones in them i always get scared the bones might choke me but the food tasted awesome! hot water dispenser is at each table so you make your own tea. the soups tasted too much of msg ... delicious but ... msg is bad for you. bye bye wonton place, i kinda miss you. small portions, but i love how u can put your own oyster sauce into your noodles, instead of asking like other regular wonton noodle places. also enjoyed having a hot water faucet at my table. clean and good atmosphere.</li><li>As other reviewers mentioned, the food is very cheap.</li><li>The food was quite good, especially the wonton.</li><li>It costs average $ 5 for a bowl which will fill you up, and you get your food pretty much instantly.</li><li>The food was excellent but I hated the smell of the restaurant- it was really really fishy.</li><li>The food does n't taste fishy at all though.</li><li>The food is probably home made, but I suspect it 's frozen.</li><li>Thank you previous reviewers- you were well on point when you said the food was fabulous here.</li><li>Good food, good conversation, good company, a little knowledge shared about Italian cuisine, Portugal, Burt Reynolds ' cocktail, breakfast faves and Arnold Schwarzenegger movies = an excellent night for sure.</li><li>The food is consistent, but a bit pricey.</li><li>The food is good and they are one of the only breakfast joints around here, or even uptown for that matter.</li><li>Reason for stars: The food is okay and the most breakfast oriented restaurant in the area but the long lineup before going in just puts everyone in a cruddy mood before even ordering.</li><li>The food was up to Coras standards plentiful, fresh decent priced.</li><li>The staff is very friendly and the food is very yummy and big portions.</li><li>Our food came super fast and at the same time which is always nice.</li><li>The food is really great: waffles and omelettes, milkshakes and smoothies ...</li><li>Although the service was slow, and when I say slow it means we waited for almost an hour to get our food ..</li><li>The food here is good, but it 's the service that keeps me coming back here.</li><li>I was very impressed with my service from Paula and for the most part, the food received.</li><li>The ONLY thing I would say about the food I received would that the tomatoes were not so fresh, seemed like they were either frozen at one point or either they were not kept at the certified cold temp, even though the kitchen is hot at all times, there is no reason why the tomatoes cannot be kept at the certified cold temps.</li><li>The food is amazing and they give you big portions that fill you up.</li><li>The food was generally good, including the smoke salmon Benny &amp; my wife 's western omelette.</li><li>Overall the quality of food and service rates a three out of five, but definitely not to be a regular joint.</li><li>Where they have wonderful food, service and ambiance.</li><li>Not only have I tried ordering from the gluten sensitive page, she was not able to confirm or the knowledge that the staff and the kitchen are prepared and/or trained as they should be to prepare the food properly and check the ingredients in certain premade items such as bacon.</li><li>The food itself tasted good and came in huge portion sizes ( a crepe could feed two).</li><li>She had long blonde hair, older) who was eating food through the pass through window where the cooks put the food out.</li><li>The always make the plating of the food really decorative which is always a bonus.</li><li>Food was good.</li><li>If they had a peanut-free menu but the server keeps telling you that your meal may have come in contact with, or contains peanuts, would you feel safe eating their food ?</li><li>Side are very basic but just like the owl they tend to give then when you get you food.</li><li>A new customer who does not know what food to order is not given any recommendations other then: `` Everything here is equally good and popular.''</li><li>As for the food, the most popular dish I saw was gamjatang.</li><li>The pricing was okay, but I 'd rather not pay for terrible service and okay/bad food.</li><li>Oh, and the restaurant has an excessive cooking smell that makes your clothes smell like food ... and by excessive, I mean a lot more compared to other restaurants.</li><li>But they give many side dishes and food are actually pretty nice.</li><li>Would not recommend this place, since the food is usually lower quality than I 've previously experienced at other Korean restaurants nearby.</li><li>We waited a good 25 minutes for our food to arrive after ordering and when my friend asked for a refill on their awesome potatoes side dish, the waitress gave us the cut eye and threw the dish on our table ( maybe this lady was having a bad day but she was pretty rude).</li><li>The food quality was ok, I ordered the katsu with egg and rice, it was good ( cooked well) and the portion serving was pretty generous, it 's just the service and the lack of a lunch menu that ruined our experience.</li><li>Apparently they are refilled free of charge but I 've never had the urge to refill as I want to eat/enjoy the food that I order.</li><li>Service is really fast and the food has been consistenly yummy the handful of times that I 've been.</li><li>Food only so so.</li><li>Food was decent, service was mediocre.</li><li>The food is decent.</li><li>One final point is that the banchan comes out just before the food ( I 'm not sure if this is typical in Toronto, but I 'm used to it coming out shortly after placing an order).</li><li>I hate waiting a long time for food, so I do n't think I 'll return.</li><li>I like the food at Nak Won.</li><li>I was n't really blown away by the food in the place.</li><li>The sad thing is the food at this place is pretty decent.</li><li>On the other hand, their food was good.</li><li>The food came in one at a time.</li><li>The only reason this does n't get 5 stars is the service which is acceptable- more smiles would be nice, but hey, when the food is this good, you can live without it!</li><li>I walk in and everyone ( the customers) were just sitting there eating or waiting to order/for their food to come out.</li><li>Anyways, moving onto the food ...</li><li>Overall the food is fair, but lacks any distinct or memorable flavour.</li><li>Great food, cheap price.</li><li>If the food is excellent, I would have been OK.</li><li>There are so many other Korean restaurants around the area with similar quality of food but services are much better, seating a lot more comfy.</li><li>But I am willing to walk a mile just to have better food! 7/15.</li><li>The food displays gives Nak Won this appeal that would draw your interest to it.</li><li>Our food did get brought out at a reasonable pace and the dishes looked good enough.</li><li>The food looked and tasted comforting enough, with a quick-fix level type flair.</li><li>Anyhow, its still a place of good food and great value. mmm pork potato stew is always a must, stone pot bim bi bap is also awesome. i like they give you many plates of apps unlike some of the other restaurants ... just dont ever count on a water refill or extra piece or napkin, you will never get it.</li><li>I should have took notice but I was hungry and ignored this sign.* Food* Side-dishes: SLIMY and WARM.</li><li>Then again, I did n't even eat anything so what 's there to consume but slimy and luke-warm food ?</li><li>The waiter that served us would just dump the food on the table without saying a word and had a bad attitude the whole time.</li><li>The food itself was horrible, too.</li><li>Like 10 minutes later she comes back to take back the food I ordered.</li><li>After awhile, she came back with my food and basically dumped it on my table.</li><li>We were starving at that point so I just went on to order the food.</li><li>But the food is the best at the finch and yonge location.</li><li>Service was good, food was good.</li><li>In terms of food, one of my friends ordered a chicken katsu which did not come with the sauce, and we had to tell them to take it back and add the sauce back.</li><li>The food itself is great, very flavorful and spicy just like I expect it to be.</li><li>The food itself was very tasty but there were some downsides.</li><li>The food was good and was quick considering the number of people we had.</li><li>I enjoyed their food but after this terrible service, they turned me off and I will not be returning.</li><li>TL; DR:- waited 30 minutes for food that never came- had to ask for menus, tea, and side dishes on three separate occasions- rude and passive aggressive waitress who said, and I quote, `` what do you need ?''- incompetent manager who made poor excuses rather than admitting mistakes- turned a loyal customer into an frustrated Yelp reviewer in one night.</li><li>Super fast service and food, in and out restaurant.</li><li>They food is pretty decent, I usually have the pork bone soup, the mackerel with tofu soup or the bulgogi in soup.</li><li>The Food is amazing I 've gotten so many dishes there ...</li><li>Conclusion: 3/5 stars I come back for the food but since I 've found out about Oh Geul Boh Geul I have n't been back since ( they have even more sides !!).</li><li>The only reason I gave 2 stars was because the food was okay and not terrible.</li><li>Ok food ...</li><li>The food is delicious though and good price for it.</li><li>I really enjoy dining in Nak Won, the service sucks sometimes but the food makes up for it for sure.</li><li>To summarize: delicious food with crappy service.</li><li>I did notice that the service is slipping a bit, but I feel that like in most Asian restaurants, this is somewhat normal ( cheap quick food, with low service).</li><li>The food is bland but worst of all the service is horrible.</li><li>In short, decent food but terrible horrible service.</li><li>Service is part of the experience at a restaurant and it not just about food.</li><li>There are other restaurant that serve good food and have great service for good prices.</li><li>Decent food, awful service, not coming again.</li><li>I had to stand up and stare her down outside our room so she would remember that we were still here waiting for our food.</li><li>So I 'm sad that one of my favorite staples in Young and Finch is no longer on my go-to list, but hopefully if they revamp the service and food in the future I can come back with an empty stomach ready to chow!</li><li>TTC accessible and the food is very affordable.</li><li>The food is edible but not great- the jajangmyeon tastes super watery and bland, the kamjatang is really oily and also bland ... basically the food here is bland and tastes cheaply made, but edible for a quick meal or for an after-drinking binge.</li><li>The food is edible but not great- the jajangmyeon

overall terrible service and disrespect for customers marred it all.</li><li>The fact was that my friend went in and ordered food earlier and I came after her so that waitress didnt know I ordered food.</li><li>The fact was that my friend went in and ordered food earlier and I came after her so that waitress didnt know I ordered food.</li><li>Just because my food was ordered later and didnt come up she thought I didnt order anything.</li><li>The sides and food cost is what keeps me coming back.</li><li>However, the food is pretty good here.</li><li>Food is very salty with no flavor. would not return.</li><li>LOVE! if you like korean food, dont come here! terrible food and awful services!</li><li>If you really want korean food, you might as well cook it yourself.</li><li>I recommend this place for their food and not their service ( waiters are fast, but not very friendly nor patient- I do n't know if they are burnt out or what, but they never look very happy) ...</li><li>I, for one, do n't really mind ( my focus is on the food) but keep in mind if service is important to you.</li><li>Decent place for affordable, comforting food with fairly quick service.</li><li>The dishes are inexpensive and the food is tasty.</li><li>Terrible service and ridiculous long wait for food.</li><li>However the food is decent and still at decent prices, great for fast eating at a good price.</li><li>The food is pretty good ( but I 've had some Korean friends say otherwise) and the prices are excellent.</li><li>Even though the food here is pretty good I doubt I can put up with the exceptionally bad service for another visit.</li><li>Bad food, expensive ( much of our $ 55 bbq kalbi was bone and sinew), and mandatory tip for extremely bad service.</li><li>The only downside is the amount of food you get.</li><li>Other than that the food is very good and the area is very spacious.</li><li>Bad service bad food and overpriced.</li><li>The food is tasteless and the plate of food I had for takeout was 90% rice and not good.</li><li>Very spacious with lots of seating and quicker to get certain food items like babaganoush or other dips as they now prepackage them daily and have them ready to go at the cash.</li><li>Food Quality &amp; Price: I ordered a 1/2 Chicken Shawarma wrap which comes with a soup/salad, I opted for Caesar.</li><li>Despite being `` fast food'', if you eat in, the staff will bring you your order and check in once in a while to see how you 're doing.</li><li>Overall: For about $ 10 a person, it definitely beats out any kind of food court or fast food options nearby for health, variety and atmosphere.</li><li>I 've been many times and have been pleased with all the food I 've tried from the refreshing lemonana drink to the chicken shawarma to the lamb and the Greek salad.</li><li>The food looked good but it was lacking in flavour.</li><li>Not soft as a Laffa should be, if you have n't realized yet I 'm a big fan of famous Laffa but their food is very very good!</li><li>The food is terrific as is the service.</li><li>Food is okay but the service def takes it even further down a notch.</li><li>It 's not groundbreaking food but it 's consistent and good.</li><li>You order at the counter and a serve/runner brings you your food.</li><li>I only put 4 stars, as I 'm not a fan of pressured up-sells ... which I felt they did ... but the food was still delicious.</li><li>I liked the atmosphere and the food looked quite good, decided to do take out.</li><li>Fantastic food cool place excellent manager `` Pending review As some of you already know, form following my posts, my wife and I are world travelers and foodies.</li><li>There was a line up, all 3 times ( yes we have returned twice since our first experience and plan to come back again!) that we came which is a testimony to the excellent tasty food.</li><li>I have certain food allergies and the manager was terrific in firstly checking all ingredients for me and then following up with us personally ensuring that our order was done right ..</li><li>The food was terrific.</li><li>I 've been to the one at Bathurst and steeles, and they compare relatively the same in food quality.</li><li>Serving incredibly fresh middle eastern food.</li><li>Highly recommended, good staff, quick service, good food.</li><li>The food was soooo good!</li><li>Overall, the delay in our meals was definitely not a good first impression for us but the food quality was pretty good.</li><li>I 've been to this location several times and love the food but I have an issue with the staff.</li><li>The first time I went there I LOVED the food and have kept going back.</li><li>Even though it was busy, we did not have to wait long for our food.</li><li>I have always gotten the laffa wrap at the Queen location and I was expecting the same thing, however when the food came I was extremely DISSAPPOINTED.</li><li>If you want to try the real MEVAME food make the trip down to Queen Street where you will try their food at its best.</li><li>The food is delicious but the people are goofs.</li><li>But hey the food is great so I keep coming back ... urg.</li><li>Decently good food, not worth the price.</li><li>The issue ... took 40 minutes to get our food !!</li><li>Had to go looking for the meal 3 times &amp; finally we got the food but we had to leave cause lunch is only 1hr !!</li><li>I can say the flavour &amp; quality was there for the food.</li><li>I would do this again but at a different time of day without the time restrictions of lunch. new location at York Mills expect long waits even though it 's `` express'' 1st time I was there- my bill was wrong but the food was good 2nd time- I did n't get a chance to taste my order cuz by the time I got home, realize I got someone else 's order- so pissed off with this $ 6 order that I paid $ 25 for !!</li><li>Great food and atmosphere.</li><li>Personally I do n't like a lot of oil on my vegetables so I ask for them to go easy on the oil However, I do enjoy the food here a lot and would recommend it but make sure you get your wrap to your liking and ask for additional toppings if desired.</li><li>Great food!</li><li>Food is good, but I really appreciate the service and for the value of the food you are getting in this area, it probably is the best.</li><li>Food is good, but I really appreciate the service and for the value of the food you are getting in this area, it probably is the best.</li><li>In terms of price I have to admit that they are one of the best in the GTA and the portions are massive as they really do not cheap out on the quantity of food they provide.</li><li>Is it the best food I have ever had, no, but it gets the job done and is very satisfying especially given that it is in the north york area where there are really only 3 good asian ( chinese particular) restaurants which includes Tin Tin Congee, Hakka and Noodle on Finch.</li><li>The food was much better than expected.</li><li>The food was fresh and fried well--crispy and not left to drown in sauces for hours.</li><li>Whenever I got to a specific type of restaurant, I seem to have a particular food to judge whether I might like a place.</li><li>The food is great!</li><li>The servers are very polite and the food arrives unexpectedly quickly.</li><li>Love the food and service.</li><li>Impeccable food.</li><li>The food is very good and delicious.</li><li>I was really impressed by the quality of food and the level of service and entertainment.</li><li>I highly recommend Zaffron Restaurant to whomever is looking to throw a Persian style party of great food and fun.</li><li>The food ( both appetizers and main courses) was super tasty came in large portions.</li><li>On the good days, food is a little dry but good.</li><li>Delicious food!</li><li>We would like to return to eat at the restaurant as it looked very warm and inviting. the most low quality catering in persian catagory. we had party on persian new year and every one paid for the food to be cater through this place. the food was not even enough for everybody and the quality was bad.</li><li>We would like to return to eat at the restaurant as it looked very warm and inviting. the most low quality catering in persian catagory. we had party on persian new

well cooked and presented.</li><li>I 'm not an expert when it comes to Persian food, but I found the food to be quite good and satisfying.</li><li>The food and service here is amazing and I keep coming back for that reason.</li><li>Very good and decent food.</li><li>It was a good experience as I got to taste these unique food.</li><li>Food is consistently excellent.</li><li>Phenomenal food and service.</li><li>I judge Persian restaurants by their most basic food- koobideh and barg.</li><li>The food is decent.</li><li>The service was so so and the food left a lot to desire.</li><li>This place has really lost its edge been going for a long time but when fast food kabob take out is better you have to ask what 's going on.</li><li>Our waitress took away our food when we were half done !!</li><li>The food was great!</li><li>It was unfortunate that such a huge amount of food was suggested for lunch as well.</li><li>While the food was delicious- fresh, great, large portions ( as they should be for the price ...), clearly prepared with knowledge and ability- I am still unlikely to return because of how I felt after due to my incorrect expectations of meal size/price.</li><li>I did n't enjoy the food.</li><li>Food was very good in my opinion -- I have a sesame allergy and they were easily able to accommodate it when I ordered bread and so on.</li><li>I ate here today with one of my friends .... the food was okay nothing wrong with that.</li><li>I got approached on my way out by a servant asking how the food was ...</li><li>The food is very good ...</li><li>Anyway, nice atmosphere, good food and awesome staff!</li><li>Not a cheap place like Pardis at Yonge &amp; 16 but may be worth it because the food was very delicious.</li><li>When we asked the staff for help for how much food we should get, they provided us with terrible advice with proportions way off from what was realistically feasible to eat to get us to pay more money.</li><li>I highly recommend avoiding this place as the service gets an F, the price gets an F, and the quality of the food was a C. Called the restaurant to ask if it is possible to make reservation for 25 people.</li><li>Food was great, better then most Persian restaurants I have had in the Toronto area.</li><li>Outdated tables and chairs, very dark and unpleasant atmosphere ... the food is by far the worst persian food Ive had .... no taste at all.</li><li>Its very expensive for the food and service received.</li><li>Hero Burger is too expensive, the food is mediocre, even the bags are terrible.</li><li>The service is always good and the food always tastes fresh.</li><li>The food is awesome and the pop dispenser is cool.</li><li>I 've never had a problem with the staff or food.</li><li>I 've heard people complain about hairs in their food.</li><li>The atmosphere is nice and clean and they have a great pop dispenser, but the food was awful.</li><li>Let 's call it `` faster-than-average food.''</li><li>The food took a little longer than usual to arrive, but service was good and the food is exactly what you 'd expect.</li><li>Other than that, food taste good and fresh.</li><li>Food is good and toppings are fresh.</li><li>This location is bright and updated, great service and the food was good.</li><li>The food was served cold which is a big disappointment.</li><li>While the food here is n't anything particularly special, the consistency of the food keeps me coming back for more.</li><li>While the food here is n't anything particularly special, the consistency of the food keeps me coming back for more.</li><li>If I were to rate this restaurant on quality of food alone it would be a 3/5 overall, but the consistency of the food, large portions, big menu, and excellent service keeps me coming back for more and bumps it to a 4/5.</li><li>Overall the food was great and prices were very reasonable. would recommend this plce to family and friends.</li><li>I 've ordered through Just-eat, and it was disgusting food.</li><li>Very satisfying. satay on the road has been one of my family 's favorite restaurants since i was a kid. i remember coming here when i was ten and ordering the same thing that i get now, ten years later: cashew nut chicken with an order of steamed rice and the shrimp chips with peanut sauce. first of all, the food tastes delicious. i think there 's been one or two times out of the hundreds of visits to this place where the food tasted a little spicier than usual but other than that, it 's been consistently amazing for close to a decade. i 've had cashew nut chicken at other thai restaurants and it just does n't compare. i ca n't speak about most of their other food but from what i 've experienced they 've been by far the best tasting thai restaurant in and around toronto. the wait staff is quick and friendly for the most part which is great. the atmosphere of the restaurant is nice ... they just re-did it and although i have to say i prefer the original decor which had an authentic thai feel to it, their modern, contemporary approach to their new `` look'' is very pleasing to the eyes and enjoyable to dine at as well. the value of the food is great. my girlfriend and i come here for their lunch special almost every week at least once and have a full meal with a drink that leaves us satisfied for both taste and hunger for usually under $ 10, 15% tip included. how can you beat that ?

I 've been here a bunch of times and it 's pretty consistent, just basic food.</li><li>Here 's the breakdown of food ordered: Appetizers:* Soup of the Day- flavourful and hearty ( 7/10)* Caeser Salad- great flavours, fresh and crisp -- perfect steakhouse caeser ( 9/10)* Spinach Salad- fresh but left much to be desired in flavour ( 6/10) Mains:* Lamb Shank- cooked well and seasoned beautifully but arrived cold ( 7/10)* Chicken- arrived dry and cold but flavour had great potential ( 7/10)* Pasta- looked terrible ( sauce had crusted over) and fellow diner commented that it was one of the worst he 's had ( 4/10) Desserts were rather good, all sampled were 8/10.</li><li>Food was ok, but this is the last time I was there.</li><li>Overall a satisfying meal with good food.</li><li>On the other hand, outside of winterlicious, I 've had some great experiences dining here ( excellent seafood risotto) so I would have to say the food can be inconsistent at times.</li><li>We looked at the Price Fixe list of restaurants and decided on Trappers for the sole reason that the food they had looked good.</li><li>Was here for lunch while competing for Miss Universe Canada 2016- food was amazing and fresh.</li><li>This newly renovated My Sushi appears to be under new ownership because their food quality has risen incredibly.</li><li>The price is fair and the food was well prepared.</li><li>The presentation of the food is nothing special either, it 's sushi on a plate and you are expected to eat it not admire it.</li><li>The food was good considering the price ( $ 19.99 Mon-Thurs).</li><li>The food continued to come plate by plate as we settled into our small booth and I guess there was no harm in having breaks in between plates.</li><li>Food took forever to come .. my friend had to ask one of the waitresses if the food on the ledge was ours because it was sitting there for 10 min. The waiter was confused about our bill and had to reprint it 3 times.</li><li>Food took forever to come .. my friend had to ask one of the waitresses if the food on the ledge was ours because it was sitting there for 10 min.

But when it 's a hit it 's very good.</li><li>I would of never thought of going to a kosher restaurant for good falafel, but hands down their food was excellent.</li><li>So the breakdown on food: Falafel 's = very good, Sandwiches = ive had the tuna melt ( with feta cheese) and the tunisian to date which are both great.</li><li>However, the food is amazing.</li><li>But the food and falafel would n't be this good in Israel.</li><li>Food is amazing, especially their pizza.</li><li>The food is decent, the ordering system is messed up but if you want a slice of pizza, a falafel, a shakshuka, or a massive salad then is is your place.</li><li>Their food is great tasting and they have great presentation, but their service sucks.</li><li>They have a realy long line up, and this is very annoying ... the food is nice, but it 's always taking too long to get the food .....</li><li>They have a realy long line up, and this is very annoying ... the food is nice, but it 's always taking too long to get the food .....</li><li>The food is good but the service is sub par And there not appreciative of the customers In fact almost rude.</li><li>The food is not that great.</li><li>Food is pretty good, has like a Chinese/Guyanese twist to it .. not sure..</li><li>There was enough food to easily feed 3 people.</li><li>Great food and cheaply priced.</li><li>Their food satisfied a picky child and husband.</li><li>The food tastes reheated all the time.</li><li>Customer service is not that good but the food is too good but if you 're someone that the customer service affects.</li><li>I love the food here.</li><li>I dont think anyone who has eaten this food has ever not eaten it again.</li><li>Food was spoil and the owner was rude and did n't refund or replace it.</li><li>The food here is seriously outstanding!</li><li>Located in the Prince Hotel this place offers great food and a great show.</li><li>The food is priced at more upscale prices, but their food is extremely good.</li><li>The food is priced at more upscale prices, but their food is extremely good.</li><li>Its a small treat while watching the chef cook your food.</li><li>One large setback is the high prices they charge, which may not necessarily make up for the quality of the food.</li><li>Overall, between the service and the quality of the food I would skip this one.</li><li>Food is fine if it were a quarter the cost.</li><li>I went on two different occasions ( Aoi menu once and Sunday special menu the next time) and can sum up the quality of food I had for both times: 1.</li><li>It is a lot of food.</li><li>The food was delicious, the service really sucked.</li><li>There are several Teppanyaki restaurants in the area now ( two very close on Don Mills Road), and while most of the staff working in them are Chinese, and the food probably not quite as high quality, they are busy, and the overall experience is great.</li><li>Katsura would be great, and super busy if it maintained it position as a classy, quiet, high quality food and service restaurant ....</li><li>Then, I believe there was a change in ownership and the quality of the food went to the hole.</li><li>And now for the test- was the food still bad ?</li><li>I am glad to report, the food was delicious.</li><li>In addition to my dad and family, I am sure we were not the only customers the restaurant lost to bad food that was expensive.</li><li>The quality of food is absolutely there.</li><li>When the food is brought out, you can see the attention to detail- nothing is amiss.</li><li>It 's not a place i will go every month, but it is great for a special night out because I know the food &amp; quality is consistently great!</li><li>Best service and friendly staff and the food was very delicious.</li><li>Not only the chef did a great job in preparation of the meal, the presentation of the food and attending to all customers were done in a timely and professional manner. ( not to mention, It was very entertaining as well- see photos) It 's a little bit pricy but I think it 's very well worth it.</li><li>If the food was n't bad enough, the terrible service sealed the deal.</li><li>It would n't have been so bad, but with the screaming children and terrible food I could n't have escaped sooner!</li><li>I wish someone had given me the same advise, saving me $ 200, an evening of terrible food, and crappy ambiance.</li><li>Other than the volcano onion there was n't much of showman ship here ( popularized by a chain that has made this kind of food mainstream) and it ended up rather quickly.</li><li>All this would have been OK if the food was good but alas it did n't improve the impression.</li><li>The food was so bad I had to return my entree!</li><li>We have tried all of the tapanyakki places in Toronto and I would say This place is one of the worst and way over priced for the amount of food you get per order, the food is tasteless and you have to dip constantly in the sauce.</li><li>We have tried all of the tapanyakki places in Toronto and I would say This place is one of the worst and way over priced for the amount of food you get per order, the

out.</li><li>The food was okay; the steak was very tender but a bit bland.</li><li>Unfortunately, they are a little pricey, the service is good but not outstanding and the food is ok compared to other

really had nothing to do with the food.</li><li>Taste wise, the food is okay for a fast food take out joint.</li><li>It 's just not good enough for `` fast food''.</li><li>Ordered food to be delivered

to get cooked food.</li><li>Some food is being recycle for the next dish.</li><li>The food can be too much oily, dry or salty. the taste of that filipino food that you 're looking for is not there.</li><li>Food is terrible in flavour and quality, service is so-so instead of being perfect.</li><li>It 's clean, there 's a good number of available booths and tables, the food is fresh ( at least on Saturday morning it is) and you get free coffee if you dine in.</li><li>Ladies serving food were sweet and gladly gave us extra calabasa ( squash) and ampalaya ( bittermelon) upon request.</li><li>As I stood by the food counter I was not acknowledge by the 3 ppl working behind the counter.</li><li>And whoever that lady was working behind the cooked food counter should n't be

ordered our food.</li><li>Taste-wise, the food is alright.</li><li>It 's stomach-heavy food ( or well, the pizza and the breadsticks are). + 1 for real bacon in their Caesar salad.</li><li>The food is n't funky or fun in anyway but it 's filling and the restaurant environment is very casual.</li><li>I would probably give the food a higher rating if I had had one of their cakes which I 've hear is

very small, and the food took so long to come out.</li><li>Though the food and preparation itself was good, the quality of the mussels themselves are not too good.</li><li>Though I am tempted to give this a 3 as well because the food was n't up to snuff.</li><li>Not to mention the food, which was amazing, had the Cuban sandwich, which was a ton of delicious pork on a soft ciabatta roll.</li><li>Once we placed our orders, the food took around 20 minutes to come out.</li><li>Really enjoyed the food, as well as the service provided by Sarah and a gentleman ( who I did n't catch the name: P).</li><li>I 've only been there for breakfasts, and there is always excellent service in the mornings and great food!</li><li>The price is cheap considering it 's on Yonge Street. great

affordable.</li><li>The food was good, the restaurant 's ambience was great, beautifully decorated, and the service was great!</li><li>Kinda ruined the overall experience, but the food made up for it.</li><li>The food is good- I recommend ALL of the desserts.</li><li>We waited very long to get our food, very long to get coffee refills, and very long to get our bill.</li><li>I 'd prefer to not go back but somehow my friends usually choose to meet at a Symposium Cafe for brunch- likely for convenience of location vs the food and service.</li><li>The food was alright, but nothing

food tasted as it always does .... but I 'll figure something else out next time! what is the deal with this mcdonalds ? i only go here because sometimes i work really late and its around the corner from my shop. they have the slowest service out of all mcdonalds ive ever been to. and on top of that, which i find ridiculous, they also charge more than other mcdonalds .. how ??? and when you get your order of fries, they NEVER fill it up, its always HALF. the food tastes as you would expect, but this place must be struggling financially to charge more than other mcdonalds, and only fill your fries HALF of what you should get. if you dont mind getting ripped off, then go here, otherwise go to the mconalds on keele just south of lawrence.</li><li>The food tasted as it always does .... but I

rude.</li><li>Ordered take out in the afternoon while i was on lunch break and it took about 15 mins to get food.</li><li>The food here brought back memories of my visits to the land of my parents and I felt so at home among some fellow country-men.</li><li>All the food has a homemade taste which gives it that much more authenticity.</li><li>It still took a long time to get our food.</li><li>After a while though, the food starts to taste the same ...</li><li>Anyways, we ordered a platter between the two of us and it was a MASSIVE amount of food.</li><li>But none of the food was especially good.</li><li>All the meat was dry and the best meat was the wings, but that was even fairly average. they do have free refills on drinks and the server was rather attentive and nice. but the food and the atmosphere does n't cut it for me to want to come back.</li><li>The service was slow and when they asked how the food was, I told them the ribs were not easy to eat and too hard, they told me it 's because of the cut .... did n't offer to comp since I only touched one, or apologize either.</li><li>It 's pretentious and it makes no sense in that the Memphis theme has no connection to the people running the place, but the food was good and the beer was cheap.</li><li>I 'm no expert on southern style food or smoked meats.</li><li>I do n't even know where the smoked part was in the food and should not be called a smoke house.</li><li>I could n't finish my food and they asked me if I wanted to take the rest home.</li><li>Beer makes me happy. this was ok --- SUMMARY --- Plus 's: good place to hang out, decent food, Minus 's: sitting on the patio means breathing all the car exhaust from the cars on Yonge street --- MORE DETAILS --- we choose a platter for two ... it consisted of: very tender chicken ( i picked it up and a piece of meat fell off- SO TENDER) first time i had cornbread- it looked burnt on the bottom, so i just ate the top part not bad ( it would n't ' be my first choice) pulled pork was ok chicken wings were fairly good beef brisket was pretty good .. ribs were kinda dry ... in the end everything kinda tasted the same. fries were good- not too salty. stepping in, the restaurant itself is nice, there are booths or table seating indoors. the main window is a garage front that opens into the patio area facing yonge st. interior has exposed beam ceilings and there 's many nostalgic memorabilia decorated throughout. we ordered a couple of things from the menu 1. spaghetti with beef brisket- yeah i know an experimental dish but i was feeling like spaghetti and if the brisket was good -- you know that would been amazing. unfortunately the brisket was covered in tomato sauce so I could n't taste it in it 's full glory or not ..</li><li>He apologized and had the nerve to say `` I 've never heard any complaints before'' ... so he 's in denial about how bad the food is, or he 's never read Yelp .... wow.</li><li>The staff was very courteous and I like the atmosphere, but the food left something to be desired.</li><li>Luckily the food I ordered was above average ( its no beale street smokehouse though).</li><li>The food as pretty good but we did n't find it exceptional considering it costs a bit more than other places.</li><li>Facts: Good food.</li><li>The atmospher may seems little lousy but the food are neat and high quality.</li><li>The food here was not bad but the dining experience left a bad taste in my mouth.</li><li>Overall, food was okay.</li><li>BBQ portions are for two and if you order the combo with the soup, it 's more than enough food for two.</li><li>I 'm not Korean, but i can defintely enjoy the authenticity of the food.</li><li>This is a great homey spot with no frills, just great food and great people.</li><li>Great service and tasty food!</li><li>And he wo n't try to sell you too much food.</li><li>If you 're loooking for a cozy authentic family style restaurant with amazing food this is your place.</li><li>Overall the service is amazing and the food is filling and delicious!</li><li>He even showed us the proper cooking technique for table BBQ, and I 'm sure it helped our food taste better.</li><li>Owner is exceptionally nice and thoughtful- taking all the time: the world to explain every thing to you and following up to see if the food was satisfactory.</li><li>Ordered a whole bunch of food to share including: 1) Pork Bone Soup- $ 9.99 2) Samgyeopsal- BBQ Bacon and soup ( for 2 ppl)- $ 32.99 3) &amp; 4) Bibimbap- $ ?? 5) Side dishes- Free 1) Pork bone soup is really good, the consistency of the soup is slightly thicker than what you would get from any other place.</li><li>All in all the food is pretty good, I would give it 3.5*.</li><li>Good food, but even better service.</li><li>I was with a bunch of Korean BBQ novices ( myself mostly included) so the owner took his time to explain the menu, the food, the culture, and more.</li><li>Food was great, and they were happy to make suggestions for things to order and in what amount.</li><li>It 's small and simple, with really good food.</li><li>I quite liked it and thought the food was actually really delicious.</li><li>Service is friendly, food is quick and always so delicious.</li><li>The staff was friendly and quick to take your order, however once your food is served you wo n't see your server again until you are done your meal.</li><li>The food is a bit expensive for the serving size you get.</li><li>Overall, we had a nice time and the food is good, it 's just not worth what you pay.</li><li>The food is good- 4 stars The service- 3 stars Clean and tidy- 4 stars Bathroom- I have n't checked.</li><li>I am a regular at this restaurant and I really think that their food is great.</li><li>What I love so much about this place is that I do n't feel sick after eating their food- ( like that MSG sick feeling).</li><li>The food is good.</li><li>The food is great so I 'd definitely go again.</li><li>On to the food- gotta love the fruit flies following my spicy eggplant from the kitchen onto my table.</li><li>Everything was greasy and under seasoned; dim sum wrappers way too thick and by bringing out all the food to the table within 5 minutes, dishes got cold and inedible.</li><li>There is a good selection in the menu but food is not great if you are a dim sum fan.</li><li>4 plates shared amongst 5 adults actually was enough food.</li><li>$ 20- $ 25 per person, excluding tax or tip) the quality of the food is definitely not worth.</li><li>I understand that the restaurant is located in the expensive Bayview Village so it has to make enough money for the rent, but the food has to be equally good to justify that.</li><li>Also note that, as a previous Yelper pointed out, this establishment has a history of failing food safety inspections, and one of the inspections forced the restaurant to close for 10 days.</li><li>Food was ok.</li><li>The food and the service are excellent.</li><li>Sitting in the middle of the room, the food in the centre was really dim We came for Dim Sum on Sunday afternoon.</li><li>In the wasteland that is Keele &amp; Steeles, Genji Sushi is a welcome oasis of good quality food.</li><li>Food was fantastic.</li><li>My buddy recommended the spicy bulgogi lunch special and I trust his food recommendations so I went with that.</li><li>Food is excellent.</li><li>The service is great and the food is delicious!</li><li>The food quality is also decent.</li><li>First time I came here after school, being in an area full of small businesses and not much of an attraction elsewhere, genji is one that stands out for sure not only in appearances but the food is amazing.</li><li>Great food and good service at a reasonable cost.</li><li>This little gem is definitely worth the drive, I would love to keep it my little secret, but the food, atmosphere, &amp; service is too good to not share!</li><li>I dont care how good your food is!</li><li>Nice interior with great food and good service.</li><li>Service and food is great.</li><li>The food was good and the service was good too.</li><li>The food is fresh and really good.</li><li>The prices however, are slightly on the pricier side, but with the great food, service, and ambience, I found it worth it.</li><li>I would go there again just to enjoy the Japanese style dining area but not so much for the food.</li><li>Prices are very reasonable, great attention to detail and presentation &amp; most importantly the quality of the food is superb!</li><li>Food is always great.</li><li>Quality of food is excellent!</li><li>This restaurant serves high quality food.</li><li>These were great- absolutely no complaints with the food.</li><li>The food was really good and nicely presented, the decor was really pretty and the bathrooms were clean.</li><li>Very small place but food is very fresh!</li><li>The food is amazing and fresh and the staff is great.</li><li>The food is good but not worth it as the culture of the managing staff is not generous.</li><li>Staff is unpleasant service is slow and they never offer compliments for waiting customers Too be because the food is actually good.</li><li>Mysteriously I was n't given the napkin + fork + knife package when my food was served.</li><li>However I forgive this oversight and wo n't deduct a star (*) because the waitress was fast and response, and the food was tasty. (* Note: My standard rating is 4 stars, not 5.</li><li>The food was sub-par, compared to your typical place that serves burgers and fries, just with a bit more selection in wings, and beer.</li><li>Good food!</li><li>The food is standard pub food, but delicious.</li><li>I have tried wings here more than any other food in my life.</li><li>The food consists of the menu served downstairs.</li><li>Our food also took awhile to come.</li><li>My favorites food vise are hot n ' honey wings, sweet potato fries and lots and lots of onion chips.</li><li>Service, food and atmosphere Amazing!</li><li>The price, flavour, and variety of heat is great, and I would probably go again if it came up, but only for the food.</li><li>I used to be a waitress and I know that a smile, albeit terrible food or atmosphere will go a long way in making someone 's day brighter.</li><li>Loved the food and the service just dislike the seating arrangement.</li><li>The food here is great ( for bar food) and their famous dill ranch dip is simply amazing.</li><li>Cheap food.</li><li>Good place, solid food and good service we go there a lot for UFC nights but try to go to the bar upstairs much better atmosphere than the ground floor, better service and even the food.</li><li>Good place, solid food and good service we go there a lot for UFC nights but try to go to the bar upstairs much better atmosphere than the ground floor, better service and even the food.</li><li>We were at the National this Saturday with friends and had an awesome time: delicious food, friendly service, great live music ( all night long !!!), and a wonderful surprise of a Las Vegas style show, which was mouth dropping.</li><li>The food was bountiful and served up dutifully by the banquet hall servers in a never ending succession of courses.</li><li>Truthfully I found the food to be really heavy handed and too meaty for my liking, but hubby was really digging the Sodium/Carnivore-fest.</li><li>I wo n't go into too much more specifics as I feel the previous review did National great justice, so I 'll say if you like really hearty food that is heavily carnivorous and have an appreciation for the ironic, than by all means National Restaurant will have you toasting the Russians with zeal.</li><li>I was impressed by how food was served because I 've never seen this before.</li><li>About food .... ...............:)) we did n't go home hungry with the $ 85 menu.:)) The stuff was good .. no complains about them ....</li><li>That was even more frustrating .. we were waiting them to pack our food and then all of a sudden they started to sing all good latino songs one after the other ..</li><li>Last Saturday, I was given an opportunity to enjoy what many Russians and Eastern Europeans do on a weekend night: dress up in your best semi-formal outfit to enjoy copious amounts of food and watch a Las Vegas style show.</li><li>The term of `` overkill'' is n't a factor at National Restaurant, everything is done BIG: lots of food, lots of glitz and glamour, lots of fun.</li><li>The food: When we entered the main hall, I was astonished by the sight of food decorating the tables.</li><li>The food: When we entered the main hall, I was astonished by the sight of food decorating the tables.</li><li>I made an effort to try everything, though some I could n't resist sampling a few times, such as:- eggplant and tomato puree with loads of garlic- blinis with caviar- pickled cabbage, cucumbers and watermelon ( the latter being my new favourite!)- chicken kebabs- shredded chicken salad- spiced mushrooms- stuffed turkey neck- bread pastry ( almost phillo) with stuffed cheese Since the food was already laid out when we arrived, we began eating at 8pm, washing it all down with vodka and wine.</li><li>I came here with my family and the food was amazing !!</li><li>The food quality here is pretty good, lots of side dishes and delicious garlic bread to accompany your main course.</li><li>The food was very decent.</li><li>I 'm rating based on the food, which is good.</li><li>The food was a solid 4 stars.</li><li>Service was excellent and the food was terrible.</li><li>Food portions were quite large but quality of food on the low scale.</li><li>There is a section where the chef cooks and flips the food in front of you at a threatening distance .. what 's that called again ?</li><li>The food was average.</li><li>The food is great, not the best Japanese food but for the price I pay, I 'm more than satisfied.</li><li>You get so much food, including dessert and appetizer ... this place just rocks my world.</li><li>I`m giving it 1.5 stars because the service was decent but the food and atmosphere could be improved ( the place looked old and not well kept).</li><li>As for the food I never go home disappointed ..</li><li>Their food and service sucks.</li><li>It took forever to get our food and some of our party had almost finished their meal before others even got their food!</li><li>It took forever to get our food and some of our party had almost finished their meal before others even got their food!</li><li>The food is very good and the prices are even better.</li><li>Granted, I 've never experienced the horrific food or service that everyone else seems to agree on.</li><li>The food is n't anything godawful.</li><li>I mean, just give me my food and my water refills and I 'm sated.</li><li>We decided to go teppenyaki, sitting at a square table with a grill in the middle and a great view of the food being prepared.</li><li>However the managers were better at serving and the food was overall pretty good.</li><li>Is there a new trend towards expensive crappy food with bad service ?</li><li>Food was mediocre plus I was not really in the mood to enjoy it after what has happened.</li><li>I should have probably read the reviews on yelp before going to the restaurant .. but I did n't .. .. btw before i get started why is there filtered reviews ? maybe i missed something ..; anyways went here for lunch with a co-worker because its close to the office .. the decor is okay and we were quickly seated but thats as good as it got .. none of the staff make eye contact, everything is slow even tho the establishment was n't busy, there was just no importance on quality .. we ordered one of the lunch specials, the pricing is good, but I learned a long time ago, you get what you pay for, so for $ 7 to $ 15 you can get a salad, appetizer, sushi, chicken/beef, dessert, etc the food was cold and really average, they forgot our sushi and when we pointed it out to the manager he said he would take it off our bill .. a whole $ 1.20 ?? for 6 sushi rolls .. like i said u get what u pay for .. my co-worker, who is from hong kong blasted the manager, but he was no help ... so i will never go back .. but the experience got me back to using yelp!;).</li><li>The food is not great but the price is ok.</li><li>Mediocore food and terrible service.</li><li>The servers took forever to come around to take our order, and only refilled our tea once after waiting half an hour. the person who seemed to be the owner tried clearing the plates off our table, but my friend was n't even finished her food!</li><li>The service has a lot to be desired and the food is okay.</li><li>Thank goodness for good company .. flagging down our waitress was a pain .. and waiting for the food .. was just .. awful.</li><li>We have attended a couple of times and always enjoyed the food and the atmosphere which made the experience last night all the more disconcerting.</li><li>Food was OK but the service left much to be desired.</li><li>This place is close to home, and the food is passable and cheap.</li><li>The quality of the food is mediocre but passable, the service is awful but if you 're lucky you 'll get a teppanyaki chef that will put on a good show for your group.</li><li>It 's one thing to have bad service, but it 's another when you have to ask 10 times for the servers to bring you the food that you ordered.</li><li>Even though the food is n't bad, the mannerism of the servers and the chaos is very off-putting.</li><li>The food is sooo bad!</li><li>Hope they would charge 5-10 $ more but serve somewhat eatable food !!</li><li>The food quality was very good and we were satisfied with our meal.</li><li>A solid 3 stars for this place, which is fine when you do n't need to have fancy food.</li><li>Bento boxes had quite a lot of food.</li><li>While the food is definitely not the best I 've ever had, it was basically the same as many Chinese places, which was decent enough.</li><li>Ice cream The food in general was average where something things were good and somethings were just average but reasonably priced for what you are getting.</li><li>Keep in mind that the place is your typical Chinese owned Japanese restaurant and I find that a lot of Chinese owned Japanese restaurants serve mediocre food but are very reasonably priced and focus more on giving customers value for their money than a place like Zen or Aoyama who serve a lot better quality but are at a higher price point.</li><li>There is also another section to the restaurant where the chefs make food at your table.</li><li>It took forever for our orders to be taken, and the food took a while to come.</li><li>Also, a lot of the servers were sending food to the wrong tables, there seemed to be a general confusion with most of them.</li><li>Overall, the food is okay, the service is slow, the servers are unorganized and the place can get loud and crowded.</li><li>A large selection of food on the menu, many things to try.</li><li>However, the quality of the food is not that good.</li><li>Amazing food, great prices, good service ... arranged a group of 12 people, and they were very accommodating.</li><li>If you are at a teppanyaki table, it 's great, and watching the chefs prepare the food is fun.</li><li>Just one thing that could be improved: the waiting for the food .-. Like it take quite a while.</li><li>But overall the food was worth the wait.</li><li>Enough food for a king, but for 12.95!</li><li>The food is fantastic, the portions are ridiculous and the prices are out of this world.</li><li>The food was passable, nothing special, and the service was friendly but terrible.</li><li>Astonishingly rude staff ( especially female front hostess), mediocre food, decent prices.</li><li>The food is cheap, but the service lacks a lot.</li><li>$ 16.50 for a bento box with 2 mains ( short ribs + a teriyaki fish/beef/chicken) The quality of food, is okay.</li><li>Our food was also served with a side of Appalling Service.</li><li>Tako still gets a passing grade as the food is mildly bearable.</li><li>Food was n't good.</li><li>Edit: so you took the time to review how long I took to get food and eat and leave.</li><li>Here 's what went wrong- food took a very long time come to the table and it was cold.</li><li>The place is extremely dirty, the food is questionably and definitely microwaved, and the servers did n't have their customer service training.</li><li>- What made Wimpy 's great &amp; what can once more, is Fantastic food, service &amp; the feeling of being in a happy 50 's diner !!!!</li><li>I have come to this conclusion, its edible, but lots of food does not mean great food.</li><li>I have come to this conclusion, its edible, but lots of food does not mean great food.</li><li>I expect that people who do n't have much expectation for diner food, service/atmosphere, would be okay with this place, but that 's not me.</li><li>The food itself is what you 'd expect, nothing mind-blowing, but satisfying.</li><li>The endless options of online games and the convenience of food at the same place. anyhow I happened upon this 24 hour diner. it was practically empty at 10pm but picked up and up, and soon at 11pm it was about half full. the food was well portioned, the potatoes were just ... meh not bad. but felt out of place taste wise. pretty good stuff.</li><li>Good service and good food.</li><li>The food always comes quick and the staff is always friendly.</li><li>Blarring tv, kids screaming cold eggs and complaining waiters Used to be good about 3 yrs ago and all the noise and drama was worth waiting in line on a Saturday for the food but the food got terrible too.</li><li>Blarring tv, kids screaming cold eggs and complaining waiters Used to be good about 3 yrs ago and all the noise and drama was worth waiting in line on a Saturday for the food but the food got terrible too.</li><li>Something in this food is not agreeing with us, the one common denominator we shared was having their coffee with the 10% milk.</li><li>When the food is good, it 's good and it 's fair for the price.</li><li>Typical diner- good food and very good service.</li><li>But my food is always hot, fresh and no complications.</li><li>No matter how busy it is, the staff will do anything in their power for food to come out in time.</li><li>I have been here twice and each time I had a good experience with the staff and food.</li><li>The food and service was also great from our waitress.</li><li>The service was very slow and on top of that, the food was cold and not tasty at all.</li><li>We came here at 12:30 am after a night of drinking, and we were dining with about 3 other full tables and man did the food come quick!</li><li>If its fast, greasy food you are looking for, without all the frills then stop into this location.</li><li>The food was n't anything that was n't expected, but I ca n't say it was great food.</li><li>The food was n't anything that was n't expected, but I ca n't say it was great food.</li><li>I 'm used to diner food in the US and Emily 's is right on par.</li><li>They 're always eager to clean off your table once they notice you 've stopped eating .. first, we got a table that was highly uncomfortable, the seats felt shitty that we were/felt sunken in .... space is cramped .... just not comfy at all ... and food sucked .. i ordered a eggs florentine ... equivalent to a vegetarian eggs benedict, basically the same hollandaise sauce .... but it was o so shitty ... my friend ordered a club sandwich ... the bread looked like whole wheat wonderbread .. c-r-a-p. ( review for the bathurst &amp; sheppard location).</li><li>This location used to be reliable for consistently decent food but based on my consumer experience on Thursday and my friends on Friday- the quality of food has gone way down.</li><li>This location used to be reliable for consistently decent food but based on my consumer experience on Thursday and my friends on Friday- the quality of food has gone way down.</li><li>Peameal bacon on Eggs Benedict was so chewy it was unpalatable, Turkey bacon looked like pasty white mutant food ... stiff and stale as a board.</li><li>My fork had a very sticky mush on the back that was not cleaned off right unfortunately I did not notice it till I was done eating when I flipped around my fork and I know it was not from my food because it was not any type of food it turned me right off my table was sticky and my waiter was not very welcoming and seemed like she did not care and she would continue talking to her friends and yeilling out sit anywhere when someone walked in when I was finished eating I was waiting for her for about 15 min before she actually stopped talking to friends and came over and asked if I was finished and if I would like anything else the food was slapped together I understand its a 24 hour wimpys and you have to serve and make a lot of food in a fast paste time but it could of been neater and cooked a bit more.</li><li>My fork had a very sticky mush on the back that was not cleaned off right unfortunately I did not notice it till I was done eating when I flipped around my fork and I know it was not

quality food.</li><li>Food was ok, nothing spectacular.</li><li>Decent food, friendly staff and cool atmosphere.</li><li>Food is great assuming you keep your expectations at what it is!</li><li>Good food, service and vibes.</li><li>The food is not to die for exceptional but it is good.</li><li>The servers know their food and are always happy to recommend items on the menu.</li><li>The Highlights:- This place is gorgeous both inside and out- Ample amount of seating for both small and big groups- The waiters are all very professional and seasoned in the food serving business ( you wo n't find your neighbor 's 16 year old kid working here)- Free hors d' oeuvres at the start of your meal ( pickles, olives, cottage cheese, and garlic bread)- Reasonable prices ( all main entrees come with a salad or soup of the day ... a good amount too)- Parking is a plenty and free- Desserts are made on site and delicious ... and you can get it for a low price- Bottomless coffee for $ 1.75- Quiet so you can carry on a conversation with your dining companions I will definitely be back.</li><li>Just go to the Keg up the street where you get better food for lower prices.</li><li>The staff is friendly and the food is fantastic. i try and have all my business functions here because they always make me look good.</li><li>Alright, onto the food.</li><li>When an order of steak is over $ 40, I expect the food to at least be done right.</li><li>At that point I just told him to get us our bill because we were in no mood for eating after this treatment and I was n't going to pay for the food they took away from us and that we did n't eat.</li><li>The food was spectacular and portions were very generous.</li><li>To paraphrase Bill Murray in his famous one-liner in Lost in Translation- what sort of restaurant makes you want to cook your own food ?</li><li>Cheaper, better food, and better service.</li><li>The food was pretty good.</li><li>Anyhow, the food, considering the price, was n't the best thing ever.</li><li>Complimentary bread and finger food ( olives, pickles, etc) are a nice touch.</li><li>I used to think that I could n't like this restaurant, as the food is `` traditional'' ( i.e. outdated, boring) steak + seafood throwing-everything-under-a-broiler type, and I am not super comfortable having senior citizens wait on me.</li><li>Ordered the duncan deluxe appetizer for two as well ( $ 55) once again have your food reflect the price you 're charging your customers.</li><li>Food was surprisingly well-priced too all things considering.</li><li>Food was fine.</li><li>I was invited on an occasion with some very nice family friends and honestly, I 'm going to put it out there that the food was good.</li><li>In any case, although the food was good, it 's not like I ca n't get that same quality somewhere else in Toronto ( that also has great service).</li><li>The restaurant has great potential but it 's major flaw is the food.</li><li>The food I have to say was outstanding.</li><li>I would give the food 5 stars.</li><li>It was a busy Saturday night so food was slow to come out.</li><li>We come here for the food, not the décor, not the starchiness, and it does not disappoint.</li><li>Will continue to come; even under different management, the food is still good.</li><li>It was a rocky relationship for sure and it was for Valentines day dinner a few years back and I have to say it was truly an amazing experience ... and the food was ok too lol.</li><li>Sometimes it is the company and not the food that makes a great place.</li><li>Fair food.</li><li>The food here I would not give 5 stars but the experience and the beauty of the building makes up for it!</li><li>We ordered a prime rib ( my fav!) wanted it rare, but it came out kind of medium-ish and got a seafood platter ( $ 65) which was not that amazing, 1 lobster tail, 1 jumbo shrimp, 2 oysters Rockefeller, some scallops, king crab/Alaskan king crab legs. sounds like a lot, but it is n't cause it all fits into one plate! but anyways overall the price is fair and the food is good, just not the best.</li><li>Excellent food especially the desert, the chief cooks in front you!</li><li>I have been a regular at the Duncan House for years and have always loved their food, service, and the overall atmosphere.</li><li>Not many places that make food table side ( caesar salad and cherry jubilee) too, which also add a unique touch your guests will appreciate.</li><li>The other reason is that it takes forever for your food to arrive.</li><li>By the time it comes, yore going to have been starving, which just adds to the food 's taste.</li><li>Personally I do n't want to have to wait for a long time to get my food, and I guess with such a huge establishment they have a lot of people to serve, and I get that.</li><li>Fantastic food and great atmosphere.</li><li>Although the ambience is great, the food was very mediocre and the wait staff pretty bad.</li><li>If our service and food was so poor on a slow night, can you even fathom a busy night ?</li><li>The food is very good.</li><li>I 'll first start off with the food, we were a group of 4 but not that hungry so all we ordered was 2 servings of pork belly and it was fairly a good amount, but the slices were really thin ( a little bit thicker than bacon) and came with soup of ur choice ( choose kimchi) food was ok.</li><li>HE TOOK IT FROM ME AND NEVER GAVE IT BACK! convenient location, average food at affordable price and cleaner than other korean restaurant in yonge and finch area. but i find nothing special and the food is too average. its not bad but its not good. but they have a large selection to choose from so if u have nowhere to go, its not a bad choice.</li><li>HE TOOK IT FROM ME AND NEVER GAVE IT BACK! convenient location, average food at affordable price and cleaner than other korean restaurant in yonge and finch area. but i find nothing

though.</li><li>My friends and I ( 5 of us) decided to have some Korean food here cuz apparently this restaurant is kinda popular ( and you have to wait in line at 9pm), it turns out the food is really mediocre here.</li><li>Probably wo n't be coming back here because of the food.</li><li>Pros: good service ( was n't too busy) variety of appetizers and good hotpot Cons: no major cons but food took some time.</li><li>The food was okay nothing spectacular.</li><li>3 stars for decent food and drinks.</li><li>One of my go-to Korean restaurants because the food here is cheaper than some other Korean places I 've been to.</li><li>I think this place is good value for the price, and the portions of the food are filling!</li><li>2 big tv on each end showing Korean soap opera which is great when your friend got bored with you or the food ...</li><li>We left most of them untouched and it is really rare for that to happen as my Yelp friend would never waste food.</li><li>The food was terrible and the service was really bad.</li><li>The food was great, but the service could be a lot better.</li><li>Food is very average, there 's nothing wrong with it except there 's been a few times here when it tasted like the dishes were n't as fresh.</li><li>Food was decent enough.</li><li>The food is good but nothing spectacular.</li><li>1 star off for just average food.</li><li>The food is good, but I prefer the Korean restaurants near by.</li><li>- Food was filling.</li><li>Cons:- The food was average.</li><li>None of their food strikes me as super amazing.</li><li>None of their food were bad either.</li><li>No complaints on the food:) Only reason I did n't give it a full 5 stars is because the heat was not on in the restuarant and the doors kept being opened, so everyone was freezing!</li><li>The food has always been decent, service was always subpar and there have been a few occasions where issues like `` you need to order a certain amount of table bbq to eat here'' happened, though this `` rule'' seems to be inconsistent.</li><li>People go to a restaurant for the convenience and food.</li><li>The food is decent.</li><li>The food was pretty standard/average and almost good.</li><li>I did n't really expect much from a restaurant like this so was happy and satisfied with the food and the price point I guess is relatively standard.</li><li>I do n't really know what I said to offend her so much but for that reason alone I will not be returning because the food was not worth the terrible attitude.</li><li>The food is just that good.</li><li>Food was good, friendly service here.</li><li>No amount of good food can make up for the `` service'' ( if any).</li><li>Me listing out these `` moments'' is not here to punish the staff that work here but to merely bring out the point that, good food is not sufficient for a successful restaurant.</li><li>It made it very hard to ladle out the food.</li><li>Went here a couple of times Pricey for what you are paying for There is only so much all you can eat stir fry one can eat Good selection of fresh food for the stirfry you are creating I think this place is more for the experience Getting to watch a teppan chef cook your food is essentially what you are paying for Nothing special but would go again.</li><li>I over ate fried greasy food.</li><li>This place is ok, provides lots of food and decent value for lunch.</li><li>The buffet also has a great selection of food and the desserts are great as well.</li><li>Their own `` make your own'' dish is still the same which is good but the food at the buffet was old and stale and almost inedible.</li><li>The choices of raw foods seemed smaller, there was little customizing options by way of seasonings and sauces, and food seemed ...</li><li>Although it is tough to know how your food will taste once you 've douced it in every sauce.</li><li>But then they also have a fairly large Chinese section with a few different types of food including dim sum.</li><li>Solid food, decent service, nice ambience, all you can eat, reasonable prices.</li><li>It 's not the best food in the city, but it 's good value and well worth a visit.</li><li>It 's still not the best buffet food in Toronto, but it 's definitely improved.</li><li>When it comes to the sauces a loud mouthed hostess lady was happy to scoop all kinds of liquids into my overflowing bowl of mounding food.</li><li>Is n't the reason you go to a restaurant is to eat food that is based off a recipe you do n't know and have it prepared for you ?</li><li>The cooks place the food on a searing hot drum and manipulate the food with long sticks.</li><li>The cooks place the food on a searing hot drum and manipulate the food with long sticks.</li><li>Food is good enough.</li><li>To start off, the food taste fresh but not many choices of raw items to choose from.</li><li>During my dinner, I went up to get more food when I saw a dead fly in the vegetables.</li><li>GREAT price, the food is good quality and very tasty.</li><li>Food-The food was awful.</li><li>Everything else was mediocre low grade food.</li><li>My cousin who has visited there a few times said this was the worst the food had ever tasted and I would have repeated.</li><li>I found it very annoying that I had to wait for everyone food to be prepared separately ( it 's a big grill, cook 2 meals at a time or more, its already prepared for the chef all he has to do is stir it and dump it onto a plate. ( it takes 2 minutes on average per plate so as the 5th in line ( someone was ahead of us) it was a good 10 minutes before he got to me).</li><li>Do n't know the name but their main thing is a build your own dish ( pick from a large assortment of veggies, meats and sauces give to chef who cooks it for you on this 6-8 for wide circular flat top stove) which is incredible ... and the food too.</li><li>Food is ok.</li><li>Overpriced buffet prices for subpar food.</li><li>Let 's start off with the cooked food, it lacked flavour and half the food was not fresh.</li><li>Let 's start off with the cooked food, it lacked flavour and half the food was not fresh.</li><li>The biggest let down was the price, $ 40 per person, way overpriced for the food that you are getting and the quality.</li><li>The rest of the food is rather disappointing.</li><li>I never take the time to review a restaurant, but the food I received was so bad I felt compelled to warn others.</li><li>This was by far the most revolting chinese food I have ever had in Toronto .. scratch that, it was the most revolting food I have ever had in my life. period.</li><li>I think it really made the experience, on top of the yummy food.</li><li>Wide selection on the grill-think stir fry but upgraded-although note to go easy on the chili paste if you are a spicy food lover like myself Wide selection of dim sum and appetizers, and great presentation, although some foods were not as authentic ( steamed veggie dumplings, kung pao fish, chicken fried rice) but guess they had to cater to different taste buds.</li><li>The food gets cooked on a large flat surface ( like a wok, only not round), but it definitely ai n't BBQ esque.</li><li>The wait staff had no problem offering utensils for us as the chopsticks were already on the table when we sat down, The food was ... spectacular !!</li><li>I started off with the grill part and the food was so fresh and there was so many options.</li><li>Even thought it was a slow Monday night, I could tell that even at mass capacity this place has the room ... and the food, to spare.</li><li>Food was cooked quickly however I felt the grill master added a tad too much water to the ingredients while cooking everything and watered down my sauces a little.</li><li>I always find it a bit difficult to rate places where you are in control of how your food tastes ...</li><li>The food had been awesome and the selection fantastic.</li><li>Went for lunch, was busy but never really waited on anything, not food or drinks.</li><li>It 's a huuuuuuge Chinese-Canadian fusion buffet with really tasty food -- everything from North American staples like chicken balls and chow mein to more authentic steamed scallion buns and dumplings.</li><li>I wish I could do half-stars, because I would like to give it more than a three because the food is just plain tasty.</li><li>The parts of the food that are not tasty are what take points off.</li><li>Overall, pretty good food especially if you 're really hungry- it is all you can eat after all.</li><li>The food was very good, both pre cooked and cook-yourself.</li><li>I like the fact even it is buffet, the food is so fresh.</li><li>Although I would n't say the buffet part is terrible I definitely think it 's forgettable and as Lan pointed out the dinner price points are a rip off ( at $ 22 a person) especially when you consider that it 's the same food!</li><li>Their cooked food options are n't that great so the second time I just stuck to making bowls.</li><li>The food is fresh, everything is clean.</li><li>The food was great and selection of sauces, and additives to whatever meat you were having was enough.</li><li>They will come to you if you have more than 1 plate so be on the look out for them taking your fantastic hard laboured collection of food.</li><li>Not bad for the amount of food you get. p.s This is NOT salad-eating-girl friendly.</li><li>If you can pack it, your in. xoxo M. The food is fresh and the kids love it here.</li><li>They get to make their food and we test their food in the master chef style.</li><li>The buffet and salad bar is three rows of mostly Chinese-ish food with the mandatory french fries and caesar salad for the fussy children.</li><li>Food is good.</li><li>There was a nice selection of food.</li><li>Despite what one person mention the process of selecting your food is pretty easy, they have `` Chef Mixes'' for you.</li><li>The plates where you get the food is small relative to the bowl you end up with, but you can take 2 bowls but I find that one is enough for me, I do n't eat too much.</li><li>Also the food is not too badly charcoal as she mentioned.</li><li>There is also a small section in the restaurant with traditional buffet food.</li><li>If stir fry is n't your thing, they have the prepared food bar with standard Chinese fare.</li><li>DIY stir fry, dim sum, buffet food, cold bar, and dessert with a chocolate fondue!</li><li>I like the fresh factor of the type of food thats there.</li><li>The already made up food is just okay.</li><li>This used to be my favourite location for the chains of congee restaurants, but it seems the food quality has gone from great to just very good.</li><li>Huge portions, tasty food!</li><li>The food is super tasty and comes out so fast you wonder how many hands are back in their small kitchen!</li><li>I explained to the waitress that all the food was because I 'm a lazy guy who chooses not to cook, to which she replied maybe I should come to your place and cook for you.</li><li>The food is authentic enough for the Chinese, and simple enough for Westerners.</li><li>Much of the food here will dehydrate you and leave you feeling like a prune, so be sure to drink plenty of tea.</li><li>You can ask for your food to be altered in a few ways such as; no peanut oil, not as spicy, no MSG and etc.</li><li>Prices are right and the food is homey and comforting.</li><li>But this place has their service and food done more efficiently.</li><li>I have pics to prove this:) Regardless of its idiotic wait staff, I still heart the food.</li><li>The food here is simply amazing and at such great value !!</li><li>Delivery only after 4 pm. good food, good prices, and there 's free parking! ca n't go wrong, 4 people can eat for $ 40-50 and you 'll need a doggie bag- woof!</li><li>Think four words- bugs in your food.</li><li>I think this is he best restaurant ( food, taste) in comparison !!</li><li>I 've been here over 10 times in 10 years, and this is because they make good Chinese food for good value!</li><li>Food is alway great!</li><li>Generous portions, tasty dishes, very reasonable prices for the amount and quality of food being served.</li><li>Food is consistent and decent portion size.</li><li>We also love to order party trays for pick up and food is prepared so fast!</li><li>Price is cheap and most of their food is pretty good.</li><li>It gets pretty busy even late at night, but the food comes pretty fast.</li><li>The food is good, Particular favorites include the mixed bean and fungi grain fungi for myself, while my gf prefers the fried turnip cake.</li><li>MSG: I do n't go to CW that often but from what I recall last night as I was unable to sleep after a late night meal, I 've come to the conclusion ( because I 'm like Sherlock and I put 2 and 2 together) that Congee Wong puts too much MSG in their food!</li><li>The food here is comparable to Congee Queen, tastes good enough to eat!</li><li>Great chinese food.</li><li>Great to go with friends/family and share the food together.</li><li>Out of all the Congee Wong 's, this is the best because of the quality of their food and service.</li><li>My impression of Congee Wong 's food is always ' The BEST' of all the congee restaurant.</li><li>Regardless, I can say that their food is pretty good, and lots in portion too! it has been consistent over the years as well.</li><li>The food came quick, food was pretty good.</li><li>The food came quick, food was pretty good.</li><li>In our eyes food is more important and man was it good.</li><li>The other dishes were good. we over-ordered as usual but enjoyed the food!</li><li>This is my favourite place for authentic Chinese food that 's family style ( sharing food).</li><li>The food is delicious but the service is n't the greatest.</li><li>The food is fantastic and authentic.</li><li>Classic cantonese style food.</li><li>If my parents drive 30 minutes from home to eat at Congee Wong @ North York, this really is how good the food is.</li><li>The servers are fast and efficient, though not the most friendly .... but, given the food quality and the pricing, it is well worth it.</li><li>It opens late, they give big portions for the money you pay, and the food is delicious.</li><li>What I like about Congee Wong 's food is that it is n't greasy, they give you a good amount of food, &amp; have reasonable prices.</li><li>What I like about Congee Wong 's food is that it is n't greasy, they give you a good amount of food, &amp; have reasonable prices.</li><li>The food in Toronto is just so much better than in the Bay.</li><li>Today we ended up with a $ 35 food trip, tips and taxes in and still lotsa take-out left.</li><li>Such good food and everything comes super fast! 4 people can have breakfast for $ 20.</li><li>The food was fresh but more importantly the congee was made perfectly.</li><li>Like any HK style restaurant, the food came quickly and it got busy fast.</li><li>Service is fast and friendly, the décor is contemporary, inviting and clean and the food here is very fresh and flavorful and the portions are generous.</li><li>Their food, portions, price and location is bang on!</li><li>I was a bit unimpressed walking in because it isnt as glamorous as a Congee Queen for example, but that does n't make the food any less good.</li><li>Their food is good, but their congee and fried noodles are my favourite.</li><li>I 'm not sure if they 've changed around the cooking staff but the food has gotten better!</li><li>Great food, good service and a clean open style restaurant.</li><li>The food was prompt and delicious.</li><li>The food is fine.</li><li>Fast and friendly service, delicious food.</li><li>Congee Wong has good food.</li><li>Food is cheap but delicious.</li><li>Good place for good food and reasonably priced.</li><li>Nothing fancy, just simple food done quick and well, in quantities that will feed a family or a really hungry single person.</li><li>You ca n't get better food for such a good price!</li><li>This is my favourite place when it comes to fast food chinese restaurants.</li><li>Bring a group of people, and I think you will have a great time enjoying the food.</li><li>The food taste just okay.</li><li>My bf, however, seem to love the food here ( particularly the Tofu and Garoupa which he gets every single time =. =)</li><li>However, I do appreciate that their food is not too oily or salty!- other pros: LARGE portions, large variety of congee and noodles, friendly staff- con: can become very crowded: ( side dishes I 've tried and liked: tofu and garoupa, house special chicken, mushroom and beef, tofu and mixed veggie congees I 've tried and liked: mixed vegetable and sweetcorn, sweetcorn and beancurd. congees I 've tried and disliked: sliced fish congee tastes bland ....</li><li>Do n't expect high level of service but the food is banged out at a super fast pace.</li><li>Food is great.</li><li>Service was good but was n't impressed by the food.</li><li>All the food we ordered from their specials menu was great, the regular fried noodles and rice.</li><li>We spent $ 95 and only half the food was edible.</li><li>The food tastes horrible now.</li><li>Good food.</li><li>A huge line up .... ( Well worth it), Cheap prices, and good food.</li><li>The food is acceptable, but I would not praise as it as anything special.</li><li>For example, one particular night, there was a live worm in my food- probably crawled out of the veggies in the kitchen on to my plate.</li><li>That being said, the food was still just fantastic and I know that usually, the service is better.</li><li>I love the food here and as others have written, you have to try the Fried Chili Turnip cakes.</li><li>What are they adding to my food ?!</li><li>Their House Seafood is to die for and their food is always fresh and the best quality.</li><li>The food was not amazing, but with dessert in mind, I might have ate too fast.</li><li>The food, on the other hand, is neither here nor there.</li><li>The cooking style is supposed to be French, but enough French-ness is missing let 's just say it 's nondescript and rather bland food.</li><li>The presentation of the food was excellent. it feels really high end.</li><li>The quality of the food was also excellent.</li><li>The food was average, but the three course meal ( soup, entree and dessert) for like $ 15 is like a super deal, while everywhere else around the city is like price gouging over the same holiday.</li><li>The food was just unpleasant that night and thank goodness their meringue made the experience slightly less unpleasant.</li><li>The food was okay up until the dessert, which is what they are supposedly famous for.</li><li>You might as well go to a decent Western place for this price instead of this Asian-style western food.</li><li>I come here today once again and as usual I ordered my food.</li><li>The service is friendly and the food is very decent.</li><li>The food is average and service is average.</li><li>The dining and food is about average and nothing too special in my opinion.</li><li>Your food and drink prices are too expensive for what you are serving, and if you continue on with the lack of service, pretty soon, your competition will over take you.</li><li>I really get a sense that a lot of effort and care is put into the food.</li><li>Set menu is reasonably priced with consistent quality of food.</li><li>The quality of food was decent, I had a pasta dish that was pretty decent ( it was basil and had something else) It 's a weird set up though, a bakery/restaurant sectioned off by large salt water tanks ... that 's just weird and the decor could use a bit of an update.</li><li>The food is fair for what you pay for.</li><li>In terms of their food, they are very well known for their fried chicken wings.</li><li>Although the restaurant is n't as aesthically pleasing, the food speaks wonders.</li><li>If you 're looking for cheap, fast, and tasty food- this is a must go!</li><li>Their food is very flavourful, and I love coming back here.</li><li>Prices have n't changed and food is the best bang for buck you can find anywhere.</li><li>My co-workers and I decided to try out a place near our work since we are getting sick of the cafe food downstairs and across the way ( expensive/bad).</li><li>It only lacked some veggies but I can only imagine this is what street food is like in Hong Kong.</li><li>All in all, for cheap and quick food with good portions and decent flavours, this place is certainly worth a try if you 're in the neighbourhood.</li><li>Lovely staff who are passionate and the food is just right -- comforting and filling.</li><li>Also, bring cash and you pay at the cashier. soooooo, did you hear about what happened to the goldsteins ? how about the shmaltzbergs son michael, i heard he got an earring! no ? really. what a hoodlum. oy a broch. this might make virtually no sense to you at all or it might make all too much sense to you and either way when you are eating in the cramped space that is bagel plus youll hear this conversation in any number of incarnations at much louder decibel levels than in this review. right at the lip of one of torontos jewish areas ( spanning from as far south as eglinton you might say to as far north as sheppard all along bathurst as its spine) sits this boisterous place thats half bakery and takeaway and half sit down. there are classic chopped eggs, tuna, lox, cream cheese, and herring. then they have a bit of middle eastern flair with falafel plates. the falafel are huge and crispy. they also, make a great spinach salad with a huge ice cream scoop of chopped egg- im sure you can get a huge scoop of just about anything on it. and just about anything you get, will come with, as you would expect, a nice big bagel. i always enjoy my food whenever i go- the menu has long been set and they do it well, but i could do with a little less all the bar mitzvah talk. but when in poland ...</li><li>Overall I liked the atmosphere and the food was ok.</li><li>The food was good- though I 've had better.</li><li>We wo n't be going back for substandard food and extremely poor service.</li><li>I 'd rather take my hard earned money elsewhere for more attentive service and better quality food.</li><li>I have returned since and the food is consistently fantastic, but I do find it a bit of a stretch financially without the prix fixe option.</li><li>Il Fornaro serves OK food at a great price point but I do n't know if I would come back because the services here just not what I expected ....</li><li>Ordered delivery and the food was very bland.</li><li>Food was outstanding and a good time was had by all.</li><li>Food was good, specifically the pizza which was made in a wood burning oven, really delicious.</li><li>Worst service ever and the food was mediocre.</li><li>When the food finally came the pasta was cold and the osso bucco was way too salty.</li><li>The food here is amazing -- I love Indian food, and this is some of the best I 've had.</li><li>The food came relatively fast, and the buttered chicken was served on a sizzling plate with onions that surprisingly was n't burnt.</li><li>So with the food not being very exciting, I turned my attention back to the four girls.</li><li>Otherwise, for a buffet the food was pretty good.</li><li>I go with work colleagues for lunch occasionally and everyone is generally pretty happy with the food.</li><li>The other good part was the way food was packed.</li><li>I mean I do n't expect everyone in the world to know about celiac disease/gluten allergies but I do expect People running a business in the food industry to bloody well be aware of all food related allergies.</li><li>Next, lets discuss the food: The pulao was good and so was the Chana Masada.</li><li>Just do n't eat their food.</li><li>I ordered the butter chicken and there was a fly in my food.</li><li>On top of everything the food is n't even that great.</li><li>The food- naan is large.</li><li>I tried a variety of the dishes because their were a few of us at the table, and normally i would name what I ate and give a little description but it just seemed all the food was uninspired, dry and some seemed crispy like it was under a heat lamp for an extended period of time.</li><li>The food is always consistently yummy.</li><li>Food is amazing.</li><li>We got something similar to a tortilla chip with some veggies in a spicy sauce to dip. ( Not sure what it is called but it was good) I plan on going again to try their lunch buffet! we ordered dinner for two when we stopped by. had bad experience with other buffet style indian food in the past- everything seems a lot more watered down. some of the stuff was good in the pre-fixe menu, some are kinda weird. i liked the tandori chicken and the lamb stew thing. grilled shrimp was mediocre. the long log of some sort of meat was not very good. naan was fresh and crispy so that was a plus. had some leftovers to take home for the next day even. food is alright, not fantastic.</li><li>I believe they gave me left overs and when i questionned them about the quality of food, they did n't seem to care.</li><li>Food is OK only because there is selection.</li><li>I did n't have the misfortune of sitting down for the meal -- I had ordered food for pickup -- but while I was there, I was staring at a few cookers with soup left inside, and the inside of the cookers looked like one of those things left on the floor of tiny restaurants in Chinatown.</li><li>This area is teeming with great food and lovely, well curated restaurants, so I have no idea how a place like Agra can survive.</li><li>The Food: = = = = = = = = The food is great for the price that you pay, lots of selection, do n't forget to try the soup in the corner on a bed of rice that is sitting in a croc pot.</li><li>The Food: = = = = = = = = The food is great for the price that you pay, lots of selection, do n't forget to try the soup in the corner on a bed of rice that is sitting in a croc pot.</li><li>The restaurant is small and the decor is not the best, but the food is always good and tasty.</li><li>They 're extremely courteous, and I appreciate that part, but I think they really could improve in terms of their food quality and they definitely need to make some changes.</li><li>I ate at Agra with a couple of friends a little while back and although the food was tasty what did me in was a creepy, crawly cockroach that ran across the table when we were about to get up to get dessert.</li><li>I would never go back again which is really too bad because the food was tasty.</li><li>The food can be spicy as you like and the food is very special. they do deliveries, and it 's always peacefull.</li><li>The food can be spicy as you like and the food is very special. they do deliveries, and it 's always peacefull.</li><li>The food was delivered at a great temperature.</li><li>It does n't look like much from the outside and its simple décor inside is n't much to write home about ... but the food is amazing!</li><li>We all had a mixtures of dishes, butter chicken, vindaloo, tikka masala, naan breads and they even did a special of bombay potatoes ( it was n't on the menu!) the food was just divine!</li><li>Great food for the price.</li><li>One other thing I did n't like was how our server did not ask how the food was but whether we 'd like to order more food, which felt like she was pushing us to order more.</li><li>One other thing I did n't like was how our server did not ask how the food was but whether we 'd like to order more food, which felt

itself was sublime.</li><li>They do have a good option of food for both vegetarians and meat eaters.</li><li>You 're classic russian jewish joint- food is quite good.</li><li>Good food and reasonable price, very friendly staff and caring owners.</li><li>The food is amazing, right from the salad, to the pickled goods, to your main dish.</li><li>You 'll never get this quality of food at such a great price.</li><li>Coming here with friends is a lot of fun, it 's a cozy atmosphere and the food is homemade.</li><li>I love their food my favourite is their lamb It 's tender, cooked to perfection, and so good you ca n't stop eating it.</li><li>The food is great, but they have the worst customer service of any restaurant I have ever been to.</li><li>My advice, take the food to go.</li><li>Enough food to get you somewhat full and you have n't even placed an order.</li><li>Service was quick, staff was friendly and food was delicious.</li><li>We will make the drive out here again for the atmosphere and delicious food.</li><li>The food is what you expect in a older family style restaurant.</li><li>The food is pretty good ... but not amazing.</li><li>If you 're looking for a family-owned restaurant that has delicious food, check this place out!</li><li>Overall, the food was average, nothing special.</li><li>The food is delicious.</li><li>The food was yummy, fresh and plentiful.</li><li>While my food was great and I thought the seats were extremely comfortable ( we were in a booth), my husband found the booth uncomfortable and the food just pretty good.</li><li>While my food was great and I thought the seats were extremely comfortable ( we were in a booth), my husband found the booth uncomfortable and the food just pretty good.</li><li>However, we both felt that the food was served quickly and felt as if they had known us forever, even though it was probably our first time there.</li><li>It just seemed like EVERYONE knew this food was worth the wait !!!</li><li>Just had a wonderful brunch here and the food was great !!!</li><li>Amazing food, outstanding &amp; quick service, warm atmosphere, great management, and everyone I 've brought here has been pleased by how great of a restaurant this is overall.</li><li>It 's not just about food.</li><li>My husband and I barely touched our food.</li><li>We received our food within reasonable time and I must say the Eggs benedict was great!</li><li>There was a bit of a wait before being seated, but after that we were served promptly with very little wait time to receive our food.</li><li>Everything about this place met all my expectations: great service, wonderful ambience, and delicious food.</li><li>The food is superb &amp; the waitresses are some of the friendliest we 've ever had.</li><li>Coffee was terrible but the food was amazing.</li><li>The food was very good with large portions.</li><li>Great food, great prices and great service!</li><li>The food is always fresh and prepared just right.</li><li>Highly recommended! my go to breakfast place. great atmosphere, awesome food and great friendly service ... if you like all day breakfast 's, go to the valley, you wo n't be dissappointed!</li><li>Fantastic food!</li><li>The food is not any better than anywhere else nor are the prices.</li><li>Very consistent with service and food.</li><li>The portions are generous for the price and the food is always awesome.</li><li>Good food but very pricey, All around the city chicken souvlaki dinner would cost you $ 10- $ 12, here it 's about $ 17, I work near by it 's not somewhere I would eat lunch at everyday, a once in a while treat ..:) Nonetheless the food is good price ridiculous.</li><li>Good food but very pricey, All around the city chicken souvlaki

food is just as great though.</li><li>Thankfully the food was worth the wait.</li><li>Good prices and tasty food; solid neighborhood place.</li><li>Food was good quality!</li><li>They seemed to be short staffed ( there was one waitress serving 5 different tables) and the atmosphere was n't as comfortable as I would 've liked but I enjoyed the food nonetheless.</li><li>Our waiter had to take orders, bring the food to our table, do the cashier work and help with the cooking as well.</li><li>Pros: As authentic as you can get for Japanese ramen Miles ahead of other ramen places Portions are very good TAKOYAKI Cons: Wait times for food can be long Parking is not so friendly out front, use the back when u can Like I said, Kenzo is pretty much as close as it gets to authentic ramen in Toronto.</li><li>This is a favorite new ramen places, thought I wish they had vegetarian options. food okay, service horrible. waited over half an hour to get food at 2:00 in the afternoon.</li><li>The food was great.</li><li>The food here is excellent.</li><li>Great prices and they 're pretty generous with the amount of food.</li><li>Excellent food and good value for portion size.</li><li>Now the food.</li><li>The toppings are typical toppings that you would n't see at a Subway or Mr. Sub, however, their food still has a homemade feel and does n't taste `` commercial''.</li><li>Great food.</li><li>Fresh food, friendly old-school greek counter staff always up for a Leafs or Jays chat, and open past 2:30 a.m. Mon-Sat.</li><li>You 're trashed and need
