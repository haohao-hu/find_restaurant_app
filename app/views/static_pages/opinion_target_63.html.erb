entrée arrived, and exactly like the other burger entrée, the bacon was overcooked and the cheese was hard, as if it had been sitting for a while.</li><li>It comes with eggs, toast, sausage, bacon, and potatoe wedges all for $ 5.50 plus tax.</li><li>The pancakes were okay, the bacon was good ( you ca n't really go wrong with bacon), The potato puffs were tasty ( McCain frozen product) the scrambled eggs were tasteless, and everything else was bad.</li><li>The pancakes were okay, the bacon was good ( you ca n't really go wrong with bacon), The potato puffs were tasty ( McCain frozen product) the scrambled eggs were tasteless, and everything else was bad.</li><li>Some things that you must try if you go: Flounder ( made much better than most AYCE places) Shrimp wrapped with bacon.</li><li>Place was somewhat empty and the food came out a tad slow and they forgot the bacon and croutons in my Caesar salad so they brought it out on the side for me and i had to personally mix them in myself.</li><li>The bacon crumbled when I poked it ( McDonalds has better bacon, seriously guys ...) and the cheese was falling all over the place and not not particularly good.</li><li>We both ordered the eggs benni and a side of bacon.</li><li>The bill came to 40 $ which I thought was high price for cold bacon, undersized juice and half mashed potatoes ...</li><li>Those who are offended by the lack of bacon should move on to another review.</li><li>The service was poor, the potatoes were under cooked, the bacon was all fat.</li><li>Strawberry Waffles are usually a hit ( PRO-TIP: with Nutella swapped for the custard) as well as the Gargantuan Feast which is just that: 2 eggs, bacon, ham, sausage, Canadian peameal bacon, blueberry pancake and roasted potatoes.</li><li>I ordered the Cora Special ( $ 10.95) which consists of 2 eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, house potatoes, toast, fresh fruit and a crepe.</li><li>The bf had Coffee with the gargantuan feast ( 3 sausages, 3 bacon and 3 eggs).</li><li>~ 20 minutes from ordering, my friend 's order of bacon &amp; eggs came; which in reality should take only a few minutes to cook on their [ hopefully ] professional kitchen grade grill top.</li><li>It came with 4 eggs, 2 strips of bacon, 2 sausage links, 2 pieces of ham, 2 slices of whole wheat toast, home fries and 2 pancakes.</li><li>I also ordered their California burger with guacamole, bacon, sundried tomatoes, mayo and pepper jack cheese.</li><li>What I loved:- extra cheese included many choices such as goat cheese, cheddar and Monterey Jack- extra bacon included 2-3 slices- guacamole was free- lots of great fixings to order from, veggies were also fresh ...- so much free sauce and spices ...</li><li>The pepperoni and bacon are by far the best toppings you can get on pizza and they do n't skimp on the toppings here.</li><li>Called had a pleasant conversation and ordered a large pizza with pepperoni, bacon, Italian sausage and extra cheese, and a veal parmesan with hot peppers and mushrooms on a bun.</li><li>I coulda done without the bacon.</li><li>I had the burger, no extra toppings ( cheese, bacon $ 1.29 each).</li><li>Both have their unique differences as the chicken carbonara comes with grilled chicken and bacon while the chicken penne comes with fried chicken and mushrooms.</li><li>Chicken breast, bacon, green onion and parmesan cheese served on spaghetti and tossed in a cream sauce.</li><li>The burger came with guacamole, bacon, onions, tomatoes, lettuce, a lot of cheese and a pickle .... the side was half onion rings half fries ( first time I ever see this kind of side at a pub ?).</li><li>My burger had all of the major food groups: spice, cheese, veggies, bacon, and beef.</li><li>The bacon was crispy and burger was tasty.</li><li>I so wished bacon/pork was kosher cause breakfast without bacon is not the same.</li><li>You wo n't find any bacon or sausage on the menu here, being it 's Kosher.</li><li>I wake up on Saturday mornings and crave the Bacon Veggie Melt It 's a Benedict style dish with green peppers, onions, mushrooms, spinach, and bacon atop a perfect poached egg and an english muffin covered in hollandaise &amp; cheese.</li><li>When he complained the girls did n't do much about it, just brought him some bacon.</li><li>I ordered mine with a small glass of fresh-pressed orange juice plus an extra side of hollandaise ( y' know, as a shooter, the way normal people do- heh heh) and the asked for regular bacon and a coffee.</li><li>If you substitute the bacon for spinach, smoked

turkey bacon.</li><li>When the food came out, there was regular bacon!</li><li>Perfectly cooked over medium eggs, delicious rye toast ( two kinds too- light and dark: D), and choice of meat- for me it was bacon day!</li><li>I mentioned to the waitress that I could not find a combo that came with 3 eggs, bacon, potatoes and pancakes.</li><li>The eggs, home fries, toast and coffee were all about

bacon ... well ... it 's bacon, so not much more to say about it.</li><li>The bacon ... well ... it 's bacon, so not much more to say about it.</li><li>Their French toast and bacon is good.</li><li>Missing bacon, missing hard boiled egg, tasteless dressing, Swiss cheese Instead of blue cheese !!</li><li>Sitting down to eat these yummy looking salads at home when we come to realize the crunchy spinach salad had spoiled bacon on it and it was quite obvious by the foul smell.</li><li>The sandwich felt very wholesome with their unique Calabrese artisan bread, packed with baby spinach, cheese, tomato, pancetta ( Italian bacon, woo!), locally sourced fresh grilled chicken ( !!) and a kick from the salsa verde aioli.</li><li>The Caesar was easily the best I 've had, just enough dressing to wet the leaves but no clumps, just enough cheese and garnish ( bacon) to dress the dish up.</li><li>The chicken was seasoned well and paired well with the carbonerra ( bacon).</li><li>Cames with green salad, potato salad, palm hearts, one egg sunny side up, steak, bacon, provolone cheese, ham, olives, red pepper, tomatoes, mushroom, mayo.</li><li>Now I would never complain about that ratio ... but here 's the kicker ( s): The breaded strips of chicken had a very odd, smoky flavour which after a hesitant second bite, revealed itself to be a strip of bacon wrapped around the chicken ( um, Jewish neighbourhood and no mention of it on the menu), the two chicken wings had a distinctive metallic flavour, the pork ribs were terribly chewy and dry, the shrimp had a mealy, thick dough around them that was n't even fully cooked through and had a terrible, raw-fish smell and taste that lingered in my mouth for an hour afterward and the chicken balls were ok.</li><li>Steamed shrimps had more bacon in it than shrimp.</li><li>Well, it 's sugary waffles sandwiching fried chicken, bacon, and sriracha.</li><li>They take a sizable patty, add the standard

mostly stringy fat.</li><li>The Trucker Special: 2 pancakes, 3 eggs, 2 sausages, 2 pieces of bacon, toast, potatoe hash, baked beans .... it was a pretty awesome brunch meal!</li><li>Fresh homemade chunky homefries, paired with two toasted English muffins, 2 perfectly poached eggs, 2 slices of back bacon ( tastes and looks more like ham), and hollandaise sauce smothered on top.</li><li>I got the All Day Breakfast which came with toast, bacon, eggs, and potatoes.</li><li>Also, this whole fad of putting bacon on Mac and cheese is getting old but good if executed properly.</li><li>The bacon was nice and crisp and it went well with the rye bread I chose.</li><li>The bacon was really tough.</li><li>The price, on first inspection, seemed too good to be true, at 4.99 for the breakfast special ( my order PLUS bacon), but this did n't include coffee, which was 2.50.</li><li>( My friends, who were judging a fancier breakfast- Eggs Florentine- and the quality of the bacon, were firmly in the 4-star camp.).</li><li>Except the bacon which had the test of burnt oil.</li><li>I usually come here for the cheap breakfast sandwiches which will cost you no more than $ 4 and unless you decide to get something fancy with extra cheese and bacon.</li><li>Eggs were ok, but the bacon was barely cooked, the potatoes were super-bland, and the toast was terrible.</li><li>The others in my group

premade items such as bacon.</li><li>The cinnamon brioche with an egg, bacon and a pile of fresh fruit on the side.</li><li>Get quite a bit of cheese curds and bacon on top.</li><li>I love the Angus with bacon.</li><li>I thought that was only bacon ...</li><li>The French toast portion was huge; it came with 3 slices of toast ( all cut in half), with a very generous amount of Oreo toppings, and Chantilly cream ( on the side), two slices of bacon ( or you can choose ham instead), and a nice bowl of fruits.</li><li>Their accuracy is bad I ordered a kids menu for my nephew and here 's what happens he ordered eggs and bacon meal which came with potato, eggs, bread and bacon and a drink and a desert My nephew said over easy they made it overheard there was no bacon on the plate and when my niece ordered a `` freshly squeezed juice'' it was bitter and had chunks or orange peal not even zest !!</li><li>Their accuracy is bad I ordered a kids menu for my nephew and here 's what happens

bacon:).</li><li>So today I went to order the pancake combo and was told that I could n't sub pork bacon for turkey bacon because the kitchen does n't make substitution on the `` signature dishes''

bacon is super crispy, sometimes it 's nearly raw.</li><li>They burnt the bacon, overcooked the eggs.</li><li>Peameal bacon on Eggs Benedict was so chewy it was unpalatable, Turkey bacon looked like pasty white mutant food ... stiff and stale as a board.</li><li>The food is obviously not fresh.- 6 $ for 4 strips of burnt bacon!</li><li>I mainly see this place as a steakhouse, and I order the filet mignon, wrapped in bacon.</li><li>It 's perfectly seasoned, brilliantly juicy and the bacon adds a nice touch to the steak 's flavour.</li><li>The Korean version is dolled up with loads of

desired and were n't worth the calories.</li><li>They put a ton of it, and it 's not like other sub places where it 's already cooked ... here, they take uncooked bacon and microwave it right before they put it on your sub, and it 's great stuff.</li><li>I probably wo n't be back; something 's fishy here that does n't blend with my tastes ... i 'm not sure exactly what it is about this place that 's kept me coming back. i think it 's probably the ... ridiculously amazing subs they make! i 've been coming here for about 10 years now, and i think it 's possible that the submarines have gotten better since. seating is a bit limited, but as long as you do n't go during the rush hours, you should be fine. be prepared to wait 10 mins if it 's after last call and you 've got a craving. their bacon is just the right crispiness, their meats are fresh, fleshly diced lettuce, freshly sliced tomatoes and onions, homemade sub sauce, soft bread. mmmmmm i love that the walls are decorated with photos of loyal customers, some dating back to times when fashion meant a mullet: S they even have a pic with the stanley cup! this local spot has a following for a reason. if you love submarine sandwiches, you have to try one at belly busters. must gets are: anything with bacon `` lettuce, tomatoes, onions guys ?''.</li><li>( Closed Sundays) Love the freshly-microwaved bacon ( LOL) because it is REAL BACON, nice and crisp, not that paper-thin, oddly smoked American fast-food bacon that is popping up everywhere now.</li><li>It is crazy how good the bacon is considering they cook in the microwave ... but the have several to keep up with the demand ... that is how popular bacon is there.</li><li>It is crazy how good the bacon is considering they cook in the microwave ... but the have several to keep up with the demand ... that is how popular bacon is there.</li><li>We 'd pass other lunch options, sure, but none could touch the following equation: Turkey, bacon, extra

Michael S is right- there 's something about hot bacon and mayo.</li><li>Would stick to the bacon subs, the real bacon they use is refreshing to the instant bacon at places like Subway and Mr. Sub.</li><li>Would stick to the bacon subs, the real bacon they use is refreshing to the instant bacon at places like Subway and Mr. Sub.</li><li>You must get a Turkey Bacon sub while here there is
