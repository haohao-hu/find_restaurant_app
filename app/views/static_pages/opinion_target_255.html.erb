<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 255' %><h2>avocado<br />occurrence: 22</h2><div><ol><li>Spider roll ( $ 10.95)- deep fried soft shell crab, avocado, cucumber, flying fish egg &amp; Japanese mayo.</li><li>We had agedashi tofu ( crispy tofu in teriyaki sauce), electric banana ( which was weird at first but actually quite tasty), beautiful roll ( scallop, avocado, smoked salmon), yam tempura.</li><li>The avocado was n't ripe so it was hard and the cooks in the back came across as chop-lazy as almost all the avocado pieces were n't cut through- they were half cut so they were still stuck together.</li><li>And sexy summer rolls are the non-fried ones- they have avocado, lettuce, crab or shrimp, other greenery and come wrapped in a see through rice paper. yummmmzeeerrrzzzzz The staff at the Sheppard and Yonge location are super nice.</li><li>But I will only eat the pho and drink the avocado shake. ( see previous review).</li><li>Nasu Dengaku, grilled eggplant with sweet miso and sesame sauce was beautifully seared over the barbecue and finally the Legend Dragon stood up to it 's name, avocado, cucumber, deep fried shrimp wrapped in spicy salmon with sauce and fish eggs.</li><li>The fish and avocado was very fresh and the service ( albeit slow) was very friendly- even the chef 's greeted me with overwhelming warmth!</li><li>There is little, close to none, avocado.</li><li>The sauce on this roll is excellent and they have avocado in it.</li><li>They really skimped on the avocado.</li><li>On the rolls we ordered, the rice was undercooked and the avocado in the rolls ranged from barely ripened to completely raw and crunchy-chewy.</li><li>Chewy, this happened to be the word that came to mind the most while eating, be it the chewy rice the chewy avocado, the chewy mayo crab or even the chewy eel.</li><li>Ordered the Toronto roll ( crabmeat, spicy salmon, yam tempura, avocado I think) and Unagi Maki roll ( bbq eel).</li><li>Have only been disappointed once, the avocado in the sushi was old and ruined the whole taste, but whatever that was the one time.</li><li>The avocado was super creamy and tasted great with the shrimp tempura in the roll.</li><li>It was rather creepy to see what the standard Japanese restaurant salad dressing looks like in that form, but hard to go wrong with lettuce leaves and sliced cucumber and ripe avocado.</li><li>Otherwise you ca n't really mess up an avocado or yam tempura roll; they were supermarket satisfactory.</li><li>``Spicy-Crispy`` vegetarian ( WITH avocado) maki rolls ... mmmm! their yam tempura is yummy with its extra crispy batter ... they only have ice cream for dessert though .. their sushi might not taste a fresh as say `ten-ichi`s` but like i said, i`m won over by their SPICY CRISPY !!!!!</li><li>Envision spider roll but add avocado and eel on top.</li><li>Hawaiian Roll 5/5- I really like this one too it 's salmon tempura, avocado, cucumber, tobiko topped with spicy tuna &amp; crunch bits Philadelphia Roll 3/5 I 'm not a fan of cream cheese but my friend loved which is smoked salmon, avocado, cream cheese &amp; tobiko.</li><li>Hawaiian Roll 5/5- I really like this one too it 's salmon tempura, avocado, cucumber, tobiko topped with spicy tuna &amp; crunch bits Philadelphia Roll 3/5 I 'm not a fan of cream cheese but my friend loved which is smoked salmon, avocado, cream cheese &amp; tobiko.</li><li>Tiger Roll 4/5- I was reluctant to try a roll with fried scallop, crabmeat, avocado, tobiko, spicy sauce topped with salmon BUT it was pretty tasty and I liked the scallop flavour.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
