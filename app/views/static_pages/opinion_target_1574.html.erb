<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1574' %><h2>dinner specials<br />occurrence: 2</h2><div><ol><li>They also have great dinner specials from what i can see that are reasonably priced!</li><li>Pros: Has lunch specials and dinner specials, food came out quickly, tempura and japchae was yummy Cons: miso soup was too salty, the waitress sat me in a booth and did n't check up on me once the food came, did n't get a water refill, no banchan or kimchi, skimped on the Kalbi for the lunch special If you 're looking for a place in the area that serves Korean food for the same price, your best bet would be the Seoul house on Orfus Rd. You might said I 'm picky but I do n't think I would come back to this place.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
