<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 854' %><h2>wait time<br />occurrence: 4</h2><div><ol><li>However when we did order the deserts. it took about 20 minutes for each desert to arrive separately. which made it basically an hour before we got to the waffle The good thing is we are all sharing the desert as a group. otherwise the wait time was so long that we would literally be waiting for each person to take their turns eating desert. since it arrived almost like a banquet course by course timing.</li><li>The wait time is usually not that bad.</li><li>The wait time was n't so terrible ( 10 minutes) during dinner time on a Friday but they did serve two other guests before us that came after us.</li><li>Overall pretty good but short wait time.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
