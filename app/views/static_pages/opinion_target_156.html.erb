<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 156' %><h2>menu items<br />occurrence: 33</h2><div><ol><li>The Sugar is a weird place with a weird array of menu items.</li><li>Their menu items are varied, and generally pleasing.</li><li>Sometimes too many menu items that cover multiple cuisine types is not a good thing and makes the restaurant look like their not sure of their own identity.</li><li>There 's definitely no shortage of menu items.</li><li>The walls are decorated with posters of drawings of the ingredients of samgyetang, and other menu items.</li><li>There was n't as many crunchy bits at the bottom of the stone bowl, however, probably one of the better bibimbaps I 've had in the GTA so far 3/5 Tip: do n't shy from using that big tub of salt on the table- you will have to season some dishes yourself ( ie: beef bone soup) Looking forward to coming back to try the other menu items.</li><li>However it is important to keep in mind that most menu items are quite mildly flavoured.</li><li>The menu items are priced well.</li><li>Too much of a mish mash of menu items.</li><li>They upgraded their menu items and their new bingsoos are pretty decent.</li><li>Menu items are standard in terms of price, but the food items can be a little expensive.</li><li>Most of the menu items are homemade except for the gyros and the fish filet.</li><li>Their cooked menu items are also well done and you can tell they were thought out, not just added to the menu to follow the `` izakaya'' trend.</li><li>Also many other menu items like meat pies and tattie scones.</li><li>Do n't go if you do n't have a big group as most menu items are meant for sharing.</li><li>Still, I can go downtown for cheaper and almost as many menu items!</li><li>All in all, it was really expensive ( ~ $ 91 for 3 people) for a subpar AYCE sushi place with misleading menu items and okay customer service.</li><li>Recommendations: Scallop sushi and scallop sashimi Beef ribs ( which are cooked to a very pleasing medium-rare) Herb white tuna sashimi Eggplant tempura Avoid: Sushi Legend fried rice Sake mussel ( dry, tough, over-salted) Crazy dragon roll TL; DR Efficient service, great grill items, simple menu items shine over heavily-seasoned and sauced rolls and entrees.</li><li>They do have TVs, but they 're used only for advertisements of their menu items, so I answered `` No'' to `` Has TV'' below.</li><li>On the other you 'll have chinese menu items like chow mein, orange duck, beef stir fry and so on.</li><li>I wo n't bother telling you the menu items as I have tried it all.</li><li>The menu items and the quality of their beef.</li><li>We stay with pretty much the same menu items every year.</li><li>However, I arrived around 830pm one evening and was disappointed that they ran out of a few menu items.</li><li>Very limited menu items, nothing really makes me wanna come back for a second time, probably not my type, but a very busy place.</li><li>All menu items ( burrito, salad, bowls, etc) are under $ 10.</li><li>I 've had a few of their menu items including the famous Pork Bone Soup and everything is reliably good.</li><li>My review is on one of their menu items from the specials board, mi quang.</li><li>Large selection of menu items, all of which are delicious.</li><li>I might go back here to try the other menu items or if I feel the need for some bbq while I am uptown.</li><li>Being new to Korean food, I left it to our dinner companions ( who were clearly well versed in the menu items) to make our selections for the evening.</li><li>But the overall selection of menu items and baked goods puts Bagel Plus in a class of its own.</li><li>Menu is old/battered and dispersed in the restaurant, unlike the other Kenzo establishments ... for example, some of the items are found on the wall ( takoyaki and a few other menu items was not listed on the menu but advertised on a piece of paper on the wall), place is also very old, small and cramped- you 're sitting on wood rather than comfortable chairs.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
