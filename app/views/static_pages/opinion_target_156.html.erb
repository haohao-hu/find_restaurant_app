<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 156' %><h2>ribs<br />occurrence: 41</h2><div><ol><li>The ribs were dry, I think they were sitting out a while, but the meat was tender and like I said, the sauce was quite good.</li><li>The color was kind of off- all sashimi had a warm taste and it was covered in water- it just did n't taste pleasant, we ordered a second round of sashimi .. same thing Rolls- Our roll order was forgotten on the FIRST ticket .. mmm .. we ordered their signature roll .. it was really meh .... and the nori was chewy handroll- the Nori was very soft when it came ... portion of rice to filling .. rice more .. filling a bit .. no good Hot Food- beef roll enoki, and green onions, short ribs, grilled shrimp, grilled cutlet, grilled mushroom, grilled beef, grilled chicken heart, etc etc ( The shrimp did not taste fresh again) but overall the beef were all pretty good! ( or 2nd order some of the grill items were once again forgotten !!!! they were n't even full for the evening !!)</li><li>Lastly, all the cooked meats were over cooked, and as somebody already mentioned the ribs were good.</li><li>( See picture) The fries were not bad, but HAIR on my ribs is a big NONO !!</li><li>The ribs are ok but they 're drenched in sugar-sauce.</li><li>Mondays are ribs &amp; chicken for twenty bucks, but I just ordered just the ribs.</li><li>Their chicken and ribs was A-OK.</li><li>The ribs were tender and fell off the bones easily, but needed more sauce.</li><li>Had the following Calamari- Not too greasy, could be a bit crispier but thoroughly enjoyed it with the Cajun dip Tortilla and Dip- Tasty and refills of tortillas was offered by our server Ribs with Fries n Beans- Ribs were prepared quite good, fall off the bone, not too fatty, not too much muscle fibers, sauce was good, fries were crispy, bans were not mush, definitely recommended NY and Top Sirloin Steak was cooked proper to medium rare, for the price it had a decent depth of flavor, salad that came with it was pretty standard, veggies were cooked well, mashed potatoes was good, first time having the Peppercorn sauce not taste like burnt chocolate, bravo to the new kitchen staff Probably will come back but I 'll probably request Miranda as my server as

...</li><li>The ribs were chewy, tasteless, rubbery and dry.</li><li>The ribs were flavourful and juicy.</li><li>The ribs were ok, a little dry at certain parts but the peanut sauce was great and more than made up for the dryness.</li><li>The ribs were tender and juicy and it also came with a side of edamame beans and corn.</li><li>This is a place to go for those who want it and also want All you can eat. the RIbs were good and a high point, as well as the spicy pork.</li><li>The beef and short ribs were easily the best part of the meal.</li><li>Dishes we tried: Vegetable fried rice, Scallion pancake ( so yummy!), Chicken balls, spare ribs, vermicelli with chicken and more.</li><li>Everything was delicious except the ribs were a tad bit overcooked ( dry).</li><li>Beef or back ribs are a great pick if you 're really hungry.</li><li>We had a nice dinner with the kids The ribs are great and worth the price Side orders are a bit pricy for the size they are serving Overall good food with friendly stuff Worth the price.</li><li>The wings were not saucy but dry and the ribs were normal, nothing special.</li><li>The ribs were amazing. ehhh not bad- 2.5. but not really good, and some of their prices are too high for what you actually get. ex. some of those $ 30 hot pots ... there 's really nothing much in there and no real special soup taste.</li><li>They have n't messed one thing up ... well I only usually get tempura, short ribs, salmon/tuna sashimi, spicy salmon maki rolls but that 's basically the greatest parts of sushi.</li><li>The ribs there is X10000000 better.</li><li>The ribs were terrible, inedible and very hard and chewy, and they were listed as being the best .... far from it, I spit the one I had in a napkin and did n't touch the rest.</li><li>The service was slow and when they asked how the food was, I told them the ribs were not easy to eat and too hard, they told me it 's because of the cut .... did n't offer to comp since I only touched one, or apologize either.</li><li>The ribs were good.</li><li>The ribs tastes like any other place.</li><li>Beer makes me happy. this was ok --- SUMMARY --- Plus 's: good place to hang out, decent food, Minus 's: sitting on the patio means breathing all the car exhaust from the cars on Yonge street --- MORE DETAILS --- we choose a platter for two ... it consisted of: very tender chicken ( i picked it up and a piece of meat fell off- SO TENDER) first time i had cornbread- it looked burnt on the bottom, so i just ate the top part not bad ( it would n't ' be my first choice) pulled pork was ok chicken wings were fairly good beef brisket was pretty good .. ribs were kinda dry ... in the end everything kinda tasted the same. fries were good- not too salty. stepping in, the restaurant itself is nice, there are booths or table seating indoors. the main window is a garage front that opens into the patio area facing yonge st. interior has exposed beam ceilings and there 's many nostalgic memorabilia decorated throughout. we ordered a couple of things from the menu 1. spaghetti with beef brisket- yeah i know an experimental dish but i was feeling like spaghetti and if the brisket was good -- you know that would been amazing. unfortunately the brisket was covered in tomato sauce so I could n't taste it in it 's full glory or not ..</li><li>The ribs were OK, they were actually smoked ..</li><li>And a tiny ramekin of sauce that was not enough for the ribs.</li><li>The ribs were very nice.</li><li>Most of our party had the ribs, which came with a `` Mexican'' sauce, which you can ask for on the side.</li><li>The ribs are really good, they 're not your typical fall-off-the-bone style, which I actually preferred.</li><li>I ordered the steak and ribs combo with the steak blue ... you can tell a lot about the quality of a place by eating their steak almost-raw ... the steak was 5 stars worthy and the ribs were 3 ...</li><li>Steaks are great, Ribs are great, and cake is great!</li><li>Hands down the BEST RIBS in Toronto.</li><li>The decor is a little on the old side but since the ribs were so good I DEF AM COMING BACK !!</li><li>The cut of the short ribs were good quality, but it was not marinated so it had no taste.</li><li>The ribs were actually very good., The mini bbq buns were good as well, but that 's where it ended.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
