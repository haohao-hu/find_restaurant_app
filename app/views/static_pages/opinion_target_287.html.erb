<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 287' %><h2>gyoza<br />occurrence: 19</h2><div><ol><li>Tempura Combo ( $ 10.95)- Miso Soup/Salad and Shrimp Tempura, 5 pcs Sushi and 6 pcs Chef 's Choice Roll- My Shrimp and Veggie Tempura arrived in a bento box with salad, rice, gyoza and some fried items on the side.</li><li>For appetizers we ordered the calamari, gyoza, kaki fry ( highly recommend this one, you really taste the oyster and it 's not overpowered by the coating), spicy salmon sushi pizza, seaweed salad and uni sashimi.</li><li>The lunch boxes came with: salad ( dressing was really flavourful. captured fruity and Asian flavours), mashed potatoes with teriyaki sauce, corn, and spicy mayo, a gyoza, rice.</li><li>We tried a wide selection of appetizers including the fried tofu with something on top ( I forget what that is called ...), kalbi ribs, gyoza, yakitori.</li><li>Everything was great, I really enjoy their gyoza.</li><li>Tempura was light and the Gyoza were nice and crisp.</li><li>The salad was nice albeit a little difficult to eat because the cabbage was sliced so long and the Gyoza was really tasty.</li><li>The gyoza is A-OK, but not worth the price.</li><li>They have authentic okonomiyaki that they make fresh and serve on a sizzling platter with all the fixings. their gyoza is fresh and cooked to perfection. their takoyaki ( round pancake balls with a piece of octopus) is authentic and fresh too. less soup base options to ajisen, but if you find the equivalent here, you should find that it is less salty, less msg. being korean run, seeing any kimchi or pickled radish actually makes sense, and i think there is kalbi ( korean beef short ribs) on the menu as well. their service is not fast, and this place can be quite busy at times, but if you want ramen and you are not downtown on dundas or queen street, this is the best ramen you can get. i can vouch for the quality and consistency of this particular location, dunno about other Kenzo locations. i miss the tempura they used to have at this location, but it was taken off the menu. if you want an authentic bowl of ramen or okonomiyaki that is the closest thing to getting to Japan and having one there, this is the place if you are uptown.</li><li>We also ordered the miso ramen as well as the gyoza.</li><li>The gyoza was ... alright.</li><li>I had also ordered the gyoza and tonkatsu.</li><li>The gyoza was good, but you ca n't really go wrong with that.</li><li>This place specializes in Ramen, I usually prefer their Sho-yu and Miso ramen combo with their gyoza.</li><li>Delicious Ramen and gyoza is the best I have tasted in the city.</li><li>Delicious Gyoza, Tacomaki that melt in your mouth, and the ramen ... complex, flavorful, delicious.</li><li>We ordered Sapporo Miso Ramen, tonkatsu lunch and gyoza.</li><li>We tried the king 's ramen, shio ramen, and gyoza- pleased with every aspect of our meals.</li><li>The tonkotsu and Sapporo miso we ordered were both unremarkable, and the gyoza was just not worth the money.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
