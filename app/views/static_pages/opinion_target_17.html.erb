love the atmosphere indoors, as well.</li><li>Great place for corporate events in their lounge area and if there are no private parties there, make sure to grab a seat by the fireplace and cozy up

and service was great.</li><li>Food was good, atmosphere was nice, although a little loud due to the large parties around us.</li><li>Very good service, great food and nice atmosphere.</li><li>By being out of the way, diners are able to circumvent the rushed atmosphere that spoils so many of the more well-known restaurants in town.</li><li>I am thrilled to expose them to such a fine

little slow.</li><li>The service was excellent and the atmosphere was pretty good.</li><li>The atmosphere was nice and cozy with an area with a lot of natural light near the front, but the rest was quite dark with some string lights everywhere.</li><li>Finally, the atmosphere itself.</li><li>Atmosphere is very very casual, service was friendly.</li><li>Good food, service, atmosphere, and reasonably priced given it 's a steak house.</li><li>Very mature atmosphere which is always nice.</li><li>I enjoyed a nice glass of wine and it was such a peaceful and calm atmosphere for a family dinner.</li><li>Lighting is quite dark to make for a more intimate atmosphere, and thankfully it 's not too loud inside.</li><li>The atmosphere is still the same with the red vinyl benches.</li><li>Parking lot for customers This place does have seating however it is small and the atmosphere is more of a take out place.</li><li>It is not dirty, just does not have a comfortable atmosphere.</li><li>The atmosphere here was very cool with the largest coke collection I have seen in a long time.</li><li>I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere as well as the food.</li><li>I love their

restaurant!</li><li>My husband and I love sushi and we 've been having trouble finding a place in north york that is reasonably priced, with good atmosphere and delicious food ...</li><li>Fresh fish, genuinely attentive service, and a great atmosphere, all at affordable prices.</li><li>Using everything from clusters of little tea light candle holders to an upturned wicker basket with a candle inside it, the lighting and atmosphere is warm and inviting.</li><li>I love the relaxed atmosphere here with comfy seats and awesome food.</li><li>A bit pricey but it 's well worth it if you 're having a craving for some middle eastern cuisine:) The atmosphere with the wall-waterfalls and Afghan music just brings me back.</li><li>Do n't let the appearance of the restaurant fool you The restaurant has a great atmosphere.</li><li>It 's a small place and entirely family run, so the service is sometimes slow and they will sometimes run out of specials, because I guess they make only so many/night, but that just proves the family-run business atmosphere and the homemade food.</li><li>Service is friendly and the atmosphere is pleasant.</li><li>Although the booths are a tight squeeze for four adults, the atmosphere is really cute and cozy and everything is neat and tidy.</li><li>There is very nostalgic atmosphere here.</li><li>Friendly atmosphere where the owner really care about its costumers.</li><li>Congress is a very local bar with a friendly atmosphere.</li><li>Definitely a ma an pa type atmosphere but almost feels homie and nice if sitting down.</li><li>You 'll find a real cozy family like atmosphere where the people have you actually sitting in their kitchen/dining room with a giant hot table filled with Italian favorites.</li><li>The atmosphere was sparse with

decent.</li><li>Cozy atmosphere, kept clean, with wooden tables.</li><li>Not to mention a great atmosphere and very professional service.</li><li>Linguine Pescatore- very generous with the seafood and

excellent service and amazing take-out to boot.</li><li>Nice atmosphere.</li><li>I found the service, food and atmosphere to be great and while the location is pretty small and cramped, it 's not busy enough to really bother me.</li><li>Although this particular location is a bit small and cramped, the great food and atmosphere make up for the lack of space.</li><li>While St. Louis on York Mills is not my go-to for a romantic dinner and also not a gastro-pub experience ... it 's got friendly staff and a quiet atmosphere on weekdays.</li><li>A sign at the front door about proper sushi eating etiquette is indicative of the calming atmosphere of the dining room.</li><li>I do n't mind it at all but its the complete opposite of say, the Keg, in terms of decor and atmosphere.</li><li>Staff member are friendly and atmosphere is the usual and casual.</li><li>The atmosphere is great for socializing or just doing work if you 're able to work with the small conversations going on around you.</li><li>However, the atmosphere leaves a lot to be desired.</li><li>They recently renovated, and the atmosphere is nice and fairly quiet, good for couples and families.</li><li>The seating inside is plentiful, the atmosphere is nice, and our waiter was just lovely ( he was very friendly and his service stood out), but as I consider food to be the star of the show, I wo n't be hurrying back here any time soon, though I wo n't say I 'd never try it again.</li><li>Tucked into the small street if Willowdale ave, this place has a non pretentious atmosphere, the food is delicious and fair prices.</li><li>Not a welcoming atmosphere our waiter was not helpful at all.</li><li>The atmosphere is fine.</li><li>As for the rest: Atmosphere is nondescript and boring.</li><li>You get a nice family atmosphere restaurant called Chowon.</li><li>Great atmosphere.</li><li>I really like the atmosphere in the restaurant.</li><li>The atmosphere is n't my favorite as I always find myself uncomfortably underdressed and young, but if you 're prepared, you 'll fit right in.</li><li>The piano that plays itself when you enter is a little creepy, but it created a beautiful atmosphere.</li><li>The atmosphere was nice, however, none of us really enjoyed the food there.</li><li>The place does n't have a cool hipster atmosphere like places downtown.</li><li>The food is OK and the atmosphere is OK mostly middle aged individuals.</li><li>The atmosphere and decor are what lifting it to the `` fine'' level.</li><li>Great atmosphere, great service and very good portions.</li><li>This is a good sushi place with a get-down-to-business atmosphere.</li><li>The atmosphere was gloomy, no one smiled and store was crowded and looked a tad messy.</li><li>It is pretty to look at and has a great overall atmosphere but do n't be deceived!</li><li>The atmosphere was a little quiet but nice ( it was a weeknight).</li><li>The atmosphere was quaint and cosy and had very nice decor.</li><li>Friendly staff and welcoming atmosphere.</li><li>It was busy and slightly noisy, but adds to the overall good atmosphere of the restaurant.</li><li>Atmosphere ? beautiful.</li><li>Great atmosphere with beautiful wooden metallic doors to red wooden screens inside.</li><li>Whenever I go, my usuals are: Peking duck Coconut fried rice Curry fish pot Although prices are a tad high, I find their quality and atmosphere worth it.</li><li>The atmosphere is very nice given it the dim light environment and the natural light from the street.</li><li>It has a high ceiling and some pillars that provide a very classy, but modern atmosphere.</li><li>The atmosphere is dark with attempts at creating a Thai atmosphere with a fake idol and carved wooden panels.</li><li>Top stars for service, atmosphere, and most important of all flavour.</li><li>I enjoyed the atmosphere and interior!</li><li>Linda 's is my definition of a GOOD fancy restaurant: Authentic food, moody atmosphere, and attentive service.</li><li>Great atmosphere, but still quite busy midweek.</li><li>Nice atmosphere Overpriced food!</li><li>The atmosphere is very nice, lots of

value nice quick service and very friendly atmosphere.</li><li>Overall it was a very good experience; modern setup, friendly staff, and a lively atmosphere.</li><li>Loved the atmosphere, and it was clean.</li><li>Great food, decent prices, nice atmosphere, super friendly service.</li><li>Very small, quaint and intimate atmosphere with friendly service.</li><li>Yes, it does n't have the best atmosphere.</li><li>But warm atmosphere, super friendly and attentive service, and delicious eats made the experience great.</li><li>I highly recommend, if this kind of food and homey atmosphere is your thing.</li><li>Welcoming, cozy atmosphere.</li><li>Very casual atmosphere.</li><li>Being the only customer, the message given was I 'm not important enough to stop their cleaning and provide a decent atmosphere.</li><li>It can get really busy on weekend mornings though, so anticipate a busy atmosphere at those times.</li><li>The atmosphere is just like any sports bar.</li><li>SERVICE: overall the service was great, atmosphere was friendly and had a rustic vibe.</li><li>For the six of us, with no alcohol, the bill came out to $ 300 before gratuities- quite expensive for the lack of service and atmosphere.</li><li>Amazing service, outstanding food and comfortable atmosphere.</li><li>I love the atmosphere as it takes you to the east coast.</li><li>The atmosphere and decor is similar to `` mom &amp; pop'' seafood places found in the Atlantic so do n't expect anything high-end.</li><li>I only ever got take out though because the atmosphere is pretty grimy but holy hell the food is amazing! 6/5 for the roti, it 's that good.</li><li>The atmosphere is the same- well lit and in open view of everyone else dining in the restaurant.</li><li>The atmosphere is fairly clean and spacious enough.</li><li>Add the clean, comfortable and bright atmosphere and I can see why Congee Queen is so popular.</li><li>The atmosphere is more clean, and the prices are about the same and depending on the item possibly cheaper.</li><li>It 's a little loud and the atmosphere is not as good as the good ol days but ten rens still is a great place to get a damn good bubble tea.</li><li>The atmosphere is more industrial versus coffee cafe cozy.</li><li>Only complaint is my coat was soaked with the frying smell after I got home. got the taro slush and milk custard toast and crispy chicken. both were really delicious, and the service and atmosphere here was nice. it was a little chilly though, not sure if it was just because today was super cold or if it was the tea shop. their menus are also adorable:) it was a great place and id definitely come back The Rolls Royce of bubble teas.</li><li>They have some regular costumers that are rude ( not their fault though, but adds up to the atmosphere).</li><li>Service was friendly and the atmosphere was quite nice.</li><li>My friends who have been down to Joon 's on Bloor St. said that the menu here is smaller, however this was a fun restaurant with friendly staff and a cozy atmosphere.</li><li>The atmosphere is extremely casual and the restaurant itself was quite small and narrow, with a tiny raised portion to the side that could seat two parties of about four each.</li><li>The atmosphere is great if you just want to hang out with your friends and talk for a bit.</li><li>Sushi Bong is a small place mainly for take out, there is no ambiance or atmosphere or fancy wooden boats to serve sushi.</li><li>I gave it a five star because it 's just a really good atmosphere.</li><li>I deducted points for poor atmosphere and crowds.</li><li>I travel for to China mainly for work very often and I can actually say the food and atmosphere here reminds me deeply of the hip, delicious food stalls in China.</li><li>The atmosphere of the restaurant seemed rather lively and upbeat with many popular 90 's hip hop songs to keep your mind elsewhere as you wait for your food.</li><li>I would say this place along with its atmosphere has my kind of comfort food ~ Before leaving, be sure to also order a Pork Jia-Mo bun to have for breakfast next day!</li><li>I like the atmosphere inside.</li><li>I have been here quite a few times now, the food is reasonably good, the service if you dine in can be fairly slow and the atmosphere of the restaurant is n't t as relaxing as it could be due to the decor, like walking into a 70 's movie ..</li><li>The atmosphere can definitely use a face lift, but the duck is worth the wait!</li><li>Food comes out fast and the atmosphere is very nice.</li><li>The atmosphere is awesome too- very cozy, and it is a perfect mix of restaurant and fast food which makes it perfect for lunch, and get together at night.</li><li>That said, the food was fine, the atmosphere was smoky.</li><li>However, I definitely recommend coming here at least once, if not for the food, then for the cheery, relaxed atmosphere.</li><li>The atmosphere is really nice and they have these cute booths on the side.</li><li>2) They serve ~ 10 side dishes Aside from these 2 things, it 's a very standard Korean place with your typical mom and pop atmosphere.</li><li>The restaurant was noisier than Chinatown on a Saturday morning- not exactly a nice atmosphere for a relaxed dinner.</li><li>Great place- exquisite cuisine, peaceful atmosphere.</li><li>Nice atmosphere and minimalistic and clean decor.</li><li>I like the atmosphere mainly because I know the people by first name now.</li><li>Very nice, tranquil music and good atmosphere.</li><li>It 's a bit cramped most of the time though so although there 's a welcoming atmosphere .. it is n't great for one on one conversations Went here for few years.</li><li>Overall this was a fun dessert place with friendly servers and a nice, light atmosphere.</li><li>The dessert is so fantastic ( the shaved green tea ice cream is heaven in your mouth), and the atmosphere is very relaxed.</li><li>Since I did n't order any food, I am grading this solely based on atmosphere and drinks.</li><li>The atmosphere was quiet and calm.</li><li>Nice atmosphere, a very Asian-style cafe with chic modern look.</li><li>Its a small, little place, but nice, cozy, warm, and friendly atmosphere.</li><li>The atmosphere is good for having a rest.</li><li>Immediately was impressed with the quant and clean atmosphere at this dessert house.</li><li>I also love the atmosphere and the fact they offer free wifi is an added bonus.</li><li>Service is great, and the atmosphere is very relaxing.</li><li>In terms of the atmosphere and the interior, the quality is certainly a few notches above your average in-store eatery.</li><li>The fresh and bright atmosphere welcomes you to cheery servers and delicious food:) Pastel has many desserts, including ( if I am not mistaken) Peruvian chocolate mousse.</li><li>The cafe is pretty small, but I like the atmosphere of it.</li><li>Overall comfy atmosphere that I 'd love to return to.</li><li>It was a nice casual comfy atmosphere.</li><li>Healthier, more food for your dollar, and a much quieter, friendlier atmosphere.</li><li>-THE DECOR: cozy and classy, with a sexy atmosphere; dimmed lights, candles, table settings, chair covers, fun sights on the dance floor, and so on ....</li><li>It has a traditional yet modern look creating a pleasant atmosphere.</li><li>Atmosphere is nice.</li><li>- Quiet atmosphere- it can get busy during dinner hours on Friday and Saturday nights or during lunch hour during the week, but with only about 10 tables it 's a nice intimate atmosphere.</li><li>- Quiet atmosphere- it can get busy during dinner hours on Friday and Saturday nights or during lunch hour during the week, but with only about 10 tables it 's a nice intimate atmosphere.</li><li>Service was alright, atmosphere was OK, but what will keep me from coming back here is the sub-par food, the lack of decent portions and the whack prices.</li><li>Was quite impressed with the service, fresh ingredients and cozy atmosphere.</li><li>Not very big inside but that 's one of the things that lends this place it 's cozy atmosphere.</li><li>Overall: Decent atmosphere and service but nothing special about the food.</li><li>Service, taste and atmosphere were excellent. looking forward to next time.</li><li>Nice neighbourhood spot with a cozy atmosphere.</li><li>A true diner feel and homey atmosphere.</li><li>Not impressed with the atmosphere or the decor, a bit dark on the inside, but we were starved and did n't care.</li><li>The atmosphere is great!</li><li>Good service, nice atmosphere ( but very loud).</li><li>The atmosphere is OK.</li><li>The atmosphere in terms of decor and noise level like being at a mcdonalds but with sushi and servers.</li><li>This is ` a `` come for the atmosphere'' restaurant, it ` a `` come for the cheap lunch specials'' typa spot.</li><li>But, the food makes up greatly for it and it 's a friendly atmosphere!</li><li>The atmosphere is n't amazing, but the food and quality of service makes up for it.</li><li>The teppanyaki creates a great atmosphere.</li><li>Things like atmosphere, value, service, and the general buzz of a place can make or break a good time.</li><li>Provides a very friendly and warm atmosphere in addition to a great selection of Italian food and treats.</li><li>That certainly set a little Euro-mood &amp; atmosphere for me which added to the experience I was about to embark on.</li><li>Richtree seemed like a logical choice because it is a casual atmosphere which does not require a reservation.</li><li>The atmosphere is great for a neighborhood that has little else going on in the close vicinity.</li><li>I still like the atmosphere, but I think the quality of the food has declined.</li><li>I have been going to this location for a few years mostly because I enjoy the pseudo-European garden atmosphere, the unique seating and the crepes.</li><li>Tthe crowds here make the place feel stuffy and the atmosphere here just feels stiff.</li><li>I do n't like paying a large premium for the atmosphere unless I `` m trying to impress someone ( which is rare of me).</li><li>Great atmosphere !!</li><li>In summary, I come for the atmosphere of the bar area, to be with friends and to enjoy the game but before that, I will visit one of the fast food restaurants around the area for food.</li><li>Most other times it 's a slightly mundane atmosphere, as most patronage are of the after hour slightly intoxicated night-life bunch, but I did come here a few times for leisure.</li><li>If youre with the guys/gals i would recommend sitting in the bar area where theres a better atmosphere and, I suspect, better service.</li><li>The atmosphere is quite nice as well.</li><li>Overall, pretty good food, but not the greatest; wonderful service and atmosphere.</li><li>This is one of the nicer Chinese restaurants in the area in terms of service and atmosphere.</li><li>Waiters are n't rude and repeatedly come back to ask how you 're doing. atmosphere is great.</li><li>Warm, soft lighting, big comfy chairs, soft cozy booths -- really a great atmosphere for a lounge.</li><li>Ill start off with some pros Pros: The decor and atmosphere is pretty nice.</li><li>The atmosphere was friendly and not too loud.</li><li>Great atmosphere and decent food, works for me.</li><li>Overall, its a good place to go if you are under a budget! so sad! this place is close! i used to come here but recently i realize that it 's been replace by a korean restaurant. the wontons are so filled with shrimp, the fish balls had bones in them i always get scared the bones might choke me but the food tasted awesome! hot water dispenser is at each table so you make your own tea. the soups tasted too much of msg ... delicious but ... msg is bad for you. bye bye wonton place, i kinda miss you. small portions, but i love how u can put your own oyster sauce into your noodles, instead of asking like other regular wonton noodle places. also enjoyed having a hot water faucet at my table. clean and good atmosphere.</li><li>Cora 's has a very bright and welcoming atmosphere and the staff are extremely friendly, creating a sense of belonging to those who visit.</li><li>Overall: For about $ 10 a person, it definitely beats out any kind of food court or fast food options nearby for health, variety and atmosphere.</li><li>I liked the atmosphere and the food looked quite good, decided to do take out.</li><li>Great food and atmosphere.</li><li>I love the atmosphere in the restaurant.</li><li>In addition, the price is reasonable for the portion size and the atmosphere is quite nice.</li><li>Came with my wife and cousin because we know nothing about Persian food and wanted to sample it in a pleasant atmosphere.</li><li>Very cordial and inviting atmosphere and wait staff.</li><li>The atmosphere can be a bit strange though, there seems to be a very large part of the restaurant with big seating areas, I guess for big parties or something, and if you come on a slow night ( I came early on a Friday evening in the middle of January, there were only two other tables at the time) it can look very dark and empty.</li><li>Anyway, nice atmosphere, good food and awesome staff!</li><li>Outdated tables and chairs, very dark and unpleasant atmosphere ... the food is by far the worst persian food Ive had .... no taste at all.</li><li>The atmosphere is nice and clean and they have a great pop dispenser, but the food was awful.</li><li>Very satisfying. satay on the road has been one of my family 's favorite restaurants since i was a kid. i remember coming here when i was ten and ordering the same thing that i get now, ten years later: cashew nut chicken with an order of steamed rice and the shrimp chips with peanut sauce. first of all, the food tastes delicious. i think there 's been one or two times out of the hundreds of visits to this place where the food tasted a little spicier than usual but other than that, it 's been consistently amazing for close to a decade. i 've had cashew nut chicken at other thai restaurants and it just does n't compare. i ca n't speak about most of their other food but from what i 've experienced they 've been by far the best tasting thai restaurant in and around toronto. the wait staff is quick and friendly for the most part which is great. the atmosphere of the restaurant is nice ... they just re-did it and although i have to say i prefer the original decor which had an authentic thai feel to it, their modern, contemporary approach to their new `` look'' is very pleasing to the eyes and enjoyable to dine at as well. the value of the food is great. my girlfriend and i come here for their lunch special almost every week at least once and have a full meal with a drink that leaves us satisfied for both taste and hunger for usually under $ 10, 15% tip included. how can you beat that ? really. not to mention, you can order shrimp chips and peanut sauce as an appetizer while you wait for your meal, at no charge. i have yet to find another thai restaurant in toronto that has that. five stars to my favorite thai place since i was ten. i was happy to see that they expanded and opened another store on bayview. good for them!</li><li>It has a nice an cozy atmosphere, and service can be rather slow, but I do not mind waiting as I know good food made from scratch and with love takes time.</li><li>The atmosphere was busy but quiet to talk comfortably.</li><li>Casual atmosphere.</li><li>If you wanna go somewhere fancy smanshy and expect a more formal atmosphere this is not the place for you.</li><li>Atmosphere was very calm.</li><li>I really liked the atmosphere and Asian theme of the furnishings.</li><li>The atmosphere was nice but the restaurant was pretty dead on the Monday night we were there.</li><li>Their breakfast choices are super yummy- nice atmosphere, really good service.</li><li>The atmosphere and decor are great here along with the service.</li><li>Went there for breakfast today, it was nearly empty because of the timing, but the staff was very friendly and the atmosphere of the place was really calm and perfect for breakfast.</li><li>The atmosphere was good.</li><li>Great atmosphere for afternoon drinks, espcially the patio.</li><li>Nice atmosphere and good breakfast.</li><li>The atmosphere inside is perfect for a date, a meeting, or grabbing drinks with friends.</li><li>All the meat was dry and the best meat was the wings, but that was even fairly average. they do have free refills on drinks and the server was rather attentive and nice. but the food and the atmosphere does n't cut it for me to want to come back.</li><li>The decor and atmosphere is great.</li><li>The staff was very courteous and I like the atmosphere, but the food left something to be desired.</li><li>Very nice atmosphere.</li><li>It 's small so come early or order ahead:) This little gem is definitely worth the drive, I would love to keep it my little secret, but the food, atmosphere, &amp; service is too good to not share!</li><li>The restaurant is small but has a nice atmosphere.</li><li>Always fresh, clean and pleasant atmosphere.</li><li>The service was good, the atmosphere intimate with nice instrumental music playing in the back ground.</li><li>Fresh fish, friendly servers, and awesome atmosphere.</li><li>What I do like about this location is the service and the atmosphere.</li><li>Not

waitress and I know that a smile, albeit terrible food or atmosphere will go a long way in making someone 's day brighter.</li><li>The service of the place seemed average along with the atmosphere.</li><li>I`m giving it 1.5 stars because the service was decent but the food and atmosphere could be improved ( the place looked old and not well kept).</li><li>I ca n't EAT atmosphere and cleaniness though.</li><li>We have attended a couple of times and always enjoyed the food and the atmosphere which made the experience last night all the more disconcerting.</li><li>Atmosphere was nice and quiet, service was decent, waiters were pretty friendly and helpful.</li><li>The warm colored interior and slightly dimed lights created a cozy atmosphere, even though the place was almost packed and somewhat loud.</li><li>What a shame ..... and yes, the place was pretty empty ( Tuesday afternoon) This place needs to go back into its past &amp; rethink everything, what happened to that happy, light hearted atmosphere that was Wimpy 's ? ..... they went 99% of the distance with the decor .... but seriously, why unplug the Jukebox setup; really dumb- ( uh that kinda was the whole idea of having it there ....</li><li>The place is a diner so do n't expect a posh atmosphere.</li><li>Decent food, friendly staff and cool atmosphere.</li><li>But I do recommend people go once to dine in a fine atmosphere ( unless there are other groups of people coming in dressed in garbage clothes- they need to enforce the dress code) I have been here a handful of times and unlike most of the reviews found here, my experience has always been a 4 star minimum.</li><li>The staff were polite and were able to make us feel welcomed to such a matured high end atmosphere.</li><li>The atmosphere was geared more towards business than romance ( maybe that was a clue).</li><li>I have been a regular at the Duncan House for years and have always loved their food, service, and the overall atmosphere.</li><li>I just thought it would come out a bit quicker. all in all, it 's a good restaurant, and definitely a good place to go if you want the fancy atmosphere or if you want to impress a guest.</li><li>Fantastic food and great atmosphere.</li><li>To sum it up, my experience was wonderful and it 's upscale fine dining in a warm and romantic atmosphere.</li><li>Great atmosphere and friendly staff.</li><li>The atmosphere is nice and usually never quiet, since this place always has people out and about, and there is always kpop music playing in the background.</li><li>I like the atmosphere because it 's bright and the tables and decor look modern.</li><li>One thing that is different is the atmosphere.</li><li>Great selection, service was fantastic, wonderful atmosphere.</li><li>Great atmosphere and prompt service.</li><li>However would have preferred to have more selection of desserts ... the place and atmosphere is comforting .... plus you fet to watch the chef cooking in action with those gigantic looking chopsticks haha Definitely a place to come back to ....</li><li>Virtually everyone I knew has good things to say about this place--the authenticity of the `` wok'' taste, the low prices, the homely/cozy atmosphere, the large menu with wide varieties of items, and perhaps most importantly, the fact that it opens well after midnight!</li><li>They have a nice bustling atmosphere, and a nice clean look inside.</li><li>It 's a casual atmosphere with an interior that is kind of dark.</li><li>If the take out side had more atmosphere itd be better.</li><li>The atmosphere is very cozy and reminds me of home; it 's a perfect breakfast or lunch destination for families.</li><li>Overall I liked the atmosphere and the food was ok.</li><li>Went here for Summerlicious lunch- great atmosphere and decor.</li><li>Once I made it in I found that the atmosphere was good and the menu had a good variety to choose

breakfast place. great atmosphere, awesome food and great friendly service ... if you like all day breakfast 's, go to the valley, you wo n't be dissappointed!</li><li>Homey atmosphere, good service, good food, good value for your money.</li><li>They seemed to be short staffed ( there was one waitress serving 5 different tables) and the atmosphere was n't as comfortable as I would 've liked but I enjoyed the food nonetheless.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
