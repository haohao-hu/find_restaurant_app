<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 270' %><h2>garlic sauce<br />occurrence: 21</h2><div><ol><li>Ask them to bring you hot sauce and garlic sauce to your table!</li><li>Shredded pork in garlic sauce had a spice that I could n't place but did n't like ... a lot of dishes seemed to have traces of this spice and it made all the food taste the same.</li><li>Also had eggplant in garlic sauce which was mushier than your typical Chinese restaurant but worked out well.</li><li>I tried his shrimp and found them to be very absolutely divine because the shrimps were perfectly cooked and the garlic sauce was exquisite!</li><li>Toppings include various types of cabbage/salad, tomatoes, onions pickled radishes, garlic sauce and hot sauce.</li><li>The garlic sauce also tasted great and the spicy sauce provides an interesting ' afterburn'.</li><li>My only one unpleasant experience is when a lady served us the shawarma plate and she forgot to top the rice with some onions and garlic sauce, ( place was not busy, only one person dining in and one takeout customer) so I had to walk back from the car in the rain to kindly request for the toppings that add a gazillion notch to this dish, which she gladly did.</li><li>Make sure you get extra garlic sauce and hot sauce when you eat here:).</li><li>But you definitely should go here for the Sh awarma plate because it is so delicious and huge! popped in here during lunch, and of course it 's because I was craving my New York style chicken on the rocks. the portion was huge but it was n't satisfying. the rice was over cooked but the chicken was good- I was looking for that perfect garlic sauce but it was n't enough in the meal.</li><li>The garlic sauce to accompany tasted home made and their hot sauce complimented items well.</li><li>Both items included some pickles and garlic sauce ( which was amazing) The food was hot, fresh, and tasty.</li><li>I also forgot to mention that while serving me the wrong salad that the server dropped garlic sauce into my lap and on my clothes.</li><li>Chicken Shawarma Sandwich- Shredded pieces of chicken grilled on a rotating spit with shredded lettuce, pickles and garlic sauce wrapped in a pita I really loved this, and chicken is usually at the bottom of my meat list.</li><li>It came with some ok hummus and a very potent garlic sauce, which is more crushed garlic then sauce.</li><li>Then we usually get a veggie which always ends up being Chinese Brocoli with garlic sauce which is always hot and crunchy, and always has enough sauce to cover everything.</li><li>In terms of taste, the duck was crispy and decent. it didnt have much flavour on its own, so you have to rely on the sauce provided to give it flavour. after you eat the skin, there are multiple options on how you want to eat the rest of the duck meat, you can serve it with garlic sauce or you can add more $ $ to eat it diced with lettuce or other options available.</li><li>I would not recommend the option with the garlic sauce which is additional $ 2, bcuz it was simply chopping up the duck with some sauce on top, this method was hard to eat bcuz there was barely any meat left on the duck, so you would be spending most of your time nibbling on bones lol but i wasnt very willing to spend an additional $ 7 to have them debone the duck and give me a few pieces of lettuce either lol.</li><li>I also asked for extra garlic sauce and they gave me a very small container of it.</li><li>They drizzle the whole thing with a fantastic garlic sauce ... extra please!</li><li>As you work your way through the chicken and salad, the rice ends up being coated in a mixer spicy BBQ sauce, garlic sauce and which ever salad dressing you chose ( ranch for me!) leaving a sloppy mess of yumminess at the end.</li><li>We ALWAYS get the walk-in special which is one large pizza with extra tomato sauce with 2 toppings for $ 9.99 and a garlic sauce on the side for a buck extra.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
