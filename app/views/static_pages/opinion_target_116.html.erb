<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 116' %><h2>roll<br />occurrence: 48</h2><div><ol><li>Oh, try the love roll, bulgogi, spicy chicken, spicy salmon roll and sushi pizza! you 're welcome.</li><li>Dragon roll ( shrimp tempura, mayo and cucumber) is $ 9.50- okay kind of expensive but not too bad- but hey about a small slice of salmon on top of the rolls ( as in the pictures) ? $ 15.50 !!?!?!?</li><li>The menu was ridiculously expensive- $ 15.50 for the roll we ordered ( sorry, forgot the name, but it sucked!)- we had to pay $ 1 extra for spicy mayo, which they gave quite a bit in a small dish.</li><li>Instead they gave literally less than a dab of that same spicy mayo from the roll I had before on each of the maki.</li><li>I was n't too hungry so I just got a futomaki roll, but even for this simple roll it was one of the best I 've had.</li><li>I also had a beautiful roll, which had spicy salmon roll ( premade many many hours ago) as a base so that was automatically bad.</li><li>We also ordered three rolls, Spicy Killer ( i think ?) which Mr. H and I assumed was shrimp tempura on the inside but the entire roll was deep fried ( makes me think the menu is very clear).</li><li>The sashimi was okay, the roll was okay.</li><li>I ended up ordering 4 different roll and finished it by myself.</li><li>I realized the roll is very small in size but not by pieces.</li><li>Apparently their most popular roll is the tataki attack and it lived up to the hype.</li><li>We also tried the blue fin tuna tartar only offered on weekends, the lion roll, crazy roll and the small sushi and maki combo.</li><li>We had agedashi tofu ( crispy tofu in teriyaki sauce), electric banana ( which was weird at first but actually quite tasty), beautiful roll ( scallop, avocado, smoked salmon), yam tempura.</li><li>We ordered the calamari, tataki roll, beautiful roll and a miso soup.</li><li>We ordered a dynamite roll, spicy salmon and crazy roll I think ( the one with spicy scallop) Rolls were all fresh and tasted good.</li><li>Spring Roll was excellent, very fresh, very crispy, highly recommend.</li><li>I order their veggie bento box, which comes with tempera, rice, salad, soup, a roll and a side dish ( different ones, depends on the day).</li><li>I came for dinner at about 6pm and ordered the sweet potato tempura, harumaki ( spring roll), crunch roll, green dragon roll and red bean ice cream.</li><li>The layer of rice is thin, the roll diameter is big but half of it is filled with yam.</li><li>The sauce on this roll is excellent and they have avocado in it.</li><li>The roll is quite big so if you do n't have a huge, huge appetite, it may be worth pawning a few rolls off to your friend or packing it home ( word of warning- it is not as good once it 's cooled down).</li><li>Their sexy summer roll was great too, topped with mango sauce and has mango inside.</li><li>There was only a very small amount of crab and the roll did not look very good.</li><li>Do n't order the roll with strawberry sauce or wtv. on it.</li><li>The roll is made with mango, crab meat salad, and mint leaves topped with a spicy mango sauce.</li><li>I thought the roll was sweet, but tasted wonderful despite the lack of any real spiciness.</li><li>The crazy love roll were great too.</li><li>The rice paper was not of good quality and the roll itself was not very flavorful.</li><li>I got assorted sashimi, philadelphia rolls, fantastic roll ( torched Salmon with asparagus) and dynamite rolls.</li><li>The layer of rice on the outside of the roll is thin, and the sesame seeds add a nice chew.</li><li>I usually get the dynamite roll ( one roll is probably enough for one person) and the sushi bong special and that is more than enough for my wife and I. Sushi Bong is amazing!</li><li>I would recommend their Unagi special roll is the best, dynamic roll and spicy salmon are top 2 on my list.</li><li>Recommendations: Dynamite Roll is byfar their most popular roll.</li><li>Each roll is also easily double and sometimes triple the size of a normal sushi restaurant.</li><li>The crab meat in the roll is real crab meat not crab sticks but I think it would taste even better with crab sticks ...</li><li>STOP PUTTING SESAME SEEDS ALL OVER EVERYTHING !!! i thought the roll was deep fried because i was covered in this stuff !!!</li><li>The roll was pretty good and came fast.</li><li>The spider roll was so long, the whole roll could not be fitted across the container but cut in half.</li><li>The shrimp tempura in the roll was also obviously old and re-fried as it was very hard and looked extremely stale.- and finally, the spicy salmon roll.</li><li>The Yam Tempura roll was also bland while the California roll was alright.</li><li>The roll was really good- better than I expected.</li><li>Hamachi hand roll tasted like it was scraped up from the bottom of a dumpster.</li><li>Fresh roll with shrimp: 1 order comes with 2 decent sized rolls.</li><li>I just might upgrade from my devotion to open-ended egg rolls for this sophisticated roll.</li><li>I asked the man working there if he could possibly make me a specific type of roll that they did n't have displayed and with no hesitation he complied.</li><li>Salmon sushi pizza Salmon sushi hand roll Salmon sushi $ 38.40 Rice tasted weird Sushi had a stale after taste Drowned my salmon sushi in soya sauce and it still did n't help get rid of the awful aftertaste They charge you extra for fish eggs ( The girl kept telling me it was 5 cents extra and they charged me $ 2.50 When I spoke to the manager he said it was 50 cents extra per order) The girl taking my order could n't spell or understand English The food was awful, I usually order from Vip sushi whose prices and food taste way better.</li><li>Sashimi on the top of the rolls were fresh but the roll itself has too much rice which fills you up really fast.</li><li>Ca n't rmm the roll he got but it was okay.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
