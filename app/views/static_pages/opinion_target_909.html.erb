<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 909' %><h2>patio area<br />occurrence: 5</h2><div><ol><li>The curry itself is amazing and not too spicy and the beef is tender on the inside and has a light crispy outside. i ca n't get myself to try any of the other mains! for apps i 've tried their mango salad ( note that there 's coriander in it, which I hate and mint leaves which I also do n't like), beef satay ( not bad), and their fried calamari ( I would get this again and loved the honey chili dipping sauce it came with). desserts I 've tried their mango sticky rice ( the mango was not sweet and really hard) and their deep fried banana with honey ( just standard). the decor here is super cool and there 's a nice patio area for the summer, I love this place!</li><li>I asked, `` is there any drink specials ?'' she immediately walked away muttering with her back turned to us- `` i 'll get your server'' The only logic we came to the conclusion is that she is in charge of the patio area- and she is utterly disappointed that she wont have the pleasure of serving us.</li><li>It has a patio area for some strange reason ( I never thought Chinese people were big on patios, but meh) and it 's definitely your upscale congee house.</li><li>The restaurant has about 5 small tables outside but the patio area faces the parking lot.</li><li>Beer makes me happy. this was ok --- SUMMARY --- Plus 's: good place to hang out, decent food, Minus 's: sitting on the patio means breathing all the car exhaust from the cars on Yonge street --- MORE DETAILS --- we choose a platter for two ... it consisted of: very tender chicken ( i picked it up and a piece of meat fell off- SO TENDER) first time i had cornbread- it looked burnt on the bottom, so i just ate the top part not bad ( it would n't ' be my first choice) pulled pork was ok chicken wings were fairly good beef brisket was pretty good .. ribs were kinda dry ... in the end everything kinda tasted the same. fries were good- not too salty. stepping in, the restaurant itself is nice, there are booths or table seating indoors. the main window is a garage front that opens into the patio area facing yonge st. interior has exposed beam ceilings and there 's many nostalgic memorabilia decorated throughout. we ordered a couple of things from the menu 1. spaghetti with beef brisket- yeah i know an experimental dish but i was feeling like spaghetti and if the brisket was good -- you know that would been amazing. unfortunately the brisket was covered in tomato sauce so I could n't taste it in it 's full glory or not ..</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
