Loves Roll and their bento boxes are the best!</li><li>I requested that the sashimi and the rolls all be salmon.</li><li>The salmon was really fresh.</li><li>The salmon was really good, the tuna was terrible and left uneaten.</li><li>The chirasu sashimi, except for the red tuna ( odd), were quite thin, as well, the salmon on the dragon rolls were even thinner.</li><li>16 dollars .. i am a sushi lover and i have been to many if not almost all the ayce sushi places in GTA ... i can tell you this place cuts the THINNEST sashimi i have ever seen. salmon is transparent ..</li><li>Their salmon head looks like its overly dry on the outside but the inside is still quite moist and juicy.</li><li>The salmon was overdone ( I have yet to have a properly cooked salmon terriyaki anywhere though).</li><li>The salmon was overdone ( I have yet to have a properly cooked salmon terriyaki anywhere though).</li><li>We ordered the Matsu sushi combo and it had salmon, snapper, tuna nigiri and a California and salmon roll.</li><li>White tuna, red tuna, salmon, etc.</li><li>There was pretty much no variety of sushi fish, with only salmon, tuna, red snapper, and shrimp.</li><li>Their small sashimi dinner was very standard ( salmon, tuna, tai, hamachi) nothing outstanding.</li><li>My fav was probably the spicy salmon.</li><li>I 'm used to the larger portions of leafy greens and huge chunks of tuna, salmon etc from Sushi On Bloor and the price is only $ 7.95.</li><li>Grandma had Salmon ( $ 17.99) and was in love with it.</li><li>The souvlaki is ginormous and the salmon is delicious.</li><li>My friend ordered sushi and the salmon was n't fresh.</li><li>We come here every weekend, the salmon and the tuna are always spectacular.</li><li>I got the spicy salmon rolls and lunch bento ( chicken katsu) with salad and two sides ( deep fried japchae roll and salmon).</li><li>We split the assorted regular sashimi which came with salmon, tuna, surf clam, and some sort of white fish.</li><li>The Salmon is the only fresh ones ...</li><li>It has raw shrimp, salmon, white fish, white tuna, and hamachi.</li><li>Their cooked dishes ( teriyaki chicken, teriyaki salmon, etc.) are not too special but what really impresses me is their yam maki.</li><li>The fish was pretty fresh and on par with other Japanese restaurants and they even provided two pieces of the higher quality cuts of salmon which are fattier than the common salmon pieces and so much more yummier.</li><li>The sashimi had salmon, red tuna and white tuna, which was average like all other typical Japanese places.</li><li>Besides the usual sashimi slices of salmon, tuna, and tai, there were also warm saucy unagi slices and mini nigiri of spicy tuna mixed with crunchy tempura bits all laid out scrumptiously on a bed of sweet and vinegary warm rice.</li><li>The colour of the salmon was a disgusting faded orange colour as if it were sitting for awhile.</li><li>The sushi is n't the best in terms of how it was rolled, but they stuff those things incredibly full of spicy salmon and stuff, so I would n't be surprised if they burst when they tried to cut them.</li><li>The sashimi, especially the salmon, was sliced in such chunky pieces I felt like I was eating a raw piece of salmon filet instead of sashimi.</li><li>The salmon was thinly sliced and deliciously fresh.</li><li>I was really excited to see some very interesting items that I do n't normally find at Japanese AYCE places which included salmon tataki ( raw salmon thinly sliced seared with a vinegary sauce), beef tataki, and scallop sashimi.</li><li>The sashimi here is really fresh and salmon was nice thick pieces which I do n't usually see at AYCE places.</li><li>Desserts come in shot glasses so we ordered about 20 ...:) The sushi is pretty fresh by Toronto standards- especially the salmon.</li><li>Everything from crabmeat, salmon, eel, and shrimp.</li><li>Tried a variety of fish, photo added is of salmon, white tuna, squid, and mackerel.</li><li>Fish was fresh, but I 've had nicer salmon.</li><li>The salmon is well prepared and cooked.</li><li>BK.- legit Chinese joint in a very odd neighborhood.- am consistently surprised to see this place full of chinese folks- which confirms the legit-ness- their house congee ( salmon, shrimp. surf clam, grouper, and other seafood) is a steal at 5.95 for a bowl that can serve at least 2 people.</li><li>Lunch bento were ok- the best being the salmon and beef teriyaki.</li><li>The only thing that was n't chewy was the salmon which was n't very fresh and was mostly mushy.</li><li>The salmon was very fresh and the tempura was light and crispy.</li><li>It had spicy tuna, spicy California, and spicy salmon.</li><li>The salmon tasted weird and that totally turned me off from all my food.</li><li>I 'm super paranoid after that worldwide raw salmon scare that made everyone very sick a few years ago.</li><li>My aunt ordered the Seafood Creole ( $ 16)- shrimp, calamari, clams, salmon, mussels, linguine pasta, and a marinara sauce.</li><li>The salmon tasted out of place and overcooked, and there were quite a few bones.</li><li>Ordered the Toronto roll ( crabmeat, spicy salmon, yam tempura, avocado I think) and Unagi Maki roll ( bbq eel).</li><li>The salmon was good and moist.</li><li>I love my salmon too, I was very disappointed.</li><li>We got lucky that even part of our salmon sashimi were salmon belly.</li><li>We ordered the escargot, seafood platter ( I think that 's what it was called, it consisted of shrimp, salmon, lobster tail, and another type of fish ... all very delicious), and 1.5lbs of lobster broiled ( highly recommend very delicious), garlic bread, and baked potato.</li><li>There 's a pretty generous serving of giant shrimps, salmon, scallops, squid, and some other fish in each bowl.</li><li>HUGE pieces of Shrimp, Crab, Surf Clams, Salmon, Garoupa and other stuff.</li><li>I ordered the Super House Congee- it came with shrimp, crab, salmon, scallop, grouper and green onions.</li><li>The salmon got a greyish colour on the side ... i assume the quality is not very high.</li><li>Portions are hefty and they 're generous with their salmon.</li><li>Highly recommend- dynamite rolls, sushi bong special, spicy salmon, rainbow ... etc.</li><li>Now that they got their customers LOCKED, they jacked up prices by a bit also the rice and salmon has changed to a lower quality, also the owner is very rude never says anything just walks around and bumps people on shoulders with no apologies.</li><li>I would recommend their Unagi special roll is the best, dynamic roll and spicy salmon are top 2 on my list.</li><li>Their California rolls actually have salmon in them which is quite surprising.</li><li>The salmon was fresh and everything was fresh.</li><li>Of the three rolls the best was the Spicy Salmon roll. which was crunchy and had the right amount of spicy as well salmon was good in it.</li><li>Sashimi was okay but the tilapia was coarsely chopped and the salmon has the grey edge attached.</li><li>I always get the california, spicy salmon, and spicy tuna, all extra crunchy.</li><li>The dynamite roll and spicy salmon are my go to rolls and they are deliciously huge and stuffed with ingredients.</li><li>We ordered spicy salmon, dragon roll ( shrimp tempura) and spider roll.</li><li>Cheap, creative but definitely did n't quite hit the spot and did n't taste the way spicy salmon is done elsewhere in the city.</li><li>The Spider roll was unconventional in that it contained egg, avocado, cucumber, salmon ( ?), and soft shell crab.</li><li>Salmon was super fresh.</li><li>You get 5 pieces of sushi, an 8 piece California roll and 4 pieces of salmon maki all for under $ 10.</li><li>I got take out and the order was done within 20 min, i got the spider, red dynamite, sushi bong special ( 5 piece sushi with salmon and white tuna, salmon maki and California.</li><li>I usually really do n't like the California roll because i think it 's a waste of space- no raw fish, but this one had salmon !!</li><li>The salmon is always fresh and melts in your mouth.</li><li>We always get a dynamite roll and a spicy salmon or tuna roll for take out and it 's ready so quickly.</li><li>Came back and wanted to try other things on the menu and bought a White Tuna &amp; Green Onion Maki, Hae Du Bap, and a Small Sashimi ( 36pcs) but there was literally 11pcs of salmon, 11 pcs white tuna/butterfish, 12 pcs tilapia, 2 pcs of hokkigai/surf clam.</li><li>The sashimi was pretty gross mostly because of the giant cuts of tilapia, felt like i was eating cuts of raw tilapia steaks and the salmon tasted a little fishy and the white tuna/butterfish was a whole lot fishier.</li><li>The Hae Du Bap had like about 80g of chopped up assorted fish in which about 25% of it was chewy salmon yuck.</li><li>I always opt for the Sushi Bong Special, which is 5 pcs Sushi, 8 pcs California Roll, and 4 pcs Salmon Maki .. for 9.50, and the size of each piece is significant.</li><li>I got the spicy salmon, dynamite and spicy mayo on the side ( 50c extra BTW).</li><li>Presentation is absent but they make up for it in quick and speedy delivery of food, bundled with overly large rolls stuffed with raw salmon or tuna, or tempura, whatever most sushi lovers desire.</li><li>The salmon was a bit burned a bit otherwise really tasty.</li><li>- The philadelphia roll was made with cooked salmon ... the same kind of boiled salmon that I ate in my congee the day before.</li><li>I ordered the Sashimi lunch ( 10pc raw for $ 12.98) salmon was good !! the rest was ok, not bad.</li><li>For $ 39 you can get a platter of 48 maki rolls from Tako Sushi on Don Mills but the quality is sub-par and they 're just plain salmon, tuna, cucumber, and California rolls.</li><li>The rice was a good portion, but the only sashimi that seemed fresh and not defrosted was the salmon.</li><li>The rice is very vinegary and went well with the salmon.</li><li>The California rolls were fresh but the salmon, unfortunately, was not.</li><li>The first time I got food from here I got the Dynamite roll and the spicy salmon, both were very fresh and very delicious.</li><li>I love their fancy all day breakfast, especially `` Natasha''. mmmm ... salmon, caviar, cream cheese on eggs, fries and try the rye toast it has that crunch Or try the `` truckers breakfast'' that comes with pancakes.</li><li>Tried the Eggs Natasha $ 13- poached eggs with smoked salmon on pancakes with home fries ( 4/5 stars).</li><li>Spicy Salmon Roll/Salmon/Tuna ( $ 5.99)- 6 pieces of Spicy Salmon roll has quite a bit of salmon and Tempura bites- Salmon and Tuna are both standard- Rice has a good balance of vinegar, nice and bouncy chew ...</li><li>I ordered House B, and my friend had House D. The House B combo included assorted sushi ( including salmon, shrimp, and fake crab), a california roll ( 6 pcs), spicy salmon roll ( 6 pcs), and a crispy avocado hand roll.</li><li>I love the maki rolls here, especially the spicy salmon.</li><li>It was a special that requires a group of 8, everyone got a few maki/sushi rolls, a bowl of salad, miso soup, fried rice, a shrimp, a scallop, chicken, mixed veggies, salmon and steak.</li><li>I have the smoked salmon, And it was basically just three slices of very thin salmon with some potatoes on the side Which costed $ 12.</li><li>My favourite tray has the 6 pieces of mix sushi, 4 pieces of Cali maki and spicy salmon, seaweed salad and shrimp sushi and it 's only $ 10.</li><li>The quality of the salmon is very good.</li><li>Sashimi options were standard- salmon, white tuna, surf clam, kani, egg ... etc.</li><li>Over all the the portion of the rice is too much and the quality of the salmon is OK but it is very thin.</li><li>Their spicy salmon roll had a lot of `` crispy'' things and very little salmon.</li><li>They have a great selection of desserts. sashimi seems pretty fresh altho we usually only eat salmon.</li><li>The spicy tuna and salmon looked old, and red dragon and dynamite broke apart in my chop sticks due to them being so loosely rolled.</li><li>Found this place very close to my work. superb food and smiling customer service all around. tried their chicken, cod fish and salmon and all of them were just perfect.</li><li>Salmon was juicy and salad was fresh and crispy.</li><li>The Hollandaise sauce was good and it is a really good combination with the salmon underneath the egg, since the salmon is a salty on its own.</li><li>The Hollandaise sauce was good and it is a really good combination with the salmon underneath the egg, since the salmon is a salty on its own.</li><li>The veggies are cooked to perfection and fresh, and the salmon is well seared and the sauce was tasty as well.</li><li>You should also try the Spicy Maki Bento during lunch hours: 6 spicy salmon + 6 spicy tuna + salad + miso soup + an orange.</li><li>The salmon did not taste or smell fishy at all, which is an obvious good sign as it indicated how fresh the fish was.</li><li>The Caterpillar roll had tasty BBQ eel and a flavourful combination with cucumber, avocado, and tobiko and the Alaska roll was straightforward with tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and avocado.</li><li>Try the salmon or tuna Tataki And they have really good speciality rolls The only thing I can complain about is the alcohol choices .. besides fancy girl drinks the beer selection is not too good The sushi is on par with any place I 've tried I would consider this place average to above average ..</li><li>The salmon was passable, the rye bread was tough, dry, and semi-stale.</li><li>I 've tried NY steaks, prime rib, duck, salmon.</li><li>Though I enjoy salmon, I have never had smoked salmon before.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
