<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 114' %><h2>bibimbap<br />occurrence: 58</h2><div><ol><li>Not-so-great eats for me have been: spider roll ( the soft shell crab is panko breadcrumb crusted instead of tempura fried, I find it does n't taste as good), sukiyaki ( raw meats and noodles cooked in broth fondue style) and bibimbap ( korean stone bowl rice dish, which was done poorly).</li><li>They also have plenty of more traditional dishes like cold noodles, bibimbap etc.</li><li>I got the bibimbap and my friend got the ginseng chicken soup.</li><li>The bibimbap was quite good as well; it came with an assortment of vegetables, raw veal and a raw egg on top allowing you to cook said egg and veal to your liking in the hot stone pot.</li><li>Pay the extra couple dollars for bibimbap in the hot stone pot-it 's worth it!</li><li>I can describe the bibimbap and other items in the same manner.</li><li>The veggies are perfectly saut√©ed and very vibrant, which makes for a beautiful bibimbap.</li><li>The bibimbap comes with a soup ( chicken soup unfortunately) and ranges between $ 11-15, which is on the more expensive end of bibimbaps.</li><li>But if you do n't mind these little details, come to Koryo for some authentic, delicious bibimbap ( they do takeout too)!</li><li>They allow some weird substitutions too, I went with a friend who wanted her bibimbap minus the `` bap'' lol ..</li><li>Best bibimbap ever!</li><li>Hot Stone Bibimbap The bibimbap was hot and there were loads of toppics.</li><li>I can already tell it 's pricey because bibimbap here is $ 11.99.</li><li>I tried the ginseng chicken soup, the bibimbap with the raw veal, the kimchi fried rice with hotstone and a few things which I could n't remember.</li><li>I got the bibimbap, it was decent but I do n't think I would go back.</li><li>I had the hot stone raw bibimbap.</li><li>Ginseng chicken soup- tender, flavourful, delicious Bibimbap- classic, crispy, aromatic SO MANY SIDE DISHES!</li><li>The price range for the chicken soup ( $ 16) and bibimbap ( $ 13) was a bit higher than your typical korean joint, so we were expecting some above average quality.</li><li>The bibimbap had raw veal and mushrooms with all the other typically bibimbap ingredients.</li><li>I 've never experienced this, but although the stone pot for my bibimbap was hot, the rice did my even stick to the pot to create that slight crust of rice this dish is known for.</li><li>I ordered the bibimbap ( $ 10.99).</li><li>Both korean ginseng soup and bibimbap are relatively lighter and more delicate tasting items in my opinion.</li><li>I 've had the bibimbap.</li><li>The bibimbap was nice as well and tasted good with the Korean hot sauce.</li><li>This is the go-to place for lunch for a few folks in the office and I. The lunch offerings are typically Korean ( bibimbap, various jjigae, and some bulgogee sets) and the prices are right.</li><li>Of course, if you do n't want AYCE, you can order many regular a la carte dishes like pork bone soup or bibimbap.</li><li>We were going to order a bibimbap, but when we placed the order, the server came back to us immediately and apologized that they were out of cooked rice for which to make our bibimbap.</li><li>Our favourites are the ddeokbokki, steamed mandu ( SO GOOD), grilled mackerel, bibimbap, mul/bibim-naengmyeon, and honestly most soups.</li><li>As far as the food went, I ordered the bibimbap, which came sizzling hot.</li><li>Their bibimbap was really good though and my brother seemed to enjoy his pork bulgogi hot pot with rice!</li><li>We ordered the Bibimbap, beef tofu soup, and grilled bulgogi.</li><li>There are basically only 3 menu options- bibimbap, bulgogi and soon tofu ( 5 versions of soon tofu but still basically the same dish).</li><li>The side dishes were average, I still prefer Joons or Oh Geul Boh Geuls side dishes but moving on, the menu was fairly simple it had variations of soon tofu, bulgogi and bibimbap.</li><li>The bibimbap was good.</li><li>The food itself came out pretty quickly and the bibimbap was definitely tasty but I would n't call it the best in Toronto, not by a long shot.</li><li>The soups and bibimbap are amazing.</li><li>Options are limited to a few dishes but bibimbap will always stand out for me.</li><li>The bibimbap comes out in a sizzling stone bowl with a variety of sauteed vegetables on top of sticky rice.</li><li>The bibimbap is great too .. all with fresh veggies.</li><li>The bibimbap is really good, although I wish they would add more beef to it.</li><li>The bibimbap comes with gochujang ( otherwise you have to pay 50 cents extra for it), and it 's the really thick kind that you have to smear onto your rice, rather that squeeze from a bottle.</li><li>At $ 13 ( tax incl) though, the bibimbap is a little pricey.</li><li>My coworker and I spent the entire afternoon chugging down water to try and balance the amount of salt in the soup and kimchi We got 2x combination 1 ( $ 8.85), which had exactly 1 shrimp ( mini one) and 1 mussel, and maybe 2 bites of beef The bibimbap ( $ 11.51) had no beef ( we had to send t back to the kitchen) Awful experience, good service though.</li><li>The place has the usual soon tofu, bibimbap and a soup/grilled bulgolgi.</li><li>Their bibimbap is also very good.</li><li>My Korean friend said this place is known from its pork bone soup, but I can say that the bibimbap and tteokbokki were sooooo good.</li><li>I do n't usually come here, and I was craving bibimbap.</li><li>We ordered food to go:- bibimbap ( 3/5) Pretty good but I guess not the best take out option- bulgogi ( 4/5) Very yummy and not overly greasy- glass noodles ( 5/5) Delicious!</li><li>I never knew how bad bibimbap could be until you tasted slimy vegetables from the cucumber.</li><li>Traditionally bibimbap is also supposed to be served in a stone bowl which I love, they served it in a typical plastic noodle bowl. =/* Over view* I will never be visiting this place and to their other locations ( I believe I ate once at at FMP- First Markham Place, and never will again).</li><li>If I 'm ever craving a good bibimbap, I 'll take TTC to eat either at Kimichi House ( at Dundas Station) or multiple places at Christie Station.</li><li>Their bibimbap in a stone bowl is also very tasty when you add the extra hot sauce.</li><li>Pros: bottomless appetizers, gyoza ( TO DIE FOR), fast service ( although not the friendliest), bibimbap!</li><li>Almost all of their dishes are better than those in other Korean restaurants around the area. pork bone soup, tofu soondubu soup, beef sullungtang soup, and bibimbap are all soooo good.</li><li>They have excellent bibimbap and some special spicy squid dish.</li><li>Ordered a whole bunch of food to share including: 1) Pork Bone Soup- $ 9.99 2) Samgyeopsal- BBQ Bacon and soup ( for 2 ppl)- $ 32.99 3) &amp; 4) Bibimbap- $ ?? 5) Side dishes- Free 1) Pork bone soup is really good, the consistency of the soup is slightly thicker than what you would get from any other place.</li><li>Their sauce of the Albap is different from the regular bibimbap.</li><li>Of course, if you are n't looking for BBQ, they have other standard fares like bibimbap.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
