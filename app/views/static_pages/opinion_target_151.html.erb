<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 151' %><h2>seats<br />occurrence: 44</h2><div><ol><li>5. good environment, could have better seats.</li><li>It was 630 p.m. ( on a Sunday nite) and it was packed to capacity ( 42 seats).</li><li>It is n't their fault all the seats are taken, maybe Bayview Village needs its own Starbucks rather then only having this tiny one inside Chapters ?</li><li>The place looks really modern and chic at first glance, but when we actually went to a booth to sit down, the seats were cracked and the table was oily ...</li><li>The sushi bar is excellent for the following reasons: a) the seats are comfortable and have backs so you can hang your coat, b) they are high enough so that you 're not looking up at the sushi cooler and c) the activity behind the bar is theatrical.</li><li>The seats were spacious, I was able to fit a car seat on the bench with me, in case anyone is looking for a child-friendly eatery, this definitely qualifies.</li><li>They demanded that we order at least 8 dishes since we are occupying 8 seats.</li><li>I heard they have nicer tables up front, but our table, while private, was quite cramped for three people, and our table and our booth seats were n't parallel and we could n't move either of them, so it made for an awkward seating experience.</li><li>However it is not recommended for large groups of people, b/c seats are not moveable and tables are set for only about 6 people.</li><li>We are usually able to get the seats we prefer, by the window, even when it 's quite busy, which happens occasionally, mostly on weekends.</li><li>Tables and seats were dirty full of food particles not wiped properly.</li><li>Location in strip mall is handy for quick shopping trips. its small and seats might be hard to find.</li><li>There is 6 side dishes ( it 's delicious) but no refills ( 75 cents per dish refill) They seat 2 people at the 6 person tables, which I think is a bit ridiculously, they should rearrange the seats around so they can maximize the amount of people that can be seated at this restaurant, so there is n't always people waiting.</li><li>The seats are much closer and crowded.</li><li>Side note, there are a few seats available if you want to eat in.</li><li>Partitions of sorts do n't truly block you from neighbouring seats.</li><li>The seats are half broken and I was definitely sitting on a replacement cheap chair tonight.</li><li>It 's a small store underneath a condo building, with very few seats for dine-ins.</li><li>They have seats inside but its very limited and take out is your best bet.</li><li>There are few seats and most people order ahead for takeout.</li><li>Pros: huge bowls ( beef noodle soup $ 9.99, cold noodles $ 6.99- medium size but filling), handmade noodles in North York, a good size menu Cons: tiny shop ( has 4 2-person seats and bar stools for 5-ppl, even though it 's handmade it 's not as chewy as I 'd like I like this place because it 's not easy to find handmade Chinese noodles in the Yonge/finch-to-Shep area.</li><li>Hard wooden seats.</li><li>There 's around 5 tables along one side and a bar with four seats along the other wall.</li><li>There are about 12 seats in the entire place.</li><li>Those 12 seats are pretty crammed too.</li><li>This is my second time here, came here Saturday around 3pm and got the last 2 seats.</li><li>Place is extremely small with only 14 seats.</li><li>4 of the seats were along the wall while the other 10 at tables on the other side.</li><li>The seats were comfy though.</li><li>Their seats are also in these sectioned booths, which is great if you have a group because it makes it more intimate.</li><li>We were almost going to leave after a long few minutes until they finally brought us to empty seats.</li><li>Why did we have to wait to be seated when then were many empty seats and tables ???</li><li>Unexpected but at the moment those are the most comfy seats of any Soon Tofu place I 've been.</li><li>My only complaint is that the seats are really tight and I always find my chair bumping into other chairs and I 'm forced to squeeze in.</li><li>The place was busy but still had empty seats.</li><li>There are many seniors here chatting away and keeping all seats occupied.</li><li>There is a counter with 4 seats, otherwise food court seating is on the lower level, at the other end of the mall.</li><li>The store is quite small and oddly shaped; its triangular shape means that the seats are often too close to anybody walking by.</li><li>When I came in to get us seats, the restaurant seemed pretty full with young families.</li><li>The best seats are near the entrance ( so that you can people watch and it 's more open).</li><li>We got a booth which was cozy bus-style seats.</li><li>Bright ambience, comfy seats.</li><li>While my food was great and I thought the seats were extremely comfortable ( we were in a booth), my husband found the booth uncomfortable and the food just pretty good.</li><li>Only about 20-25 seats, but a quick execution and a high turnover means you should n't be afraid of a line.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
