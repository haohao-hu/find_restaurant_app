eggs, so I had someone try it.</li><li>Mind you, it 's hard to mess up on a breakfast meal of eggs, sausage, peameal bacon, homefries &amp; toast.</li><li>Bacon came cold, like it was fried the day before and sat in a pan under the heating light, and our eggs were over cooked.</li><li>The eggs even though I ordered soft, only one of them was.</li><li>Strawberry Waffles are usually a hit (

melt.</li><li>The food came out really fast ( under 5 minutes) but was just ok, my eggs were a little over cooked from what I asked, and my toast was barely buttered at all.</li><li>Prioritizing was clearly not in order at this restaurant and I could clearly see the waiters and supervisors/managers scrambling to multitask orders but not their eggs ( horribly corny pun intended).</li><li>My

1 hash brown, and a coffee.</li><li>Unless you like tasteless, undercooked eggs and onions with onions that seem to have been sauteed a couple days before, do n't.</li><li>Scramble eggs were ah nothing special and the salad was just a salad with no special flavours.</li><li>Ca n't say I was a fan of the eggs and lox.</li><li>Heard great things about this place came by for Sunday brunch but was disappointed we ordered the eggs benedict the steak and eggs and a kids meal my eggs were blanched not post and vastly undercooked unfortunately the steak was a little salty and not perfectly consistent with the other orders we saw coming out by the end of everything with one extra orange juice the bill was close to $ 50 we waited for service and the wait staff seems he prioritizing Cutlery over bringing us additional copies and our bill not thrilled So I have been here twice and heir breakfast ends at 3 pm.</li><li>My husband tried to steer away from a Benedict and got the

options ( e.g. fruit, omelettes, crêpes, eggs, etc.)</li><li>My family and I have never ate at the teppenyaki area of the restaurant ... we do not need to see chefs juggling eggs and pepper shakers-

and waffles and my eggs did n't taste or have the texture of scrambled eggs- it was like the eggs you get at McDonalds when you order a big breakfast.</li><li>Symposim is a lot like the café mirage.symposium is a great place for breakfast but let me warn you they have so much trouble in the accuracy of my order I almost do n't wanna go back.Even though I like their breakfast/Brunch.I do n't recommend Going at dinner or lunch because the food slides down.doiring dinner and sometimes lunch everyday they have specials that have not very good food for a decent price.Their accuracy is bad

bring cash and you pay at the cashier. soooooo, did you hear about what happened to the goldsteins ? how about the shmaltzbergs son michael, i heard he got an earring! no ? really. what a hoodlum. oy a broch. this might make virtually no sense to you at all or it might make all too much sense to you and either way when you are eating in the cramped space that is bagel plus youll hear this conversation in any number of incarnations at much louder decibel levels than in this review. right at the lip of one of torontos jewish areas ( spanning from as far south as eglinton you might say to as far north as sheppard all along bathurst as its spine) sits this boisterous place thats half bakery and takeaway and half sit down. there are classic chopped eggs, tuna, lox, cream cheese, and herring. then they have a bit of middle eastern flair with falafel plates. the falafel are huge and crispy. they also, make a great spinach salad with a huge ice cream scoop of chopped egg- im sure you can get a huge scoop of just about anything on it. and just about anything you get, will come with, as you would expect, a nice big bagel. i always enjoy my food whenever i go- the menu has long been set and they do it well, but i could do with a little less all the bar mitzvah talk. but when in poland ...</li><li>Bagel- nothing special, rather dry Eggs- omg, do they cook them weeks in advance ?</li><li>It comes with 3 eggs, toast and potatoes but we ask for sliced tomatoes and cukes instead ... trying to cut down on the fried foods ... yeah, yeah, I know my eggs were n't poached.</li><li>It comes with 3 eggs, toast and potatoes but we ask for sliced tomatoes and cukes instead ... trying to cut down on the fried foods ... yeah, yeah, I know my eggs were n't

mess up.</li><li>I barely got through the eggs Benedict and still had a full side of home fries!</li><li>I ordered the soup of the day ( beef macaroni) for the baby she loved it and so did I. I ordered the breakfast poutine which was home fries covered in cut up breakfast sausage cheese and gravy with 2 eggs any style on the top.</li><li>$ 10 for 3 eggs, bacon, home fries, toast and coffee.</li><li>It includes two pancakes, three eggs any style but I wanted them scrambled, two ham, two sausages, two bacon and home fries!</li><li>My eggs and meat were delicious!</li><li>The eggs were so runny that we could soak up the English muffin and there would still be leftover yolk!</li><li>The eggs were perfectly poached and combination of flavors was delicious!</li><li>My boyfriend ordered the omelette breakfast and I opted for the breakfast special ( with eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, toast, home fried potatoes and pancakes).</li><li>Ordered over-medium once and received over easy, which was unappetising and went uneaten ... love this mom and pops place! the staff is quite friendly and the owner always greets us personally whenever he 's around. i have personally only ever ordered from their all day breakfast menu so i ca n't speak for their lunch and dinner but it is the best breakfast at the most decent price. while i have ordered many breakfast dishes, my favorite go-to is the eggs benedict with smoked salmon and asparagus. i must have had this dish once a week for the past year and it 's been cooked to perfection every time. the sauce is not too heavy, not too light. the eggs are always made the way you like it- i make sure i get them to soft poach them. home fries are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. weekend mornings and brunch time get pretty busy but it is always worth the wait:) Solid breakfast choice if you 're in that area.</li><li>Came here today in search of the legendary eggs and bacon breakfast.</li><li>I 've gotten the eggs Benedict, the club sandwich and the eggs and bacon and all have really good.</li><li>3 eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, home fries, toast and pancakes.</li><li>My sunny side up eggs were perfect Basically, come here for brunch.</li><li>Boyfriend got the eggs and steak.</li><li>The eggs and bacon were tasty, however the pancakes and French toast left something to be desired and were n't worth the calories.</li><li>The first time I got eggs Benny as suggested by our friendly waitress.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
