<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 67' %><h2>beer<br />occurrence: 115</h2><div><ol><li>There was a large group of youngsters who were already beyond their drinking capacities when we walked in ( I immediately remembered Karl R with his Irish-Korean comparison), who were later joined by an old white man in even better condition getting another beer as if he had not had enough already.</li><li>It 's got beer.</li><li>Get the 5 beer and entr√©e deal ...</li><li>Upon consuming the one pitcher of beer and devouring the 2lbs of wings and fries, we were approached by a server in regards to the bill, and we mutually relayed the notion of splitting the bill- the price of the pitcher would be covered by my colleague, and I would pay for the 2lbs of wings + fries.</li><li>So all in all I think his place is worth your time if all you want is to enjoy a good game, a beer and a burger.</li><li>Did n't really like the snooty/lazy service already ... ' bartendress' behaving as if I 'm some sort of dumb-a $ $ for not knowing all the brands of domestic beer ... maybe i am but I would n't expect a tip if you feel so inclined to talk down to me!</li><li>Decided to sit out on the patio to grab some sun and the waitress was smiley &amp; friendly &amp; served me my bottle ... she was also kind enough to let me know that the bar rail was the same price as the domestic beer.</li><li>Great food, very chill atmosphere and great drinks ( Asahi Black is an amazing beer you ca n't get at lot of other places).</li><li>They lost one star because the last time I came the waitress accidentally brought my boyfriend the wrong beer.</li><li>And that same night as my boyfriend was drinking his beer he found a chip on the lip of his cup which he was drinking out of the whole night, he was n't angry just annoyed.</li><li>But once again he brought it to her attention, she apologized profusely and replaced his glass immediately with a fresh beer.</li><li>My Asahi can of beer ( $ 10) was n't as cold as it should have been.</li><li>You can place your beer right into the ice and keep it cool for your entire dinner.</li><li>Also free wifi while you wait for your pizza, or eat there, they also serve beer.</li><li>I normally dread having to go to places like this; it 's the combined apprehension of coworker lunchtime ( watching the clock), the resonating belching of military personnel from the nearby base burping loudly into their beer, and the fact that this place smells more like a bar than a restaurant.</li><li>I ended up getting the half dozen and a beer for $ 10.99.</li><li>Honestly, was a great appetizer; which almost filled me up when combined with the beer; Not going to lie.</li><li>My Yelp Friend though quietly ate the whole order with a heavy dose of hot sauce- Toasted corn kernels was offered to us as a side dish to go with the Ceviche which I secretly wish I can wash them down with a beer!</li><li>Half the bottle was adequate for me so I gave the other half to a couple who had just arrived and thought they 'd love the experience of drinking beer and cold sake alternately.</li><li>The beer is cold, the service is good.</li><li>Cozy, quaint, authentic, great service and lunch specials with good portions and also licensed so you can enjoy a glass if wine or beer!</li><li>We 'd been out for hours on a hot day, looked forward to beer, had to settle for pop or water.</li><li>There is red and white wine, beer and cooler which makes it the perfect lunch/dinner.</li><li>Sometimes, you just want a glass of vino with your burger to step it up a notch and take your McDonald-like experience to a whole new level. great burgerBUT messed up my order even tho the large foot tall number token was very obvious. had to leav- left beer- king east location- rap music and noise level was so loud I was shocked no one complained. fries and burger tasty hate that the service was non apparent must line up to order- no table ordering food no condiments on table or napkins even! pros- meal `` deal''. came to 14 $ for small jr burger a fry and a beer. not sure that 's a deal.</li><li>South Street Burger also sells alcoholic drinks- beer and wine.</li><li>I make a 3 km to get here as I wo n't justify $ 7-8 for a pint of beer when I get can get the same thing plus better food at Congress for less.</li><li>Good on them for having beer available though!</li><li>Think dive bars bitter Chemistry grad students frequent after long hours in the lab and then lose the opulence of a beer tap.</li><li>Think of a hot dog cart with a tented seating area and the hot dog cart proprietor can semi-legally sell beer and soju ( a high test Korean paint thinner consumed as a beverage).</li><li>After trying the makkoli, you can proceed to impressively cheap bottled domestic beer ( $ 3.50).</li><li>Came here tonight for some bar food and cold beer.</li><li>It 's my go to location for some good burgers and beer and wings.</li><li>Beer ...</li><li>The one great thing about this place is the Angus Burger &amp; the beer.</li><li>It 's VERY rare that I would write something negative about a restaurant but here is a brief description of my experience at this particular St. Louis last week: When I sat down I was immediately greeted by a waitress who put in my order for a draft beer.</li><li>Noticing she was rather busy I waited patiently for approximately 10 minutes until I got her attention asking her for my beer.</li><li>After a few more minutes I asked again and she rudely said if I looked to my right I would notice that the bartender was having trouble pouring the beer in the glass as it had too much foam.</li><li>The food is always good and the beer is always cold..</li><li>We opted not to get the green beer, however, our kind hostess offered to make a green four leaf clover on the Guinness.</li><li>They have lots of beer on tap, plus lots of big tv 's to watch any game playing.</li><li>The crowd at 12:45pm on a Monday was not the greatest and it smelled like stale beer but whatever, I 'm really not picky ( others would be).</li><li>Good selection of beer including my fave Rickards white.</li><li>Not ordering beer ?</li><li>Seems like the combos with beer are good and this would be a good place to come if you are a group of 6 or more.</li><li>If you like beer they have beer + dish combo 's which are very cheap ( off the top of my head i think it 's ~ $ 25 for a large plate of kanpunggi and 5 domestic beers).</li><li>~ $ 60 special ( that supposedly feeds 5 ..... i had a party of 3: D) consisted of:- pork belly barbeque ( generous portions; fat was able to drip off so it was n't overwhelming)- mussel soup- choice of 1 bottle of sake or 5 bottles of beer- fish stew- buckwheat noodles- the usual table full of side dishes- ( complimentary sample of assorted meats &amp; blood sausage) so. bomb.</li><li>( Plus cheap beer!)</li><li>On the other hand, I found the spicy skews best went with something cold and alcohol ( you guess it: beer).</li><li>It was pretty cold in the arena so the natural thing to do after the game, get beer.</li><li>These guys were mostly there for a cold beer after work ( just $ 3.50 which is very cheap for any place in Toronto) and just added to the colour of the place.</li><li>We came during off hours, and there was basically no one in the restaurant, save for one man nursing a beer ( so I 'm taking they have some sort of liquor license).</li><li>They also serve Italian wine and beer!</li><li>Plus they have beer and wine!</li><li>Ca n't beat a beer and wings here.</li><li>And should not be thought of a chicken place that serves beer.</li><li>You can order beer and soju but I do n't remember seeing much of anything else.</li><li>Korean fried chicken is made for beer and soju- something I 've learned from reading their reasonably priced soju/beer + fried chicken combo menus that cost roughly $ 28.</li><li>Some beer or soju perhaps ? !!!</li><li>The half and half combo with beer is great ( serves 4).</li><li>- It is a great dish to munch over some iced cold beer, sharing with your friends and just talks about nonsense !!</li><li>BTW, the beer here is $ 2.50 a bottle for domestic and $ 3 for an import.</li><li>Stick with the cheap beer for lunch.</li><li>We asked for beer, it did n't come.</li><li>We had to ask for our beer 20 after ordering.</li><li>Two words: cold beer.</li><li>Prices are reasonable- 30 Oysters with sake, a beer, plum wine and the vegetable rolls came to around $ 60.</li><li>Absolutely the best place for chicken wings and beer.</li><li>The place is full of regulars, its great to catch a game, with a beer and wings.</li><li>If you love tiny dry burnt wings, cold undercooked frozen fries, terrible domestic beer, and dozens of Rob Ford articles on every wall, then you will absolutely LOVE this place!</li><li>Everything on the menu is under $ 10 and the beer was $ 4 so this is definitely a great option for a really good, cheap meal.</li><li>The only thing that I was n't happy about is that they do n't serve alcohol beverages when I searched the pictures before going it showed a menu with beer and soju but not the case anymore.</li><li>The place is kind of expensive I ordered spegetti and it was $ 15, a beer was $ 5, and it was n't all that great, I have n't had a lot of italian food but I have definitely had better.</li><li>I had to wait to order a beer in the bar part for 15 min because no one was there.</li><li>They have really good deals on beer, plus many large TV so you never miss a goal.</li><li>There is bound to be one beer you would drink here.</li><li>They have a special where you can order a dish and 4 beers for $ 19.99 which is a good deal considering each beer is $ 3.50 without the special.</li><li>They serve alcohol such as beer and soju, so that 's a plus.</li><li>Lastly, the restaurant is licensed as they serve beer and soju.</li><li>Perhaps the name is appropriate after all, as deciding on a meal of hearty Pork Bone Soup with a nice beer, can at times, be a wise choice indeed ....</li><li>My boyfriend ordered the beer and 2 side orders of rice with soy sauce, since I was n't hungry and he does n't have a big appetite.</li><li>We always order wings, calamari, beer, appetizers and deserts.</li><li>Order up: beef tacos, 3lbs of half jerk and mild wings, nachos, burger, 4 YES 4 large orders of Cesar salad ( insert ironic applause here), deep fried cheesecake, calamari, beer for the hubby and I and plenty of iced tea for the mini.</li><li>Tap selection of beer was pretty weak, only being able to choose between Mill St Organic and Tankhouse, or Ricards Red.</li><li>I had a Stella while the others in my group ordered beer as well.</li><li>During the wait, our waters were filled up without asking, our waitress came around and asked if we wanted more beer as well.</li><li>I saw some people get beer on tap.</li><li>I have n't had a chance to try their beer or wine they have on tap.</li><li>The prices are good and for those that like beer and wine.</li><li>We had ordered- 4 skewers that our waiter suggested, the taadig appetizer, 2 vegeterian appetizers ( olives, and a yogurt blend- both terrific!), 2 glasses of house wine and a beer.</li><li>I started with a draft beer- Asahi.</li><li>Decent selection of sake while a predictable selection for beer.</li><li>After waiting for unreasonable amount of time, we ordered a medium stuffed crust pizza and two pints of beer.</li><li>I was thinking of having a beer, chill and people watching a little along Yonge Strret.</li><li>I mean, Monday is tough already and dealing with ' more mayo and more ketchup' and potentially mixing up beer and milk requires a high level of pretending you give a hoot and playing nice nice all at once.</li><li>( Signs on TTC stops say $ 4/burgers and beer, but in store promotion is $ 5/per).</li><li>On burger night, they have the regular burger and selected beer for $ 4 each.</li><li>The beer was cold and a fairly good selection on tap.</li><li>It 's pretentious and it makes no sense in that the Memphis theme has no connection to the people running the place, but the food was good and the beer was cheap.</li><li>The table next to us also had water, and were served their beer as they were almost finished their meals!</li><li>They serve beer from Amsterdam Brewery and pair it up with many combos in their menu.</li><li>It 's a great place to catch the game, and have a beer.</li><li>The food was sub-par, compared to your typical place that serves burgers and fries, just with a bit more selection in wings, and beer.</li><li>The service on the day I was there was pretty good for a full house, they were attentive, especially to empty glasses sitting at our table, asking if we wanted more water, or beer.</li><li>Beer was decent but server was horrible.</li><li>It 's just disappointing. one of the best st louis wings places. go on tuesdays, get a beer, wings are half price !!! i like cajun, hot, and original buffalo. first floor gets packed quick, so go upstairs, the music is better and you can actually get a table pretty quick. love it!</li><li>This is a place for beer, tv, watching a big sports event etc ...</li><li>The Ceasar is nice and spicy, but I like beer if you know what I mean.</li><li>The space upstairs ( the lounge) is where high school kids come to get some beer in hopes that their IDs wo n't be checked, and in most cases it works.</li><li>My boys made sure they locked in that order with their pitcher of beer.</li><li>If you live on yonge between Shepard and finch this is a good place to grab a beer and watch the game with friends.</li><li>Cheap beer.</li><li>The beer we ordered never came, and neither did a pair of chopsticks ( even though they placed a napkin and placemat down).</li><li>Drinks: A beer that was ordered by one of my friends never materialized.</li><li>I 'd say stick to beer, water or soda pop. Moving into the buffet portion of GHMG, I was really impressed with the organized lay out for food and the overall freshness and organization of the Mongolian BBQ area.</li><li>The interior of the restaurant -- a kind of narrow hallway feeling, the dark wood interior does n't help, there 's some Japanese beer paraphernalia about ..</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
