<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 593' %><h2>fried calamari<br />occurrence: 6</h2><div><ol><li>However the rolls were very satisfying and delicious as well as the calamari! ( best fried calamari we 've ever had) Service was very good, always attentive and made sure we had tea/water and never felt disrespected/rushed.</li><li>But my favourite is still the fried calamari!</li><li>We started off with an assortment of appetizers- the carpaccio, bruschetta, fried calamari, the rustic della casa platter, and the caprese salad.</li><li>Apps we had included the mango salad ( standard), chicken and beef satay skewers were some of the worst I 've had anywhere, and the fried calamari had too much breading and was overly oily ( thought my kids loved it).</li><li>Their fried calamari is always fresh and crispy which makes a lot of people come back to the store.</li><li>The fried calamari are very dark, perhaps for not changing the oil recently.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
