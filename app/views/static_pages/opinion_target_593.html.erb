<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 593' %><h2>taro<br />occurrence: 7</h2><div><ol><li>I had the 5 flavour sweet dumplings and i thought it was really good, it was consisted of chocolate, taro, sesame, mango and one more that i do n't recall anymore.</li><li>TIP- The taro is a solid favourite with me and my bro.</li><li>Both were great, with special kudos to the taro one because for once it was n't the fluorescent purple powdery kinds, and I can taste legit taro in the drink.</li><li>The taro was wrapped in a fried flaky pastry and the taro inside was soft and mushy.</li><li>The only complaint was there was hardly any crabs in the fried rice which is a bit of a rip, and the taro was obviously nuked then quickly pan fried ( it was a bit soggy when it should have been super crispy).</li><li>While they do use powered mix when you order versions such as honeydew or taro, everyone in the city seems to use powders for these flavour versions too.</li><li>Love the taro.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
