<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 316' %><h2>cream sauce<br />occurrence: 13</h2><div><ol><li>Then we had a fettuccine in cream sauce and with peas, also a chicken with tomato pasta.</li><li>I ordered the Pollo Pesto &amp; they have since eliminated the cream sauce from before.</li><li>Even when u ask for it, the cream sauce is all watered down.</li><li>The cream sauce was not too rich, and was complimented well with the squash.</li><li>It does n't take much to recognize that the cream sauce came out of a can, the chicken likely frozen bits but hey! the smoked salmon was generous slice.</li><li>Chicken breast, bacon, green onion and parmesan cheese served on spaghetti and tossed in a cream sauce.</li><li>Perhaps the seafood was from frozen, or the cream sauce did n't have any seafood juices in it.</li><li>The chicken crepe included cremini, spinach, swiss cheese, and a cream sauce.</li><li>The ravioli in the cream sauce was the most pleasing.</li><li>-Minestrone soup- housemade with love:) small size is $ 5 + tax- Daily pasta- today 's was fresh cheese-filled ravioli blanketed under a heavy rose-alfredo cream sauce.</li><li>Buddy got 1 pound of mussels, the cream sauce was excellent and the fresh mussels always taste better the frozen.</li><li>The Penne dish was an all around enjoyable dish that I would recommend to anyone craving a lightly flavored, heavier cream sauce with their pasta- it 's a safe bet.</li><li>Some memorable dishes for me:- the blanched SPINACH SALAD starter- super palate cleansing- SASHIMI NIGIRI- did n't check/could n't figure out what fish these were, but so buttery fresh. rice was very appropriately sized to the fish portion- SASHIMI LETTUCE ROLLS- seeing shredded lettuce wrapped within my sashimi felt weird to me, but it did help pick up some extra of the ponzu-type dressing so that it was adequately saucy- BAKED OYSTER- diced and baked with a cream sauce, topped with cheese and baked in the giant shell.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
