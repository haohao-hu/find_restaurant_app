<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 476' %><h2>beef balls<br />occurrence: 8</h2><div><ol><li>Rare beef was not rare, and the beef balls were cold, so I had to submerge it in the soup and save it for later to eat.</li><li>Anyways, I like ordering the dac biet because it has everything it it from tripe, to beef balls, to tendon etc.</li><li>That 's rare beef, tripe, tendons, beef balls plus the noodles and broth for $ 6.50.</li><li>My favourite is their Bun Cuon and pho with rare beef and beef balls.</li><li>Pho with rare beef and beef balls- Noodles was decent, but standard.</li><li>Moreover the beef balls were not well cooked, like they ( 1.5) were just taken out of the freezer five minutes ago.</li><li>For a large ( 6.50) you dont get much, maybe 5 pieces of beef and 3 beef balls.</li><li>Most recommended dish will be obviously their pho dac biet ( special famous beef noodle soup) with all the works including thinly sliced beef, beef balls, beef shank, beef tendon ( mmm my favourite!) and noodle with lots of bean sprouts and mint.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
