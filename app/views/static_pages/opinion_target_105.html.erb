some of those delicious dumplings, and thick yummy noodles, rice cakes ( tip: wait to eat them at the end so that they 've soaked up all that flavourful broth), mushrooms, veggies ...</li><li>The rice cakes and bean sprout soaked up the soup.</li><li>The toppings included rice cakes, red bean and cornflakes.</li><li>I 'm a sucker for the rice/grain powder and the rice cakes, so I quite enjoyed it.</li><li>The beef dumplings were flavorless and the rice cakes were undercooked.</li><li>I recommend you to order the top 3 add-ons for an additional $ 2.00 each; they are: rice cakes, cheddar, &amp; Ramen noodles.</li><li>My go to dishes are: 1) duk bo ki ( rice cakes)- not the best there is, but always good and fresh, and pretty spicy! 2) Kang poong gi ( fried chicken in a garlic sauce)- amazing. the portion is HUGE and so fresh and just the right amount of batter.</li><li>It was spicy just the way I like it and it comes with tons of vegetables and rice cakes too.</li><li>It was okay ( I forgot to add in the rice cakes!).</li><li>I added rice cakes, chicken, and cheese!</li><li>We added rice cakes, cheese, and ramen noodles.</li><li>I usually order the daegalbee with noodles, cheese, and rice cakes.</li><li>The cabbage was undercooked, so was the rice cakes.</li><li>Had the Spicy Chicken ( Dak Gal Bi) with noodles and sliced rice cakes.</li><li>The dish is predominantly Instant Noodles and rice cakes.</li><li>I always order JS1 with chicken, adding ramen, cheese and dubokki ( rice cakes).</li><li>The rice cakes, however, make you feel disgustingly full ( + the noodles) and midway through, I felt myself getting quite bloated and sick from it.</li><li>The best way to enjoy this dish: make sure you add on rice cakes, cheese and instant noodles.</li><li>The rice cakes are deliciously chewy, and the instant noodles help soak up all the extra sauce ( made the mistake of not getting noodles the first time, and it was just way too saucy and salty.)</li><li>We ordered the dak galbi with ramen, cheese and rice cakes.</li><li>Whenever I go I add the cheese, rice cakes and noodles.</li><li>Still a good staple place for dakgalbi, with cheese, ramen, and rice cakes being necessary add ons to make it an awesome meal.</li><li>We added noodles, cheese and rice cakes and it was yummy:) The spice is perfect, enough to clear your sinuses, but not sweat profusely from the heat: p The downside I can think of is that service is a bit slow and the add ons ( rice cakes, noodles, cheese, rice etc) are extra.</li><li>We added noodles, cheese and rice

cakes.</li><li>You also have to pay $ 2.00 for each add-on, with options such as: rice cakes, mozzarella cheese, and ramen noodles, which are all MUST HAVES in my opinion.</li><li>My friends and I usually order the Seafood DakGalbee with cheese, rice cakes and Joon 's special sauce.</li><li>There 's an extra cost for the cheese and rice cakes however, it 's all worth it !!</li><li>You can order a multitude of add-ons like ramen noodles, rice cakes, cheese, etc.</li><li>I 'm actually not the biggest fan of the rice cakes there as I find them a bit plain- the noodles with mozzarella cheese have much more chewiness to them as well as flavour.</li><li>We ordered it with cheese and ramen and rice cakes soooooo good.</li><li>The dakgalbi dishes now require you to place a minimum of 2 orders per dish, which can be quite pricey, considering the popular add ons- rice cakes, noodles and cheese, are an additional ~ $ 2 each.</li><li>I always get it with the regular level spicy ( + rice cakes, noodles and mozzarella cheese) I would recommend asking them to put less vegetables ( they always put a lot and less chicken).</li><li>The JS1 is just normal dak gal bee with chicken and vegetable where you can add on the rice cakes, cheese, noodles, sweet potato, vegetable, steamed rice and fried rice for $ 1- $ 2 each.</li><li>Extra add-ons include rice cakes, sweet potato, and mozzarella cheese ( a must get!).</li><li>I have tried the soon tofu, dolsot bibimbap, rice cakes and some other dishes as well but none were very impressive.</li><li>Ordered the Kalbi ( kbbq ribs) and Dukkboki ( spicy rice cakes).</li><li>The rice cakes were a perfect amount of spicyness but did n't have enough fish cake in it: ( Service was kind of slow, but I went for lunch on a weekend so it was busy.</li><li>( Not huge portions) I really like the spicy rice cakes here, they 're really flavorful and spicy!</li><li>Ordered 3 dishes being the dumpling and rice cake in egg drop soup which was really tasty but a little lacking in beef and too full of rice cakes.</li><li>I am usually a big fan of OWL and fancy going to their Mississauga and Bloor street location but this time around I was in the uptown area and decided to order some tofu soup and spicy rice cakes.</li><li>There 's rice cakes and other goodies floating around in the soup too.</li><li>The ramen came with a piece of dumpling and some rice cakes which make it a bit more interesting.</li><li>They beef ribs are meaty and yummy and rice cakes are a good deal.</li><li>It 's a simple mash of tubular rice cakes, fish cakes ( odeng), onions, gochujang ( red pepper sauce), and sugar.</li><li>- Fried Rice Cakes with Pork &amp; Pickled Vegetables ( $ 10.99): rice cakes are properly prepared, they are n't soggy or overly hard to chew.</li><li>We also got the rice cakes, they were okay.</li><li>S h a n g h a i- S t y l e R i c e C a k e s- I do n't like this dish as much as the beef brisket one, but nonetheless rice cakes are known to be chewy and I am a huge fan of chewy goodness.</li><li>This dish is a mixture of rice cakes, cabbage and small strips of pork.</li><li>There was maybe like 5 long rice cakes in the whole thing and like the rest of it was mushrooms and ONIONS! ( I 'm a huge hater of cooked onions, just find them too mushy to eat especially when they 've been sitting in gochujang sauce for a bit).</li><li>Soup was flavorful and spicy, though it was pretty much just a bunch of pork bones ( the ones with more bone than meat however), along with a few potatoes and rice cakes.</li><li>We did wait a long time for our dishes though, especially the pork and rice cakes.</li><li>I also got the spicy rice cakes.</li><li>My reason for such little stars was the upon asking for the bill I had requested a box for my rice cakes.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
