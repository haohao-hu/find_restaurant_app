<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 299' %><h2>mango<br />occurrence: 18</h2><div><ol><li>I had the 5 flavour sweet dumplings and i thought it was really good, it was consisted of chocolate, taro, sesame, mango and one more that i do n't recall anymore.</li><li>We ordered mango, garden, and seaweed salad to start.</li><li>To start the mango salad was n't thai at all ... hello is green mango not sweet! and where are the nuts and the onions ?? and the greens were all soggy and old ... then the soup it did not look like the picture in the menu and was super sweet ( i asked if it suppose to be that sweet, and she answer `` yes they put lots of sugar'') ... finally the noodles were swimming in sauce, in which i could not find the nuts and was super salty !!! ...</li><li>The mango was also pretty good, however the strawberry was better balance in the desert. and the waffle had a good presentation value. the only thing about the waffle is that its definitely not what they show you on the menu, on the menu they advertise the oreo waffle as a waffle infused with oreo and chocolate flavour, with vanilla ice cream on it.</li><li>We ordered one matcha Oreo and one mango, both are amazing.</li><li>I love everything mango, so this is my automatic go-to menu item.</li><li>The roll is made with mango, crab meat salad, and mint leaves topped with a spicy mango sauce.</li><li>Their other ice cream flavours are mango, red bean, and vanilla.</li><li>The curry itself is amazing and not too spicy and the beef is tender on the inside and has a light crispy outside. i ca n't get myself to try any of the other mains! for apps i 've tried their mango salad ( note that there 's coriander in it, which I hate and mint leaves which I also do n't like), beef satay ( not bad), and their fried calamari ( I would get this again and loved the honey chili dipping sauce it came with). desserts I 've tried their mango sticky rice ( the mango was not sweet and really hard) and their deep fried banana with honey ( just standard). the decor here is super cool and there 's a nice patio area for the summer, I love this place!</li><li>I thought the rice could be a bit sweeter, but it was balanced out by the mango- not bad! 2) Mango Roll with Ice Cream: DEELISHUS.</li><li>The mango salad was decent and mango was fresh and tasty.</li><li>The rice was hard and the mango was n't fresh.</li><li>Soup was great, the salad not as the mango was not fresh.</li><li>Nothing really stood out other than the multiple flavours of ice creams ( vanilla, green tea, red bean, mango, ginger).</li><li>We both got mango because we love tropical fruit.</li><li>Depending on what you order, they usually include some interesting ice cream at the end with mango, red bean and green tea as your choices.</li><li>I like their strawberry short cake and their mango.</li><li>They usually have mango, vanilla, chocolate and/or strawberry.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
