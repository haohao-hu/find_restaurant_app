<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 299' %><h2>flavours<br />occurrence: 14</h2><div><ol><li>The flavours are deep and natural and not a lot of salt which is the sign of an above-average restaurant.</li><li>More pricey/upscale in price point and ambience than your typical Korean joint, but the flavours are so potent and authentic!</li><li>The combination of flavours and textures that the chefs are able to produce are second to none.</li><li>However, if we were to eat it alone, the flavours were just too rich.</li><li>It was ok ... the flavours were nice but it just needed some oomph!</li><li>However the flavours were on point, rich like how real pho broth should taste.</li><li>The flavours taste natural, not overly sweet and I love that you can customize your sugar and ice levels.</li><li>This could be the smallest restaurant in Toronto but the flavours are gigantic.</li><li>While the flavours were authentic for the most part: the baba Ghanough was bland, the Falafels were dry and seemed re-heated and not fresh.</li><li>The flavours lace your mouth with a just the right amount of heat ( OK, after I put a little more chili on, then perfect!) and sour.</li><li>The only thing I did n't like was their flavoured coffee, which strikes no particular significance to me, the flavours are quite mild and sometimes hard to tell if you 're really drinking the flavour you ordered.</li><li>The `` green tea frosty flakes'' is an incredible dessert featuring various authentic flavours!</li><li>It was quite good, but I would definitely recommend adding mayo in that sisig for extra yumminess ( that 's how we make our pork sisig at home and trust me ... the flavours are bolder).</li><li>The flavours were right, and nothing was burnt/overcooked ( which happens sometimes at grill restaurants).</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
