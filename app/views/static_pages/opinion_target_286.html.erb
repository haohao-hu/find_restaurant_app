<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 286' %><h2>pepper<br />occurrence: 19</h2><div><ol><li>The toppings were also plentiful and excellently prepared- tasty tofu, chicken, shrimp, onion, pepper and peanut.</li><li>I had an egg salad sandwich that was chock full of pepper, cafe mochas that were only half filled, wrong soup, etc etc.</li><li>Beef Barley: it was a little bland, I 'd add Lil more salt &amp; pepper, coriander, Lil lemon and garlic.</li><li>There is a mustard &amp; ketchup station with push buttons slightly to the left of the Wendy 's ordering counter, but salt, pepper and plastic cutlery are no longer longer available at this station; you have to ask counter staff for those items, which is NOT IMO an improvement, given this is a very busy restaurant all the time, always line ups, as we who live in Weston have few dining options;_; ( For God 's sake, food franchises &amp; restaurant chains, take pity on Weston- Lawrence &amp; open up some businesses here!)</li><li>The sauce was entirely too spicy and tasted like someone had been a little too generous with the pepper.</li><li>Really wanted some more salt and pepper.</li><li>Spicy fish fillet noodle soup- my friend ordered this, again there is a chill pepper beside it on the menu but it is actually not that spicy.</li><li>Did n't expect it because the broth was white in colour but there was so much pepper put it, my friend did n't expect that it would be spicy judging from the description and looks in the menu.</li><li>So it was more like `` salted fried calamari'' rather than salt &amp; pepper.</li><li>The chef stands in front of you and give you a really good show with onion volcano and juggling with salt and pepper.</li><li>Spices like cumin, pepper, chili flakes, onion oil, all have their place here but the sugar was so pronounced I felt like I was eating candied rice pudding.</li><li>At another location the server asked us if we wanted parmesan cheese and chilli flakes, but this place only had chilli flakes on the tables with the salt and pepper.</li><li>They provided lettuce, other greens, sauce, pepper and garlic for us to wrap our meat in.</li><li>I choose my own amount of garlic, pepper, no salt, sesame seed oil, spring onion, parsley.</li><li>In fact, for a change, order dishes which have the identifier ' pepper' in the name.</li><li>This cuisine utilizes pepper in a way that is different, than westernized cuisine or cooking.</li><li>The waitress ended up charging her for the whole meal explaining that it was not their fault that she could not have pepper.</li><li>UPDATE: In a recent order, the biryani was made with LARGE chunks of bell pepper ( yes, bell pepper, orange bell pepper to be exact, which is really not what you 'd expect in a biryani) and massive pieces of onion too.</li><li>The meat is tender and moist ( apologies to those who hate this word) and it 's seasoned with red onions, coriander ( aka Cilantro), parsley ( aka Italian cilantro, just kidding) and from what I recall, paprika, pepper and cumin ...</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
