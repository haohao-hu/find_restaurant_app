<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 2136' %><h2>curried cauliflower dish<br />occurrence: 1</h2><div><ol><li>Every other day, for nearly 6 years, I walked by Cuisine of India and never really paid it much attention until people who lived no where nearby started recommending it. then i began to notice that lux cars were always parked there; it 's one of the only places around this subway travellers ' strip with a parking lot in front of the restaurant. and, as far as I can tell, it 's free to park. but certainly there 's more than the parking that caused these commuters from other parts of the city to rave about Cuisine of India. driving is one thing, but in this weather, i wondered,' is it worth walking ? ' so, i rallied my girlfriends living nearby to see just why commuters from other parts of the city were flocking. we got the impression that few local residents ever visited, since the host quizically looked at us ( the group of asian girls) when we entered and waited to be seated. after establishing that, indeed, we were there to eat, yes, food from Cuisine of India, the service was attentive, patient, and warm. the a la carte portions at Cuisine of India are small, and yet incredibly rich. so you can sample a few and be full, without getting a food baby. unfortunately, i do n't remember the names of the dishes we tried, but i recall that the curried cauliflower dish was very well-spiced, without being spicy. the naan are excellent, as are the spicy cracker-like flatbreads. the latter are served while you wait for your meal and the heat really does hit after a few nibbles, so pace yourself as you wait for your meal.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
