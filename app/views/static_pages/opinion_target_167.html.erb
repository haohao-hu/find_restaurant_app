<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 167' %><h2>entrees<br />occurrence: 30</h2><div><ol><li>The roasted potatoes, accompanying half the entrees, were firm and cold.</li><li>The entrees just glisten.</li><li>For one, the entrees are only okay.</li><li>I used a groupon for $ 20 worth of food- bought 2 entrees and still paid $ 12.</li><li>My friend and I order 3 entrees.</li><li>However, the entrees were both very delicious and we definitely enjoyed our main course the most.</li><li>My 10oz. prime rib was definitely at least 12oz. and most of their entrees are served with a mountain of fries ( or other sides you choose).</li><li>It has a wide selection of great food from the raw fish to the cooked entrees and everything in between.</li><li>The pricey Lebanese food ( we shared 4 entrees) was okay but there is better elsewhere, and the bland tabouleh was disappointing.</li><li>We ordered and we did n't get our entrees until 7pm.</li><li>That would have been nice since our entrees took such a long time!</li><li>The entrees were as good or better.</li><li>We started with Mieng Kum, Pla Meuk Tod ( Fried Calamari), and Tom Yum Goong soup, and our entrees were The Royal Pad Thai, Thai Islamic Noodles, and Seafood Fried Rice.</li><li>Lamb meat being lamb meat, all the entrees were moist and easy to chew.</li><li>The entrees are served with stale, chewy, garlic bread made from garlic powder and your choice of either salad, OR baked potato OR Uncle Ben 's rice.</li><li>So we wanted to try some appetizers and lobsters before we decided ordering more entrees.</li><li>When the waitress ( who seemed like the owner) took our orders of 4 appetizers and a 1 1/4 lobster, she was all like `` you 're in a group of 4, you need to order at least 2 entrees''.</li><li>This seems like a small detail to be complaining about, but when I go to a restaurant where appetizers average $ 15 and entrees at $ 32 I expect them to put some effort into what they serve with.</li><li>Oh of course if you are like me, here as a single diner ... you would have stuck with one of their entrees ...</li><li>They tend to cook at one table and bring the pan to you later ... not cool: (- if you 're getting the entrees which they cook in front of you, you have to order 2 of the same dish which generally leads to less choice/variety- they only accept debit or cash I actually did n't realize this until lately, but what they cook in front of you can be easily replicated at home.</li><li>While none of the entrees I 've had at The Pickle Barrel have ever blown me away, they 've all been A-Ok.</li><li>I was n't as impressed with the much more limited entrees ( a plate of chicken of different styles of cooking), but the pastries for dessert were good.</li><li>Our entrees were served shortly after.</li><li>However again for the price- over 80 bucks for 4 just ok entrees ?</li><li>I always get a side of either their shrimp salad rolls or spring rolls too, which go really well with the entrees.</li><li>The Entrees: Their entrees are great and the portions are huge.</li><li>It is unusual to see a `` cafe'' that serves such a wide variety of coffees, desserts and entrees.</li><li>No one wanted the cake since we were already full from the free appetizers and entrees.</li><li>Like Charlotte W. has pretty much summarized, there are new additions to the menu, but they have taken off the soup/salad that used to come with your entrees.</li><li>Every dish we ordered has a certain special `` oomph'' above the regular way these entrees are usually served.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
