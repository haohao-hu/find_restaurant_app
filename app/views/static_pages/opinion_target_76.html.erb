<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 76' %><h2>Pad Thai<br />occurrence: 84</h2><div><ol><li>Their Pad Thai was excellent.</li><li>We had the mango salad ( bland, have better), as well as the pad thai.</li><li>The pad thai was n't the greatest, you can definitely get better in Toronto.</li><li>The Pad Thai, har gow and sweet &amp; sour soups are my favs.</li><li>A pad thai to me will always be bad, so pad thai complaints I do n't think should be held against this restaurant.</li><li>And the pad thai is amazing.</li><li>I do not recommend the pad thai.</li><li>The pad thai is not the best I 've had, and the non-soup meals are decently simple, but not disappointing.</li><li>One was the pad thai which was good but heavy on the onions.</li><li>The only thing we ate and did not enjoy was the pad thai ... guess it is better to actually stick to the Japanese options!</li><li>Will not go there for the pho .. only for the pad Thai.</li><li>Best Pad Thai we 've both had in a long time.</li><li>You ordered pad thai, this is our pad thai.</li><li>You ordered pad thai, this is our pad thai.</li><li>In a small bit of redemption, they did n't charge us for the pad thai and we left quickly.</li><li>Good servers, standard food ( stay away from the pad thai though), but TERRIBLE management.</li><li>The pad thai is my least favourite dish here- even though it 's usually my favourite.</li><li>Basil eggplant was great, though the pad thai was oddly sweet and not very good.</li><li>I have only had their pad thai and they 're really really dang good.</li><li>The core dishes I always get ( pad thai and panang curry) are great, and my standards for these are high.</li><li>The pad thai was also delicious.</li><li>And when my friend asked if she could get the chicken in the pad thai changed to beef, I thought the soup nazi was going to finally make an appearance ... but he was perfectly accommodating.</li><li>Best pad Thai Ever !!!</li><li>When asked if they have saucy pad thai, he explained that the authentic dish is not meant to be saucy and should have a sweet tangy flavour.</li><li>We 've had pad thai, various curries, cold rolls, basil beef and all were well prepared and flavourful without the high sodium/ msg.</li><li>We had pad thai and pineapple fried rice- I 'm told it 's super authentic ( I 've never been to Thailand, so I ca n't say for sure ...)</li><li>I do recommend the pad thai or golden curry.</li><li>Ordered Mango Chicken and Pad Thai, both dishes were mouth watering.</li><li>You 'll like the pad thai if you do n't like the dish smothered in ketchup.</li><li>I add that sauce to the pad thai as well!</li><li>The pad Thai is off the chains.</li><li>I had the pad thai, mango salad and an assorted appetizer.</li><li>Their pad Thai and sticky rice with peanut sauce is consistently awesome, and the eggplant and green/red curry chicken/beef is awesome too.</li><li>I 'm not sure if I 'd ever order here again, maybe if I were having a craving for fast-foody pad thai.</li><li>The pad thai was interestingly served as what appeared as some square-shaped pastry.</li><li>Favorites were the bangkok stir fry and the pad thai.</li><li>The Royal Pad Thai was not your typical pad thai .. it was wrapped in what looked like a crÃªpe and all the stuffing was inside.</li><li>The pad Thai was actually wrapped in the egg which was cool.</li><li>Because the pad Thai was n't up to par, the sui mai is more of a Chinese dish ( with a Thai influence via the lemongrass), and the smoked duck with quinoa really did n't scream Thai either.</li><li>The pad Thai is pretty good, has the sweet and sour element pretty balanced, but flavour was n't as strong as I would 've liked.</li><li>When you 're trying out a new Thai place, you have to try their pad thai to determine whether or not it 's worth your next visit.</li><li>So go ahead and give it a try if you 're a pad thai fan.</li><li>Pad Thai- it was interesting as it was covered with a thin egg omlette all around w/ the islamic noodles inside. quite nice.</li><li>The Pad Thai was also good.</li><li>It was also a nice touch to have the Pad Thai come wrapped in a fried egg.</li><li>The Pad thai was a little small portioned for the cost, but the presentation was quite unique, as it was wrapped in a thin shell of egg, keeping the dish warm.</li><li>I really liked the presentation of the dish because the pad thai itself is inside an egg wrap.</li><li>Linda Modern Thai prides itself of its `` award-winning'' pad thai, but I just did n't think that the flavour justified a high price of $ 18.</li><li>My hubby decided on 15 for his pad thai and our friend got suckered into a 20.</li><li>Presentation was interesting but the Pad Thai was mediocre.</li><li>The Pad Thai tasted really nice, but both my mother and I felt really thirsty after the meal, like the way I feel after eating dim sum that has MSG.</li><li>The first time I had the staple pad Thai which had an unappealing sauce blend.</li><li>We had the seafood curry baked in a coconut and the Pad Thai.</li><li>The Pad Thai is covered with a layer of egg which looks pretty cool.</li><li>The flavor on the Pad Thai is much better than what I 've experienced at many other places.</li><li>Linda 's has the best Pad Thai I 've had that I can recall.</li><li>The pad thai was great but not too spicy.</li><li>I was looking forward to having their pad thai.</li><li>The egg wrap did not taste very good on top of the pad thai either.</li><li>If a Thai restaurant ca n't do the pad thai right, then I 'm not so sure about the rest.</li><li>The pad thai was the worse, overly sweet to the point that both my kids did n't want to eat it ( and they generally will eat any noodle dish!).</li><li>The pad Thai is nothing to rave bout either.</li><li>Great food at this place No matter what location you go to Turnips BBQ Pork Udon Shanghai Noodles Even the Thai food is decent Have had both the mango salad and the pad thai is quite yummy My parents have always ordered their Chinese food since it arrived We 'll definitely keep ordering from here Um .... I had the weirdest chinese dish; perhaps this place is a bit too traditional for me.</li><li>I had the Tiger Shrimp with Efu noodles and my wife had the Pad Thai.</li><li>Then came the Pad Thai.</li><li>The pad Thai came with a decent portion and was pretty authentic, with noodles that were textured just right.</li><li>I typically order: Thai Beef Steak, Pad Thai, Chili Garlic Chicken, and Chinese Broccoli in Oyster sauce for a group of three of us.</li><li>There is new management in place and They are very friendly and the service is really good. we got house platter, pad thai, curry chicken, cashew fried rice.</li><li>The Pad Thai was an awful soggy mess, the green currie was tasteless and the spicy fish we ordered was downright disgusting.</li><li>Our order was extremely uncomplicated: Pad Thai, Veggie Curry, Veg Spring Rolls, Mango Sticky Rice dessert.</li><li>2) The Pad Thai was terrible.</li><li>The pad Thai was too sweet and overcooked ( the noodles were clumped together, and were all broken apart.)</li><li>Fried rice was good, curry Iyam was ok, Red curry beef had chewy pieces of beef throughout but the most disappointing and worst tasting dish was the Pad Thai.</li><li>I 've had Pad Thai from this place on and off for over ten years but last nights had to be the worst ever.</li><li>My bf 's Pad thai was horrible.</li><li>We have been to many different Thai restaurants, and it was the worst Pad thai.</li><li>The kicker was when I tried to bring this up to the cashier to show her, she replied with something like `` we 're too busy sir, that is what the Pad Thai is like'' ( in other words tough luck, your order is like a slot machine, suck it up).</li><li>The pad thai is generally delicious but man have they upped their prices.</li><li>The pad thai is okay here and the glass noodle is another good item.</li><li>I ordered delivery- Pad Thai, Fried Tofu &amp; Coconut sticky rice.</li><li>The tofu seemed over cooked and the pad thai was starchy.</li><li>The food itself had really big portions, but the pad thai was horrendously sour.</li><li>They serve a great Pad Thai ..... but that is not Chinese.</li><li>I do n't know if I 've ever had `` real'' Pad Thai, my company told me it was n't.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
