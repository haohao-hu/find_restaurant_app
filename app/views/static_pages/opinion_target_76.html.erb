mactcha powder on the ends of the crepe.</li><li>The crepe itself was properly cooked, good chew and pretty thin.</li><li>My main pet peeve with the dish is that there was way too much whipped cream

the crepe.</li><li>I got the black sesame crepe and it was probably the best crepe I 've had in my life.</li><li>All were excellent and the ice-cream served with the crepe was really good.</li><li>But the crepe itself was perfect texture, not too egg-y, hint of sweetness, soft, slightly chewy with a thin layer of crispy from the pan.</li><li>I ordered tropical crepe and it was terrible basically it had no fruits at all and lots of creme.</li><li>3 stars for the crepe itself.</li><li>The crepe is very soft and tastes just like batter.</li><li>Each crepe was a work of art.</li><li>The contents of

good.</li><li>Cute little cafe, the crepe was so good.</li><li>The crepe was filled with a red bean paste, whip cream and pieces of sponge cake along with two scoops of green tea ice cream on the side.</li><li>The crepe was yummy, however, after a few bites ...</li><li>The savoury crepe was DELICIOUS!</li><li>$ 10 per crepe, I expect a larger portion or a classy dining atmospheres.</li><li>The

toppings are OK.</li><li>I really like the crepe here- it is not too crispy like some places I 've been to, not too sweet and great with ice cream.</li><li>The ice cream is not really anything special to be honest- it is the crepe that makes it great!</li><li>The banana really helped to balance the flavour and the chocolate ice cream mixed with bites of the crepe tasted scrumptious.</li><li>Everyone enjoyed what they got ( I ca n't recall all the items as most of us had the savoury crepe for lunch and followed it with shared sweet crepes as dessert).</li><li>The

strawberry ice cream but tasted abnormally sweet.</li><li>Hot chocolate was not sweet ( which some ppl enjoy, but not me) and the crepe was just so-so.</li><li>I had the sweet potato crepe that came with sweet potato ice cream but the sweet potato paste in the crepe was too overwhelming and strong which filled me up very quickly.</li><li>I had the Ham crepe, with an Americano, and both the crepe and coffee were delicious.</li><li>This was quite possibly the best crepe I 've ever had, and I wo n't hesitate to order this the next time I 'm here!</li><li>Frozen white chocolate- I found it to be on the sweeter side but this is most likely because I had the crepe paired with it.</li><li>The green tea crepe was mediocre, good crepe, good ice cream, red bean on par.</li><li>You get one crepe and one beverage from the select menu.</li><li>The crepe was quite delicious ... a lot of mushroom and chicken in a rich creamy white sauce.</li><li>Like everything was soft and squishy- the crepe, the mushrooms, etc.</li><li>The crepe was thin and well made.</li><li>However, the crepe was too tough to cut with the knife.</li><li>Im not sure if it was because the crepe was cold, or because the blade of the knife was dull.</li><li>The crepe itself was nice and crispy, at least the top half.</li><li>Unfortunately, a lot of the oil from the pan made its way to the plate so the bottom half of the crepe got kind of soggy.</li><li>If you prefer an even bigger dessert that is going to fill you up, you can take all of the ingredients of the crepe and put them on a waffle instead!</li><li>I always think I want a crepe or waffle, but I never quite get to it.</li><li>The smoked salmon rostti and crepe were still good but not as amazing as I remembered it to be.</li><li>We did n't even eat the crepe and just ate the icecream.</li><li>The crepe looked like DEAD SKIN.</li><li>The food itself tasted good and came in huge portion sizes ( a crepe could feed two).</li><li>The crepe with Nutella
