<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 131' %><h2>crust<br />occurrence: 43</h2><div><ol><li>Uneven crust thickness and little sauce ...</li><li>A pretty good pizza with a light, crispy crust.</li><li>They conceded that the crust was good, but their pizza was bland and the chicken was dry.</li><li>Their pizza is unique in a sense that the crust is thick and filled with toppings and sauce.</li><li>I like their pizza 's because they are thin crust, my favourite being the pizza salmone!</li><li>The crust was not thick and was easy to eat and fold.</li><li>Just 5 stars alone --- for its FIG pizza !! ~ my fave thin crust ( white bread and not multigrain, because it makes all the difference) with the toppings of sweet figs and arugula, prosciutto, and cheesy things = YuMMY yummy yummy !!</li><li>Here 's why I did n't give them 5 stars: The outside edge of the crust was burnt black but there were other parts near the middle that were soggy.</li><li>The crust was way too thick for my liking.</li><li>The crust and sauce of the pizza was good, thats why we went back for more.</li><li>My friend ordered a pizza that she created herself and the crust was just right-crispy and delicious.</li><li>Anyway, I had a little bit of the pizza- thin crust, stone baked.</li><li>My wife 's pizza was burnt by the the crust, which can be obviously seen her the server, while my pizza was n't burnt but was lacking toppings ( there were only one small/medium size shrimp on each slice of the 4 slice pizza, and there were small traces if scallops which I could hardly taste).</li><li>The crust is on the crispy side.</li><li>The chicken pie is especially delicious with a nice balance of crust, creme, chicken and veggies.</li><li>Over all, a nice place but if we come back, we 'll be sure to order something different next time! ok it 's no fluke the wood oven pizza here is very good. ( we ordered two kinds to try) the dough, sauce and cheese the base ingredients of most any pizza are top notch. the crust i would describe .. it 's not a thin where it 's paper thin and it 's not cooked crisp like I 've had at many other thin crust pizza places. having its so crisp hides the true identity of the pizza dough. how can one taste the crust if it 's burnt !? the crust is thin where one can bite into the dough know it 's dough and not thick enough to not overwhelm the toppings. my quattro stagione was made wrong though .. it suppose to be separate quarters of pizza with the individual toppings. but instead it was a pizza with all the toppings. c 'mon just because I do n't look italian does n't mean I do n't know how it 's suppose to be. do n't give me stupid excuses that things get roughed up in the oven that why that make it that way ? i do n't care for the chatty waitress here and the ridiculous excuses, but as i mentioned in my first review. i will come here for the food because the cooks and chefs in the back know what they are doing ..</li><li>Over all, a nice place but if we come back, we 'll be sure to order something different next time! ok it 's no fluke the wood oven pizza here is very good.
