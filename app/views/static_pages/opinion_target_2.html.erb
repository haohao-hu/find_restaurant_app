<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 2' %><h2>service<br />occurrence: 3972</h2><div><ol><li>First off, the service is AMAZING!</li><li>I will continue to come back here as the prices are very reasonable, the service is amazing, and the food is always delicious!</li><li>However, I am happy with the price, service and quality.</li><li>Now I have to say, the service is not the best, but the place is small so it 's easy to flag someone over if you need to.</li><li>I love the service, as it is so fast and good.</li><li>I came here for a late lunch and despite no one being around, the service was quick and efficient.</li><li>Ever since the place was sold this summer, the service and food quality have nose dived.</li><li>The food is of average quality but the prices are good and the service is fast.</li><li>Every other day, for nearly 6 years, I walked by Cuisine of India and never really paid it much attention until people who lived no where nearby started recommending it. then i began to notice that lux cars were always parked there; it 's one of the only places around this subway travellers ' strip with a parking lot in front of the restaurant. and, as far as I can tell, it 's free to park. but certainly there 's more than the parking that caused these commuters from other parts of the city to rave about Cuisine of India. driving is one thing, but in this weather, i wondered,' is it worth walking ? ' so, i rallied my girlfriends living nearby to see just why commuters from other parts of the city were flocking. we got the impression that few local residents ever visited, since the host quizically looked at us ( the group of asian girls) when we entered and waited to be seated. after establishing that, indeed, we were there to eat, yes, food from Cuisine of India, the service was attentive, patient, and warm. the a la carte portions at Cuisine of India are small, and yet incredibly rich. so you can sample a few and be full, without getting a food baby. unfortunately, i do n't remember the names of the dishes we tried, but i recall that the curried cauliflower dish was very well-spiced, without being spicy. the naan are excellent, as are the spicy cracker-like flatbreads. the latter are served while you wait for your meal and the heat really does hit after a few nibbles, so pace yourself as you wait for your meal.</li><li>The letter says: `` RE: Your Service Experience Further to our discussion, thank you for contacting Pizza Pizza.</li><li>Yours truly, Pizza Pizza Limited Customer Service `` So fine, i receive this letter.</li><li>Plus unfriendly service ...</li><li>Service was decent, though a bit distracted and we were able to find a seat to enjoy our coffees.</li><li>These people have absolutely NO customer service!</li><li>Other than that service was fast &amp; cheerful.</li><li>Service was very good.</li><li>This place can fill up fast at lunch but since the service is usually quick, we 're typically in and out within the hour.</li><li>What it lacks in size makes up in the overall service and food quality.</li><li>The service was fast but I would n't save the waiter was especially friendly, did n't say much, but he took our order and served the food quickly.</li><li>Food and service was great and ca n't complain about the increase in prices over the years due to the consistency of quality and service.</li><li>Food and service was great and ca n't complain about the increase in prices over the years due to the consistency of quality and service.</li><li>Service was pretty good, prices a little high, and food quality was pretty decent.</li><li>Service is always very slow.</li><li>Great service, great price, fantastic food, fava beans were incredible and chicken is moist and delicious.</li><li>Service was friendly and very quick.</li><li>The service is lightening fast.</li><li>The service was good.</li><li>There 's a little bit of outdoor seating which is nice in the summer, and the service was top notch both times I 've been there.</li><li>My experiences always reflected the previous reviews below, poor service and average food.</li><li>It is a small, fast food Asian style eatery that is free of potentious decor or service but is pretty good at what it does.</li><li>The service was exceptional, however the food ... was questionable.</li><li>Service was slow, but friendly.</li><li>Service is ok, but considering we 're the only patrons, I 'd expect a little more. just to let you know we drive all the way from Brampton, just to go to this place whicj is in scarborough. the middle eastern food is awesome, the portions are a good size and the prices are dirt cheap, small swarma dinner for under $ 8 per person, falafels are good and there hot wings are soooooo hot for $ 5o bucks four people will be stuffed as they give you free appetizers, hot peppers, beets, olives and pitas.</li><li>Not so great .... service ....</li><li>Service is excellent.</li><li>its cheap with friendly service but they made my sushi with regular plain rice instead of sushi rice ( vinegar + sugar) so it tastes weird. later they found out but i disnt bother to tell them bc i was planning to never come back. instead of an apology i got a on the house almon handroll.</li><li>The service is pretty good as well and the staff are very friendly.</li><li>Very fresh fish and a top sepler to me was that there was a little service button at each table so no hovering servers over serving you or forgetting that you 're there.</li><li>3 stars for customer service.</li><li>I can not make too many comments on the service since we were served by at least 3-4 different people through the night.</li><li>The only thing that I can really complain about is the lack of service.</li><li>Also noted that on the wall beside each table there is actually a button to call more service, I did not figure this out till another customer told me.</li><li>Service wasnt the best but it is a pass on my books.</li><li>Service is prompt and they always bring you appetizers for groups of 2 or larger.</li><li>Service is good and food is fresh and delicious.</li><li>The service is pretty good, they get busy during working day lunches and sometimes wait times suffer, but I 've been there enough to know to arrive at 11:30am or after 1pm just to be safe.</li><li>Summary: great prices, amazing friendly service, nothing fancy but it is the best pizza option in North York for its price range at the moment.</li><li>Go figure, I 've been to better quality and service eateries that cost less, but I digress. the server then rudely snatches the takeout menu from my hand and stacks it back with the rest.</li><li>Tainted by my displeasure at the poor service, did n't make it any better.</li><li>Service was quick and correct.</li><li>Great food, awesome service and at a reasonably cheap price where can you go wrong ?</li><li>The service is quick and friendly.</li><li>Great service and I 've never had an order go wrong even though there may be a language barrier.</li><li>I have been to this restaurant more than 30 times and they always serve good korean food with great service.</li><li>Service was good, and the place is very casual.</li><li>Service is friendly as well:).</li><li>Service is as good as it can be although there was a bit of a language barrier.</li><li>The menu is n't all that great, the service was unfriendly and the bacon cheeseburger I had was `` just okay''.</li><li>Large portions, good food, and friendly service!</li><li>Overall quick service, and cheap tasty diner food make the Friendly House one of the best late night options uptown.</li><li>The Friendly House is a 24/7 diner that offered good service in a quiet environment.</li><li>The service here is great and fast.</li><li>The service is fast, which is again impressive considering they make all the fancy drink orders for the Congee Wong just a few doors down as well.</li><li>We 've been here many times before and food + service was ok, this must have been a one off bad experience.</li><li>My friend and I ordered- steamed xo sauce pork neck rice: a little bland, and came with a bowl of cooked lettuce in soy sauce ...- stinky hot pot: really good, with intestines, pigs blood, enokie mushrooms, fish balls, and fish cake- mixed vegetables and tofu dry pot: it was okay- herbal essence jelly in coconut milk: awesome- mango freeze: she said it was awesome The decor is nice, the service is unfriendly.</li><li>I can understand why the service is lacking on a weekday lunch hour since there is only 1 waitress who taking orders, making drinks and desserts and delivering the orders from kitchen.</li><li>My only complaint is the service.</li><li>The service was great and prompt, we did n't have to wait long to be seated and served.</li><li>I find the service could be inproved a little, and the attitude of the servers. and some cushions on the benches please !!!</li><li>Weekends are busy, but in spite of that, service was awesome.</li><li>The service, however, was very good.</li><li>Our water glasses and coffee mugs were also refilled frequently so the service was very attentive.</li><li>The company, enhanced by good service and a comfortable environment helped us to enjoy a pleasant and relaxed break with our friends.</li><li>The service was ok, not the best, but also not the worst.</li><li>Overall service and cleanliness is EXCELLENT.</li><li>Surely way cleaner, better chairs, better service, and better WiFi.</li><li>Nice coffee and service with a cozy atmosphere.</li><li>The only reason why I didnt give this particular location a full score is because the service and consistency.</li><li>The service is mediocre and the quality of my coffees are not consistent.</li><li>Decent service and ample sitting room.</li><li>The service in my experience has always been good, the staff is pleasant and very on top of orders.</li><li>Friendly and prompt service, the best pizza I 've ever had in Toronto, and overall just amazing.</li><li>Good pizza but the service is absolutely terrible.</li><li>Service was quick and friendly.</li><li>The food is not so bad here, but the service is just horrible.</li><li>- Yeah, service does suck, but I 'm not here for that.</li><li>Where I have a problem is the service.</li><li>I agree with the other reviews on how much their customer service sucks.</li><li>The service is okay.</li><li>There is no particular `` service'' at a pickup counter but as far as that goes, the staff at Baharan are very accommodating and amicable!</li><li>Service was great, location convenient, its small trendy &amp; casual and a great little lunch spot.</li><li>Great food and very quick service as well.</li><li>The service was slow, despite only a few other tables of patrons.</li><li>Service was good and the meal came out fast.</li><li>Attentive service Tasty dishes: Green chicken Thai curry, Red tofu Thai curry Mango salad big &amp; tasty.</li><li>Service was very prompt but the pressure to move on was clear once the place filled up.</li><li>For $ 10 you can have a nice veg option lunch. the staff is super attentive and remembers the clients. more than one time we were recognized and welcomed as special guests. the service is pretty quick so we never had to stay there longer than our allocated 1hr lunch. another point is that they 're good at accommodating larger groups ( we went as a group of 8 + people for lunch few times and never had any issues).</li><li>But now, there 's as many Mandarin speakers as there are the two combined, especially in the service industry.</li><li>Idk why people giving this place higher stars since the food is blend and the service is extremely bad.</li><li>It 's just the service is really poor.</li><li>Location: 4916 Yonge Street North York, ON M2N Price: $ $ Service: Friendly The food was not good.</li><li>Busy, but service was quick and error-free.</li><li>Sometimes, however, I do need my Timmies fix, and the service is very fast, staff people friendly.</li><li>The service was quick, although I have had much better sushi elsewhere, I 'm not sure if i would come and eat here again if I was in this neighborhood.</li><li>Service was fairly good but when we were almost finish eating, all the employees were also eating their lunch and it took some time to get the bill.</li><li>But overall, food was pretty good not amazing and service was average.</li><li>Went there for a Saturday Lunch, service was really slow as the restaurant was packed and they only had 2 waitress.</li><li>People could n't place orders or pay their bills, naturally food service is delayed too.</li><li>There was 6 tables that waited 10 mintues to pay, finally the guy beside me couldnt take it anymore and walks to the cashier to pay; soon as this happens 6 other people do the same, and there was effectively no food delivery or other service until they were done 10 minutes later.</li><li>The service is okay.</li><li>Friendly service with a smile, fresh coffee ( on my dark roast black), display full of selections of food.</li><li>The service was fine.</li><li>Service was TERRIBLE.</li><li>The service was absolute garbage.</li><li>The way I do it is I start with whatever I expect 25% of my bill to be ( thats generous) and then every time something happens where the service appeared to be lacking I take off 25 cents.</li><li>She should have been paying me for bearing such terrible service!</li><li>Although service was excellent and food seemed very health conscious.</li><li>Excellent food, good friendly service and cozy atmosphere.</li><li>The service is friendly.</li><li>It pains me to write this as the service and the people there were so nice to us, but I hope they improve/change to get more people through the door.</li><li>The service was slow and the wifi did not work.</li><li>The place is definitely very dated and run-down, with very minimal service, but the food is actually quite good and the price is even better.</li><li>Good parking, good service.</li><li>The service was quick and polite.</li><li>A lot more fresh and the service is warmer and friendlier.</li><li>I hate their uniforms ( the servers look like their ready to go to bed in their pyjamas), but the service provided by the servers is quick.</li><li>The service has always been great and the fish is so fresh.</li><li>But service was very slow.</li><li>Meal was very good, but very disappointed by the slow service.</li><li>Service is fast and attentive but the food is not special and very overpriced.</li><li>Dessert- mango icecream- only thing decent here as they had tempura bits in it which was interesting There are so many better sushi places not too far from here with much better prices and service.</li><li>The service was very friendly (!) and quick.</li><li>They have great sauces and the service is quick and friendly.</li><li>The service was great- I would go again, but like others have said, I would get takeout.</li><li>The service is non existent and the experience is usually the same ( displeasing).</li><li>Why should I not expect stellar service ?</li><li>I complained one time but all I got was a phone call apologizing for the poor service and them telling me they 'll work on it.</li><li>But nonetheless it 's always been a go-to place as it 's close by and we 've always found the service pretty decent.</li><li>Really busy spot but service was slow.</li><li>I was greeted by the cute waitress ( I should mention, this place had always had very attractive service girls) who spend a whole ten seconds contemplating where to sit us in her completely empty restaurant.</li><li>If you 're not korean, I believe they will service you slower.</li><li>One of the best parts about eating here is the service.</li><li>The staff were super friendly, and the service, though the food prep was a bit slow, was prompt and accommodating.</li><li>Service is a bit slow but the quality makes up for it.</li><li>Brilliant food, service and newly renovated look is much better now.</li><li>The decor is very nice and the service is awesome.</li><li>I could have had the same dish at the more elegant Zaffron ( http://www.yelp.ca/biz/zaffron-restaurant-north-york) for practically the same price. nice atmosphere. decent food. good service.</li><li>Starbucks is supposed to be known for its great customer service ...</li><li>I do n't think the baristas here have ever heard the term `` customer service'' before.</li><li>Bottom line: try another location for faster service.</li><li>The service was fast and the server were quick on moving the line.</li><li>Service here was just terrible.</li><li>The service was prompt but they need to correct their portion sizes.</li><li>Service was pretty good.</li><li>Honestly I have been here a few times with my boyfriend and absolutely loved the food- the service on the other hand is horrible- I 'll went with my brother who is handicapped and my father, we were seated and not a single waitress came to even bring us water or ask if we needed help or to place an order ...</li><li>Will not return. came here with one of the daily deal coupons ( wagjag and groupon) .. totally not worth it ... service was a fail.</li><li>The decor, atmosphere and service was very good.</li><li>Service is pretty fast.</li><li>Was n't overly impressed with the dishes and flavour/freshness of the fish, but service was good and all the dishes came out well.</li><li>Service is great but food is nothing special.</li><li>Great service, get the dinner buffet menu, soooo worth it !!</li><li>Service was decent and they mostly respond in English and sometimes Cantonese.</li><li>I stood at the front door for awhile waiting to be seated, and finally someone came by and brought us to a booth. ( Most booth were filled with people) Service-waitress 5/5 Very good service and attentive.</li><li>They accept credit card payments and service charge is not added on the bill.</li><li>The one star is for service and the other is for the grill station.</li><li>No service ， tried to order beton box and switch to another roll got rejected even though I said I can pay extra.</li><li>PROS + Ambience + Service + Location: A + for convenience.</li><li>Timely service.</li><li>I can overlook poor English, poor food and an unreasonable bill, but not this rude, inexcusable behaviour and poor customer service.</li><li>Myself and my colleague are not the belligerent typology of bar frequenting clientele- on the contrary, we are highly respectful individuals, well educated, and we tend to tip fairly well in relation to the service and treatment gained through each experience associated with a casual night out.</li><li>They have no understanding of customer service.</li><li>It was a very busy night with only 3 waitresses so service was hard to get.</li><li>Did n't really like the snooty/lazy service already ... ' bartendress' behaving as if I 'm some sort of dumb-a $ $ for not knowing all the brands of domestic beer ... maybe i am but I would n't expect a tip if you feel so inclined to talk down to me!</li><li>The service was fine and our waitress was friendly.</li><li>Went here with a group of 14 people on a last minute decision for a late birthday dinner/drinks and service was decent.</li><li>Service is also friendly so will become a regular customer for as long as I still live in this area.</li><li>The Korean restaurant next door offers much better service.</li><li>Service is usually great too!</li><li>The WORST service ever!</li><li>Still A-ok place to go to at 2 in the morning with no other options i must say, but do n't expect to b blown away by the service or the food.</li><li>Worst service ever.</li><li>The food at this place is very good everything on the menu is worth trying and prices are fair as well, how ever the service sucks!</li><li>Service is a tad slow but not unbearable.</li><li>The service was nothing special here, my friend got a knife that was not cleaned properly.</li><li>This review is only for this location since I have been to many of them all over Toronto and the service has been excellent and the food good.</li><li>I will not go in great details but in summary: the service was poor and rude but the food is good.</li><li>Do not use this review to assess other locations since I have been to over a dozen different locations and food and service have consistently been good!</li><li>Service: not particularly enthusiastic.</li><li>Service was fine until we found a razor blade in our fries.</li><li>Not for service or for ambience but mostly for the largest selection of Jamaican products in the area.</li><li>I came pretty early around 11:30AM and was seated immediately- the service here is top-notch and you could tell they emphasized exceptional customer service as they continuously ask for refills of water and helped me out with their menus.</li><li>I came pretty early around 11:30AM and was seated immediately- the service here is top-notch and you could tell they emphasized exceptional customer service as they continuously ask for refills of water and helped me out with their menus.</li><li>Sonia 's accommodating demeanor, friendly but professional manners, and timeliness of service, really made an impression on me.</li><li>Service: Great.</li><li>Excellent food, service and atmosphere.</li><li>The service was unbelievable!</li><li>Service is great, fish is fresh, drinks are cold, booths are intimate.</li><li>Service was excellent.</li><li>I feel it 's a little overpriced compared to other sushi places but you do get superior service.</li><li>The fish was absolutely perfect -- it tasted like it may have been swimming several hours back:) The service was excellent- the server volunteered to change the existing roll components to what he inferred we would like- which is unusual to say the least.</li><li>The service was decent.</li><li>Great service, atmosphere, and more importantly, delicious food.</li><li>The host Joe is a good guy and service is good.</li><li>Prompt service.</li><li>We have been to this place three times and only once the service was on the slow side.</li><li>Service was great, and food was just as good.</li><li>Service is OK.</li><li>Fresh, ok service, nice atmosphere, BUT overpriced !!</li><li>Service is excellent!</li><li>Was first introduced to Sushi Moto a couple of years back and am impressed by the quality of the food, excellent service and beautiful decor.</li><li>Pricing is a little higher than the area competition but the above mentioned quality of food, service and decor, justify the higher prices.</li><li>8.5/10 for quality, 8.5/10 for the service, 9/10 for the value.</li><li>Service was great but I can imagine how parking could be an issue since it 's right on busy Yonge St. The ambiance is very Chic if you 're into that.</li><li>Food**** Service**** 1/2 Ambiance****.</li><li>Service was pretty much nonexistent.</li><li>Fantastic customer service, as well as delicious fresh sushi!</li><li>The food has always been good, the presentation on point, and the decor and service has always been good.</li><li>Overall I would give this place a 4 star because I have eaten here many times and love the food, service and atmosphere.</li><li>I will definitely come back! this place is soo expensive. the dinner bento box is almost $ 20. the service is good and the food is great but the prices just arent worth it, at all. there are so many places in this area that are much more reasonable with the same quality food. the ambiance is really nice, which is probably why the prices are so high ... i probably wouldnt visit again. i 'd recommend for people with money to spare lol.</li><li>Service was fast and place was upscale and very comfy booths.</li><li>Service was great- they were very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed even though it was busy.</li><li>If we visit Toronto again, we would n't mind coming here gain for the awesome food and service!</li><li>Service was prompt.</li><li>The service was friendly and earnest.</li><li>The ambiance is cool, and service is good.</li><li>With each spontaneous visit, the food is always delicious, the staff are superb ( service and attentiveness) and overall I love the vibe here.</li><li>If you come here, you 'll receive IMPECCABLE service not only from the servers but the management as well.</li><li>Great ambience, Great service, Great food.</li><li>First impression- Service was beyond attentive and warm.</li><li>+ .5 for service For a 4 star restaurant, I expected more from this place.</li><li>Service was great, which seems to fall in line with the other reviews.</li><li>The service is also usually pretty good, unless it 's one of those really busy Friday lunch hours.</li><li>An absolute stellar experience in service and attention for detail.</li><li>On my latest visit I had a great customer service experience.</li><li>The only negative point is that I have noticed the service is quick at first, then nowhere to be found after you 've received your food.</li><li>The service is great, and they do a great job of greeting you upon entering and exiting the restaurant.</li><li>Service is quick and efficient.</li><li>In the dictionary under customer service should be this managers picture.</li><li>I went here for a company luch and I can say the food was pretty good and the service was actually very good.</li><li>Visited Sushi Moto with a friend, and was quite impressed: good quality sushi and solid service.</li><li>Special Maki Rolls that are must

service.</li><li>Definitely recommend trying out! this is a great place to have good quality fresh sushi The best thing I like about this restaurant is the service is quick the location is good and the hours of operation are long the restaurant typically opens until 2 o' clock in the morning on the weekends and at least till midnight during the weekdays The one thing that impressed me the most about this restaurant is that management is very hands on they will always make sure that you are greeted right away and they always say thank you for your business at the end.</li><li>Probably will not be back here again. nice service good sushi ...</li><li>Every time I come to Moto sushi I always get great service, fish is fresh and atmosphere is really cool.</li><li>All of the staff are `` white washed'' with great service.</li><li>Excellent service and the staff are terrific make you feel like your in their home.</li><li>I expressed my deep gratitude for their service and consistent great tasting food each and every time.</li><li>THANK YOU SUSHI MOTO for your consistent outstanding excellent tasting food &amp; service!</li><li>To sum it all up: Sushi Moto is a large, busy sushi joint ( run by Koreans) serving up pretty good food at reasonable prices in a modern, contemporary setting with pretty good service to boot.</li><li>I found the service just OK.</li><li>I am very impressed with the service as well as the food.</li><li>Service.</li><li>Service was quite good though!</li><li>The service was so-so, the food took too long but the decor is nice I

tried.</li><li>This place is very nice and the service is very friendly.</li><li>The service was excellent, the food was fresh and terrific and the ambiance/decor is chic!</li><li>Quality, service, atmosphere of this place all get 4/5s.</li><li>The reviews for here were fairly glowing but I thought this was a pretty mediocre restaurant, both in the sushi and the service.</li><li>Sushi moto is our go to sushi place The sushi is always fresh, service is always quick We come here once every week or 2 and are always happy with everything I love their maki- lots of creative options- my personal faves are the fire roll, Cali roll, tiger 's tail and dynamite Their tempura is fresh and not too breaded My husband really likes the chirashi- the fish is very fresh and the selection is good too We regularly also get the maki combo 1 for dinner- it 's a great deal and it 's enough for 2 people I also love their complimentary soup.</li><li>WONTON SOUP Too salty: ( Service was good but the food was n't that special ( I think I 'll stick with just the uni/ the toro sushi next time hehe).</li><li>The service here is fantastic!</li><li>Service was decent, considering we had a group of 30 people.</li><li>Service was very nice, prompt, and attentive.</li><li>4/5 service is also quite good, except the weird man at the door is some times rude ..</li><li>I 've always received great service as well.</li><li>Good service ( only thing is some of the girls do n't speak English that well).</li><li>The service is not consistently great .. every once in a while you get a waiter whose too busy for you ..</li><li>One of the best places for dates, affordable prices and good service.</li><li>The atmosphere and service are both great.</li><li>Service was also a bit slower than expected.</li><li>We were both stuffed by the end of the meal, but already thinking about who we were going to bring on our next visit to try more items on their menu ~ Prices are more than the average sushi place, but for service, atmosphere and quality of food I would say you definitely get what you pay for ~.</li><li>The service was on point and we had a very enjoyable meal.</li><li>Service is more than on point, tempura is food to go, and sushi great.</li><li>I mean I 've had good service in other restaurants, but she seemed to really enjoy what she was doing and so her service to us was really exceptional.</li><li>I mean I 've had good service in other restaurants, but she seemed to really enjoy what she was doing and so her service to us was really exceptional.</li><li>My 5 stars definitely went toward the service, but I would definitely come back to try the sushi!</li><li>I like the atmosphere with its slick Asian sports bar vibe, the friendly professional and downright good-looking service, and most of all the food.</li><li>A testament to good food and good service with the right attitude makes for a successful business.</li><li>Young attractive servers and seasoned veterans service the hip and happening crew right up the the biz peeps and family diners.</li><li>I 'd wish green tea would be hotter and there would n't be a TV screen visible from no matter where you sit, but other than that, the service so far has been fast and attentive, no plastic plates or cups, the fish is very fresh, rolls are of good size and nicely presented.</li><li>Service was polite and friendly without being overwhelming.</li><li>The food, decor and service are all top notch.</li><li>The food, service, and ambience is great.</li><li>The

actually kind of unbelievable.</li><li>The service was excellent.</li><li>I usually do n't think too much about service, but it was bad enough this time for me to mention.</li><li>I usually find complaints towards general service inadequacies to be petty attempts at a more sophisticated restaurant review, but it literally took me more than 4 requests to two different servers including my own to have my water filled just once, and the overabundance of sodium in the dishes did n't help much either.</li><li>Service was nice as they got drinks to us quickly and ensured we were always topped

priced and fast service, hence their name `` express''.</li><li>Overall, customer service and food is good.</li><li>The service is okay, but most people who go there speak primarily Hungarian and same goes for the people who work there.</li><li>The service was fine.</li><li>I givez 1 star for the service, the guys here are sorta nice and sweet in their own way.</li><li>Service was a bit on the slow side but the wings more than made up for it.</li><li>Waitresses double as hostesses and bartenders so service is lacking but they make up for it in personality ( they love chatting up their customers) and knowledge of the menu.</li><li>More importantly, the service is really good from Kayley and Addy!</li><li>Well done and keep up the great service!</li><li>Service was n't that great compare to

sandwich with a side salad ( on the paltry side) but everything seemed fresh and service was acceptable.</li><li>Service is solid.</li><li>Their service was prompt, food was fresh- including the noodles, which is pretty hard to come by these days when you compare the price units on OrientK 's menu in the delivery side of the restaurant business in its neighbourhood.</li><li>However, the service was quick and friendly and the food was good.</li><li>Service has been friendly each time I 've been here.</li><li>Service is excellent without being intrusive.</li><li>Service is stellar.</li><li>Great service and food.</li><li>At the end of the day, despite the food being good, it 's not WOW, but rather, you come here for that warm service.</li><li>The fries were excellent and the service was great.</li><li>Great service from the wait staff and the owner took time to come sit with us for a few minutes as we finished our meal.</li><li>Service could be better but most of

clean and have friendly service.</li><li>A lot of choices for bibimbap &amp; ginseng chicken soup ( with a small bowl of noodle) The pork cutlet on rice is surprisingly good, highly recommended The

a variety of items on their menu.</li><li>Service was prompt and they were really nice.</li><li>It is hard to find and pretty dark inside but the service is great and the food is spectacular.</li><li>Service is great and food even better!</li><li>Came here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon- there were only two servers working and service was a little slow but they were very nice

quick.</li><li>Great service, friendly staff and good food.</li><li>Service: I found most of the servers were here on a working visa ( overheard from an over friendly customer who was chatting with them).</li><li>Still the service was good and so were the little side dishes.</li><li>Service was great, waitress was very attentive and friendly.</li><li>We were very satisfied with the food and the service.</li><li>Clean and good service.</li><li>Service is always friendly.</li><li>Overall I found everything quite pleasant- service was fast, polite and friendly, the restaurant is not huge ( 12 tables ?) but clean, the food came at good temperature and quite tasty.</li><li>I have been here a few times, but recently their service has deteriorated from good to terrible.</li><li>Service was great too!</li><li>Fastest service ever!</li><li>Asians are not business savy in the customer service department.</li><li>Also the service was superb!</li><li>Food comes super fast even when they are at capacity and service is good.</li><li>Friendly and fast service.</li><li>Fast service and friendly.</li><li>The service here is second to none.</li><li>I found the service to be pretty rude.</li><li>Not unless you do n't mind how your waiter treats you and only come for fast service and good food.</li><li>The service was always attentive without being overly effusive.</li><li>I usually order delivery, but every time I 've dined in, the service has been stellar.</li><li>Delicious food and fast service it never disappoints.</li><li>Service was great very attentive staff.</li><li>Fast delivery service.</li><li>Without a doubt the rudest, most unfriendly service I have ever experienced!</li><li>Great service though and friendly staff.</li><li>This is how you handle service ?</li><li>Extremely bias on the rating because of horrendous service and lack of respect.</li><li>There are no customer service at all.</li><li>The SERVICE is sometimes so good it seems uncharacteristic for a hakka style venue.</li><li>Nowhere have I experienced better service from not just our waiter but each and every member of the staff.</li><li>Fast and friendly service every time we 've been.</li><li>Service was impeccable.</li><li>But the food is absolutely wonderful. we are regular customer, s at this restaurant, Tonight we ordered the usual, our favourte dish is peanut chicken, we brought our three dish, s home and upon opening the chicken we saw half the dish was peanut sauce and less than half the usual amount of chicken, I called the restaurant and spoke to the owner for ten minutes, she insisted that it was made the same as always, It was not at all, we paid 11,95 for peanut sauce and a small amount of chicken,, The arrogant owner could not care less, refusing to credit us for next time we picked up, or d delivering a new dish to our home, This place the staff is unfriendly, not well mannered, and horrible customer service, and the food was awful, except for the fried rice, it was good, If your looking for bad service this is the place to go, the customer is never right,, be warned,.</li><li>Restaurant: Jung Soo Nae Cuisine: Korean Location:

I eat there often and they are always offer fresh food and great service.</li><li>Service is very disorganized.</li><li>The service is unreliable and disorganized and the food is barely acceptable.</li><li>I 've never experienced a long wait ( as Dan G. points out in his review) but I do agree the service is n't extraordinary.</li><li>I found the service to be very good and the counter-based ordering system seemed to make sense.</li><li>Still the worst service.</li><li>Good food and service though the line is ridiculous.</li><li>Surprisingly enough, seating was very quick

all fat.</li><li>Anyway, the service here sucks.</li><li>The service is generally slow.</li><li>Service was okay working zone but had a lot at the beginning and pretty much nothing at the end.</li><li>Overall would come back but sitting closer to the kitchen probably gets better service.</li><li>- I love Cora 's and this was a good location- great service, yummy food.</li><li>Good food and good service.</li><li>The omelets were very good, just like the service.</li><li>Maybe we caught this location on a bad day but the service was really terrible.</li><li>The food is GREAT but the

restaurant with quick and efficient service.</li><li>In terms of service I totally agree with the other reviews, there was no organization.</li><li>First of, the service.</li><li>The service was very friendly and the place was very `` bright'' and clean.</li><li>Overall wonderful food, portion size, and service for the price.</li><li>Service was a slow on this day.</li><li>This location 's service is a bit slow but the food is always great.</li><li>Food OK but expect inattentive service and dour attitudes, sticky tables and dirty cutlery, lineup even though a dozen empty tables inside.</li><li>This location is great, service and food were spot on!</li><li>Paying over $ 30 for 2 veggie omelettes not including coffee seems a little too much for their quality of food and service.</li><li>Firstly, if I were to review just the service of this place, I would give it 5 stars, as we were 10 people today and our server handled us amazingly.</li><li>The service was great though.</li><li>Service was quick and friendly.</li><li>You may not mind `` some extra protein'' at such good prices and quick service but I wo n't go back.</li><li>Horrible service- the guy who works at the yonge and empress location definitely is partial to female customers.</li><li>Quick service and hearty serving sizes makes this a reliable option time and time again.</li><li>The service and quality of food is extremely disappointing as chicken was their only option since they burned their beef.</li><li>Great quick service.</li><li>The service is super quick which is really important for impatient drunks on a Saturday night.</li><li>The only thing that gives their shawarma taste is their thina and the hot sauce.- pitas are the cheap, paper-thin variety. they use them as a wrap, not as a pita ' pocket' style.- falafel actually is worse than the shawarma ( I think they make it in the morning, and just serve it throughout the day)- owner ( or one of the owners ?), when he works, has 0 customer service skills. not pleasant to deal with The fact that this place is around proves the mantra ' location-location-location'.</li><li>There is no service, just like a takeout shop so dont expect anything.</li><li>TERRIBLE food and service.</li><li>It was the most disgusting service and food I ever had.</li><li>Fyi: I used to eat here few years ago, so I thought I might pay this place a visit since I was in the area and WOW has food and service gone down.</li><li>Tasty food with quick service in a clean restaurant with friendly services.</li><li>I always get good service and have been a regular customer for years.</li><li>This location has great hours and the guys are quick and service is wonderful, falafel you like ??!!</li><li>I 'd come here again to give their shawarma another chance because of the friendly service.</li><li>Service is a bit stoic but I could care less when places like these are primarily takeout oriented anyways.</li><li>Poor service and extremely rude `` manager'' boy.</li><li>The service is slow, regardless of the restaurant 's occupancy.</li><li>In conclusion, I 'm Chinese, if you 're charging me ten bucks for six spring rolls cut in half, they better come with room service, and promise to ' love me long time.'.</li><li>Really bad service.</li><li>Bad service bad food.</li><li>Service is terrible, food quality is awful.</li><li>Good food, poor service.</li><li>The food is decent for the price, the staff is very friendly with excellent customer service love there Pad Thai &amp; rolls.</li><li>I honestly did n't like the service, but we came on Saturday night and they were quite busy.</li><li>Poor service.</li><li>Service was good.</li><li>I thought service was ok. disgusting. absolute shit. it taste horrible and the amount of rice they put on sushi to make you full faster ... and how thin their sashimi is ... oh did i mention that its overpriced ? the waitress is an asshole with attitude ... the manager is an asshole with attitude. horrible service. you have to pay extra for parking as well ... they wont validate it for more than an hour even though they take forever to make their food. i swear they do that on purpose ... fucking ridiculous.</li><li>Decided to try the sushi menu one night with a coworker after work and liked how the service was great- forgot his name but he was an older Caucasian gentleman with dirty blond hair tied in a low pony tail.</li><li>If you ever want great service- get him!</li><li>Service is non- existent- too much attitude from the servers.</li><li>When they had 1 or 2 restaurants the food quality was much better and the service was great, it has gone downhill.</li><li>Everything is just very average- except for the service.</li><li>The service is not average.</li><li>All in all, decent Canadian-ized Thai fusion food, nice décor, slooooooooow service.</li><li>We had really bad service from the get go.</li><li>Although we went on a Saturday, it was n't too crowded, which I actually liked because the service would be better and it would n't be too noisy.</li><li>The service was good too.</li><li>Good thing I did n't, I hear no pants no service ?</li><li>Good service but poor food.</li><li>I can understand why some people on here give this place low ratings for food that is n't entirely `` authentic'' and it IS somewhat pricey, but I 've always had excellent service here, and I 've been at least 5 or 6 times.</li><li>Although service was decent, the narrow long table we were all sitting at really could not handle all the dishes that we had.</li><li>But there is something about the way they make it here that it just tastes amazing. it 's a small shawarma place packed between office and condo buildings. there is a tiny patio facing the sidewalk with cheap plastic tables and chears. my colleagues rave about this place due to low prices and friendly service.</li><li>Yummy food and great service.</li><li>The Service is below average.</li><li>Service was not good at all, server seemed bored and uninterested in being here.</li><li>The service was quick and efficient, and the portions were good.</li><li>Unfortunately, it is a little bias that since a friend and I were in a rush, the service would seem slower than if we were running on schedule.</li><li>However, I did manage to keep track of an approximation of time because the service felt pretty outrageous.</li><li>I could see that they have the best intentions and are trying their best to please customers, but I believe its the lack of solid management that caused everyone to scramble with service, cooking, and ultimately poor customer experiences. mmmm not my best brunch/breakfast for lunch experience. they just opened few weeks ago right next to our office so we went there for lunch.</li><li>I love egg benedicts so I ordered a vegetarian option that was not on the menu ( the menu in general is not super veg friendly) for some reason they give you an option of having the eggs hard, medium or soft which I never experienced before in any of the brunch places. bennies just always come soft- otherwise they 're not bennies but hard boiled eggs on top of an english muffin, the portion included only side of fries and two bennies with spinach. no slices of orange, no toast included. total of $ 9 the spinach somehow had very grassy taste. hollandaise sauce was too salty and flavorless ... the whole food tasting experience was just blah. on the other end the service was very nice and even though they confused my friend 's order the replacement came in in matter of seconds and she was charged less. but I 'm not going back for eggs ... maybe will check pancakes or waffles.</li><li>The serving sizes are good and service was average.</li><li>The service was good and fast.</li><li>The service was extremely rushed.</li><li>The place is clean, the service is quick and the employees are happy.</li><li>Arrived at 7:47 pm would not let me eat in Only take out Well I said I will go elsewhere to a restaurant that wants my business Booo island foods bad customer service.</li><li>Service was both fast and efficient.</li><li>Friendly service and a clean establishment to boot.</li><li>Friendly service.</li><li>Nice location, very clean when I walked in, very fast and super friendly service.</li><li>Very very strange, almost unnatural, table service at McDonalds !? ...</li><li>This McDonald 's location is run by head office so I find you get better service then going to a location that is franchised.</li><li>But ever since the upgrade to self serve kiosk, the dine in service has dropped significantly, though you no longer have to wait in line to order, and even if you do, you waiting for maybe one or two person.</li><li>I mean you get what you get it 's McDonald 's, I just wish it was consistent. horrible staff and staff manager-customer service is zero here! customer service attendee started yelling at my mom for asking a simple question regarding her order-avoid this location at all costs! they are so cheap that they even charge for Mayo-get your shit together McDonalds.</li><li>I never experienced any issues with food or customer service here.</li><li>I 'd say the service is great, the price is VERY reasonable ( for the amount of food they give you- the containers barely shut!) and the food is delicious!</li><li>Quality of sushi is amazing, they have unique and tasty rolls, good service, and you can sit back and relax for as long as you like.</li><li>I came again on a Friday night with a friend and the service was a bit slow, but they were quite packed and busy, which is always a good sign:) I ordered the golden dragon roll ( ?) and it took quite a while for it to come out, but aside from waiting, it was well worth the wait because it was amazingly delicious.</li><li>Service was friendly and accommodating, albeit somewhat leisurely than the downtown Sushi joints.</li><li>The service is quick and the food tastes really good.</li><li>Great service.</li><li>The service has always been very efficient and staff are very nice.</li><li>This place is really a solid three stars and a half, but I have rounded down because the service is spotty- depending on who is serving you, and the non-pho meals drag down the grade.</li><li>Decent servings and fast service.</li><li>Service was OK, atmosphere was OK, again, nothing amazing or worth mentioning lol.</li><li>Vietnamese Delight is clean with friendly service and the food is good standard Vietnamese food, I would stop in again when in the neighbourhood.</li><li>A quick and efficient service, the take out containers were the same and the grilled chicken in taste was quite similar.</li><li>The service was average, as there were not many waiters during the time we dined.</li><li>Food is good, service is fast and friendly.</li><li>Pleasant attentive service.</li><li>Awesome service ... very accommodating &amp; quick !!</li><li>Staff was friendly and service fast.</li><li>Quick service and decent value.</li><li>The service is decent for an Asian restaurant, but they are quick, so that 's a plus.</li><li>But this place is getting worse, both in service and cleanliness.</li><li>As for service, overall is okay.</li><li>Service is decent at least.</li><li>The service is extremely fast.</li><li>Service was extremely slow on Sunday 3-4PM.</li><li>Horrible service but decent food.</li><li>And as if that was not bad service enough, the server fought with us for not tipping.</li><li>Despite the fact that they were completely full, the service was quick and friendly.</li><li>More of a 2.5 to be honest, but I deducted half a star because of poor service.</li><li>Now what I really disliked was the service.</li><li>Obviously I do n't expect great service from Chinese restaurants, cause I 'm used to it by now.</li><li>The service is quick, as I expect from any Northern Restaurant which already have some of the food prepared beforehand, often prior to knowing of our coming.</li><li>Although the food tasted good, the price is a little bit higher than average, considering the restaurant 's service and environment.</li><li>The service was prompt and courteous.</li><li>Service and interior has improved very much over the past 5 years ( renovated i dont know when, i was away from toronto for few years).</li><li>The service was very good except an older lady that was there.</li><li>I gave it a 4 instead of 5 because, for the price point they charge, I would expect better service and/or better dining environment.</li><li>To be clear, I am perfectly okay with basic service decor at Chinese restaurants, if I know it 's excellent food and well priced.</li><li>Service was very prompt.</li><li>The food is great but the owner has the worst attitude for someone in the service industry.</li><li>Did n't know that was a pre-requisite for people in the service industry to be nice to customers.</li><li>But the service is good.</li><li>The server had come up to us to give us menus, and generally the service was the highlight of the place. the waitress was polite, and explained every question with patience. the part that failed them was the wait time for the food. some of their special items had run out, but at 10pm or so, right before long weekend that is to be expected.</li><li>However the truth is it is basically a regular waffle, with oreo pieces and chocolate ice cream. literally the opposite. the star they lost was due to extremely long wait time for the deserts, and also the waffles false advertisement. overall service and environment is nice, and the food was decent, so its worth a try, but probably not on a day right before a weekend perhaps.</li><li>But overall service was good and the snowflake was very good.</li><li>Cute place, clean although the service was slow.</li><li>The service is like any other typical Korean cafe and she was friendly enough.</li><li>Bad desserts and bad customer service.</li><li>It 's still a cute place to hang out w/ friends though. service, food, everything was great--especially the atmosphere. super cosy and easily my ( and many of my friends ') favourite cafe in the area try out the cinnamon honey brick bread and their bingsoo! this is the only cafe so far in toronto that serves shaved milk ( instead of regular water which makes it extra creamy and delicious). their servings are always very large so going with a friend is recommended but not necessary. if you 're looking for drinks, their sweet potato latte is the best I 've had in toronto and as for cold drinks, all of their bubble teas are very nice would definitely recommend to try out for anyone in the area.</li><li>Most importantly, they have a service button!</li><li>I would revisit if their service improves.</li><li>Service is friendly, and most of them speak English quite well.</li><li>Overall I 'm happy with the service and will come back some time soon:).</li><li>Service is quick but quite impersonal/cold.</li><li>Service was not too great we got a round of water in the beginning but I was so thirsty I finished mine while waiting for my dessert.</li><li>Also the waitress took away our service button once we ordered so there was no way for us to get their attention for water or get out bill.</li><li>Overall the dish is great on a hot day but service is not good here.</li><li>Our waitress told us that because we were a party of three, if we did n't order something else, she would have to charge us an extra $ 3 service charge because we did n't each order an item.</li><li>The way the service working is unique the lady will come give you the menu with a bell when you ready to order to use the bell to call her.</li><li>The service is OK and the atmosphere is fine.</li><li>Service is fab- I have to give kudos to the ladies who were serving us.</li><li>Went here on Thursday night for wings ... got there at 1:00 am ordered the wings and happened to find one that was littered with hair, not talking about 1 or 2 hairs ... but several hairs ( I wish I took a picture) ... the server tried to tell me that it was not hair but left over cartilage that they missed when cleaning the chicken ( I did n't know cartilage looked like hair) ... the shocking part to me was that she acted as if everything was cool and that I should just put it aside, only after I made enough noise, they finally decided that they would take 1 of the 2 pounds that I ordered off if the bill ... if you ask me ... my whole meal should have been free .... seems like they need to learn a thing or two about customer service.</li><li>Apart from that, the service was sub-par.</li><li>Clean and friends service.</li><li>Greek family run and the service is always good.</li><li>Super friendly customer service, the lady that runs the place makes you feel like family, always welcomes you with open arms it makes the place extra cozy.</li><li>The service was good and the burgers were surprisingly delicious.</li><li>I do n't care for the food, service ( was n't bad just did n't leave mark) or the atmosphere.</li><li>The atmosphere was great, service great and a very nice, relaxed place.</li><li>Very limited parking in this dingy plaza ... upon entering this place we were not greeted by anyone at all, the cashier did n't even bother saying a single word, Infact the entire time at this place the only word that was spoken to us by the cashier and waitress combined is $ 15.50 ..... there goes their tip and customer service, we decided to just seat ourselves where a table had menus on it, the waitress did n't give us tea and ordering slip til 10mins later .... typically pho place that 's very cheap like $ 7 a dish depending on what you order The whole entire time I did n't hear a single word from the waitress and she looked so pissed off, did n't break a smile but oh well Mediocre food, nothing special and honestly I 've tasted better bun and com dishes elsewhere.</li><li>Service is quick and efficient.</li><li>Service is just ok.</li><li>Their service is typical of all authentic Viet restaurants.</li><li>Price is reasonable, food amazing, but do n't expect much service or deco.</li><li>5 stars for food 2 stars decor 4 star service ( almost none existence.</li><li>Service is competent but not all that friendly.</li><li>Service is speedy and they get the job done, but I would have liked it if they were a little nicer.</li><li>My favourite pho spot in Toronto, food never disappoints and fast service.</li><li>Service is ok though since you ca n't expect good service from Asian restaurants.</li><li>Service is ok though since you ca n't expect good service from Asian restaurants.</li><li>Note* no customer service here.</li><li>This place is definitely worth a try, just do n't have such high hopes for the service.</li><li>Great service here too, make sure to check it out for fresh and tasty food!</li><li>Service is fast too.</li><li>A note of warning, though: do n't expect good service.</li><li>The service was fast, portion and price are great value and taste is authentic as can be.</li><li>Friendly service and great cheap food.</li><li>Let 's just say the focus is on the food and not on anything else. lol The service: Service was prompt, and when I asked for extra limes and basil, the waitress was n't stingy on it.</li><li>Let 's just say the focus is on the food and not on anything

they do get your food right, the service is n't worth it.</li><li>The outside looks kind of sketchy, but once you go inside you will not regret it The service is fast and friendly.</li><li>The service is always quick and the staff are fluent in English Vietnamese and Cantonese.</li><li>Great service with a smile.</li><li>It 's personal hands on service from the owner Rocco.</li><li>Great service.</li><li>Fast service.</li><li>The service was n't as good as last time I was there.</li><li>One more bad service run like that I may have to make this a two star and not bother coming here ever again until someone convinces me otherwise.</li><li>This was clearly false as the coupon does not say this and it was verified by entertainment.com We did n't want to complain so we ordered pop. We were then neglected for the duration of the meal and given sub par service.</li><li>Service was good.</li><li>Only reason I 'm giving this place a 3 and not a 4 or 5 is because of the service.</li><li>Service was friendly and I did like the decor and the way the room was broken up.</li><li>But YEAH YO. for price and service it 's a pretty good place.</li><li>In a food court full of the usual suspects ( Taco Hell, McDogFood, etc) this place stands out for exceptional value and service.</li><li>This Popeyes has good chicken and service is usually friendly and efficient.</li><li>Service is also fast on site.</li><li>Worst service ever.</li><li>Very friendly staff with excellent service.</li><li>The service from popeye itself is good.</li><li>Overall, the customer service, presentation and the taste, I give it 4 outta 5.</li><li>The parking is still a nightmare, however this is one of the better locations with good service and fresh chicken.</li><li>Service from all the staff is excellent.</li><li>Service: A bit slower than any good steak house.</li><li>Review: The service was a bit slow considering their price for a meal but the food was good.</li><li>Probably not good enough to justify their slow service but it was decent.</li><li>To sum up in Miller in one sentence: Steep prices for average food and below average service.</li><li>Poor service.</li><li>It was fine, but I could find that kind of food at a Jack Astor 's and have better service.</li><li>I am angry because I spent good money there, and the service was horrible, and they did not offer any apologies or admit wrongdoing.</li><li>Great atmosphere, great food, good service ( service level dropped a little bit through out our meal), and prices are not bad for what you get !!</li><li>The service was just excellent &amp; our waitress was very attentive.</li><li>The service is awesome, I just have to note that again!</li><li>The service is top notch, even when you 're sitting in the bar area.</li><li>The service was very professional and attentive.</li><li>Awesome service paired with awesome food!</li><li>The prices were very high and more on a par with a top notch downtown restaurant; they are certainly not reflective of the food or service at the Miller.</li><li>The atmosphere was very calm and relaxing and the service was great.</li><li>Service is friendly and gracious to a fault.</li><li>Thanks for the great service.</li><li>Pretty big place, outdated in its decor, mediocre service and food is ok.</li><li>Service- 3/5 Taste- 3/5 Portion- 4/5 Atmosphere- 2/5 Price- 3/5 Service- service was okay.</li><li>Service- 3/5 Taste- 3/5 Portion- 4/5 Atmosphere- 2/5 Price- 3/5 Service- service was okay.</li><li>Service was very slow- the meal took two and half hours and our bus boy needed to yell at our server multiple times to get our check.</li><li>As for the rest, friendly enough service and nice civilized vibe but it 's just a bit overpriced for what you get in terms of food.</li><li>The location is great, the food is average and the service sucks!</li><li>Let 's talk about the service.</li><li>Your service really sucks.</li><li>Service is great, food is even better.</li><li>Both times have excellent service, even though they were very busy.</li><li>I 've been to Millers for lunch many times and usually the service is fantastic.</li><li>Went for brunch on a Sunday, the service was awful.</li><li>For an $ 80 brunch for two I was disappointed and will not come back for the crappy service and mediocre food.</li><li>The food though is really good as I shared: Charcuterie Board ( $ 14)- cured &amp; smoked meats, house made pâté, mustards, pickles, and bread While I nibbled off from my friend 's: Calamari ( $ 14)- lemon mustard aïoli, chilies and Shrimp Cocktail ( $ 16) Service was not the greatness this time .... our waitress was a little cold but I was too busy having a great time with my fellow yelpers to notice.</li><li>Overall, I really enjoyed the food, drinks, ambiance and service, so definitely willing to come here more often now.</li><li>Exceptional service at the Miller Tavern this evening, we dropped in for Happy Hour which runs weekday evenings for 3 + hours.</li><li>Although there was n't much service, it 's still `` enough'' service for such a busy lunch hour.</li><li>Although there was n't much service, it 's still `` enough'' service for such a busy lunch hour.</li><li>Service was Mediocre.</li><li>A few small changes to food quality and service would bump this up to a solid 4/5 restaurant.</li><li>Did a bday dinner with 17 guests, and found the service to be slow and some what poor.</li><li>We both enjoyed our delicious meals and we also liked the quick service.</li><li>I have nothing to complain about, the atmosphere was good, the food was superb ( I had a steak and shrimp) and service was great.</li><li>The service has mainly been good, but slower on the patio where it can take longer to get a drink and you might have to ask more than once for water.</li><li>Service was warm.</li><li>Service was friendly and attentive, and the steaks a good size with generous sides.</li><li>Very good service, great food and nice atmosphere.</li><li>Great great restaurant ... have been going here for years ... under a different owner ... never the less I continued to get the same amazing service ... staff us very attentive ... must try everyone is the portobello mushroom salad ... for our main entree we always ended making our dish picking from different entrees ... wat I do miss is a grilled jumbo tiger shrimp the previous owner used to make me .... he said it was my special thing .... and mayb an addition of a triple chocolate cake/cheese cake .... it wud make a difference in the desert ... it did enjoyed today 's tirimisu.</li><li>The restaurant has nice amount of seating and the service was good.</li><li>Our server was very quick in providing drinks ... so the service was decent.</li><li>The service was exceptional.</li><li>Restaurant was a little empty but had great service and the food was pleasant.</li><li>The food was really great, as was the service!</li><li>I am thrilled to expose them to such a fine establishment and I was even embarrassed by the low tip my buddy left so I had to top it up to 25% ... the service, the atmosphere is just incredible.</li><li>Great food and service.</li><li>The waiter who served us was nice, low-key and provided impeccable, professional service.</li><li>We were greeted by very friendly staff and excellent service.</li><li>Service: The wait service is excellent AND the owner if the restaurant comes and waits as well while greetings clients.</li><li>Great food, great service.</li><li>The food and service is good.</li><li>Service was just ok.</li><li>Suggested minimum service charge was 18%- did n't quite matched the quality of the service though.</li><li>Suggested minimum service charge was 18%- did n't quite matched the quality of the service though.</li><li>When we finished and the bus boy ( who gave the best service of the night) cleared our table we sat there for several minutes before our server came to take my cup for a refill ( which I declined).</li><li>I was skeptical at first when I read the not-so-good reviews, but unfortunately some of my fellow Yelpers are right -- ok food at best, but mediocre service for what 's supposed to be a country club-esque establishment.</li><li>The service left much to be desired.</li><li>Overpriced bland food and horrible service.</li><li>Atmosphere was good, and the service was fine.</li><li>Service! made us feel as distinguished and privileged as I possibly could in my Blue jays jersey and snap-back on.</li><li>For good service and great food, I would always recommend this place.</li><li>The espresso was great and the service was fast and friendly.</li><li>Crap food, expensive, bad service ...</li><li>The service was slow, but this was due to it being very busy ( not the waiter 's fault), but when the food finally came, it was good.</li><li>The atmosphere and food are good as well as the location, but the service is pretentious and petty.</li><li>Miller has great food drinks n service!</li><li>Their service is quite fast, I 've never experienced a problem dining here.</li><li>Second, service ... both of the girls who helped us were super friendly.</li><li>We received very attentive service and good food.</li><li>Service is always excellent.</li><li>Nice and quiet atmosphere, but the service was a little slow.</li><li>The service: 9/10 Servers are friendly and super nice here.</li><li>The service is excellent.</li><li>My mind is n't totally made up about the service as one of the servers was great and the other was a bit of a tool.</li><li>Service is not the best and surprisingly the waitress was n't in a very good mood today.</li><li>Very friendly with good prompt service.</li><li>Kiyomizu won me over by having good reviews and while their service and fish quality was excellent I would rate this place 3 stars as the Toro sushi I ordered was n't spectacular.</li><li>Friendly service, and even more amazing food.</li><li>It 's a very cozy restaurant with great service.</li><li>Service here is A-OK ...</li><li>+ .5

good.</li><li>Excellent food and service!</li><li>Been there 3 times and I am pretty happy about their food and service!</li><li>I went there with my husband with two other friends on Tuesday December 20th and the service and food was great.</li><li>Service: The servers are very friendly, lots of smiles and soft spoken.</li><li>Tucked into a little street branching off of Yonge, Kiyomizu is a restaurant with thoughtful service, fragrant maki, and tempura that pleases.</li><li>Four stars instead of five only because of the small service lapse mentioned above, as well as the high price for veggie tempura ( $ 8 for about 6 pieces of yam seemed excessive- Hockey Sushi will give you 8 for $ 3!).</li><li>First time I went with my boyfriend, it was a pretty good experience so I went back to take more of my friends this past weekend and I was kind of disappointed by how slow the service was.</li><li>Service was okay as well considering it was a lunch rush.</li><li>The service is always terrible.</li><li>Service: service is a hit or miss. The first time I came here I was quite disgusted with the owners level of professionalism.</li><li>I can say that while the food is as you 'd expect from an average Indian restaurant, the level of professionalism and general customer service etiquette is simply nonexistent.</li><li>Service is homely.</li><li>Overall, not bad price ( $ 10) good service and good breakfast.</li><li>I used to come here all the time, food is awesome, service is great but after the renovation I found out they are NO LONGER HALAL, which sucks.</li><li>The service was quick.</li><li>Service was terrible, my order was taken wrong and so were many other customers '.</li><li>I have experienced nothing but friendly, accurate and speedy service.</li><li>Big portions Actually fresh and tender chicken Get the diner

casual, service was friendly.</li><li>Service is lacking.</li><li>Friendly service.</li><li>Friendly service too.</li><li>The service is really good.</li><li>Overall, it was my top two falafel pita in the city, and I would go back simply for the service.</li><li>So ... maybe once or twice a month is better for your cholesterol. its ok, but honestly not as good as suliko ( see my review) which has become the benchmark for CIS restaurants in north york. the service is slow.</li><li>At no fault of the one server working the entire restaurant the service was not good.</li><li>Service is standard and there are n't really any menu items that I would recommend avoiding.</li><li>Service was friendly and very efficient.</li><li>I was here with a larger group of co workers and everything from the

lacking.</li><li>Service is fast and the lunch menu is super fast to order from.</li><li>If that was fast I would hate to see a `` slow menu'' Although the food was adequate the service was terrible.</li><li>The location needs a good cleaning, faster service and a better product delivered to the customer considering the cost of the meal.</li><li>Ambience: 3/5, more of an Asian feel of decor; perhaps because it 's in North York Price: 3/5, fair and great service deserved a big tip.</li><li>I saw four service persons here, and they were all wearing different outfits .. which all looked like uniforms.</li><li>The service is good and the food and drinks are good.</li><li>Good food, service, atmosphere, and reasonably priced given it 's a steak house.</li><li>Service was good though.</li><li>Service was AWFUL. took twenty minutes to even get a glass with liquid in it.</li><li>The servers were fantastic, excellent customer service.</li><li>Their service can be improved and speeded up.</li><li>Somehow the actual service is horrid.</li><li>Every company can deliver bad service once right ?</li><li>If you like dominoes that is fine, but this location is a complete horrid place to expect any decent service from or any actual hot food.</li><li>An entire pizza chain, a customer service executive calling me back from home because she was too sick too go into work.</li><li>Horrible food but even worst by far, was the service and the higher up I complained, the more annoyed dominoes seemed to be telling me well they cannot control franchises.</li><li>And the service was quite good.</li><li>The service tried to be good, but it was obviously forced.</li><li>The service was as good as it needed, but there was no other substance beyond the bare necessity.</li><li>Pros Service was quick Has TV 's on patio Lobster Poutine Appetizer ( $ 10) was great for two people Cons Drinks did n't taste good, we had the Tropical Sangria $ 9 and James 'son $ 8.</li><li>The service was good, but the food just did n't match up.</li><li>The food is good as any location but the service each time I 've gone here has been lacking.</li><li>You get service with a smile but it 's like a terrified one where you know they are thinking they 've made a mistake and are hoping the punishment is painless.</li><li>Excellent service and ultra comfy red leather booths to kick back in.</li><li>The seafood pasta is a great choice Service was lovely, our waitress the last time i was was there was lovely.</li><li>Was here on Oct31st Server was Miranda, quick efficient and

http://static2.px.yelpcdn.com/photo/GdMtUPz_ AkYaAXBHOuj_ Ag/l) but service, portion sizes, the chain 's avoidance of Outbacking it up for yucks with dumb menu names, and for a varied group with varied tastes this will least offend, that brings the experience up to a shaka zulu ( http://static4.px.yelpcdn.com/photo/xEteN-dt9mpHha1Fyq1U6w/l).</li><li>The service was quick and staff was

restaurant once 10 years ago, but I left because I waited in their waiting area for 20 minutes without a hint of service and it was n't even busy.</li><li>The service is great though.</li><li>The 4th comes from averaging that with the 5 star service.</li><li>Their fish is always fresh and the service is always friendly and fast.</li><li>The service is fast, friendly, and welcoming and the food is absolutely delicious and flavorful.</li><li>This location, a little smaller than the others, has the usual great selection- staff who are trying their best to ensure they 're giving good service, and of course, the child play pen.</li><li>It 's mostly due to the service.</li><li>My parents had taken some friends out there for dinner and was appalled by the service and the layout of the tables.</li><li>Great options as always with excellent service.</li><li>Service was fine for this kind of restaurant.</li><li>Service is a bit slow ( but there 's only one person there- strange I know) Compared to Sunrise; By far Sunrise will win when it comes to rice and peas w/ oxtail/jerk chicken/curry goat.</li><li>Service is always friendly .. even friendlier if you 're a pretty girl lol.</li><li>---- Delicious sandwich, super cheap, hilarious service.</li><li>Cozy, quaint, authentic, great service and lunch specials with good portions and also licensed so you can enjoy a glass if wine or beer!</li><li>Three star food with five star value and service.</li><li>The service was not a 100% but i admit it was very busy when we arrived, also they redeemed them selves by acknowledging the slower service and apologized.</li><li>The service was not a 100% but i admit it was very busy when we arrived, also they redeemed them selves by acknowledging the slower service and

waiter who is patient and knowledgeable.</li><li>The first time was great, they had just opened, the service was good and the food reasonable.</li><li>However, the service and food declined with each experience it seems.</li><li>The service is terrible.</li><li>Service has been excellent here and the wait staff is good about filling water.</li><li>The middle eastern cuisine, fresh food, quality best and the service 10/ 10.</li><li>Pros Great Dessert Good food Not really any service Cons Meat came after the salad Looked stupid waiting for the waiter to take our order ... will look cool next time i guess.</li><li>This place is a joke, worse service I have ever experienced.</li><li>I payed and gave them the 15% tip expecting good service.</li><li>I do n't mean dumping literarily, but there was no service hospitality, the plates were casually placed on top of other plates!</li><li>As for the food, the dipping appetizers were very tasty, but all the meats were dry, the tabuli rough and crunchy and the service was absolutely ABYSMAL.</li><li>The service was exceptional in Dundas Square, all the staff were awesome and took care of ordering and bringing over the food.</li><li>Very clean quick service.</li><li>Service was fast and ppl working here seemed to be enjoying their job.</li><li>Service is top notch.</li><li>Overall the food was good and the service was very good.</li><li>Slow service.</li><li>Maybe I want to pay by credit card and add a tip, but I do n't know if the service warrants it before I eat.</li><li>Place has been open for a while now while the food is `` ok'' I do not understand how the service ( even though friendly) can be so chaotic.</li><li>And their service absolutely crumbled to the pressure.</li><li>We ordered some bbq chicken and a beef pepperoni pizza, it was weird that we had to pay first, so one is forced to tip ahead of getting a good service- which leads me the part where I explain that there was barely any greeting from the server and no indication that I had remember my table number before making the order on the other side of the restaurant.</li><li>I can see what the others have said about service being a problem- when I was there the was hardly anyone else there and service was a bit messy.</li><li>I can see what the others have said about service being a problem- when I was there the was hardly anyone else

as they clearly do n't get the meaning of full service.</li><li>They had so many staff around I do n't understand why they do n't have table service.</li><li>I 'll go Lara 's Restaurant or Esquire nearby for similar food which is better and is either full service or fast food.</li><li>Service- 4 stars The server was very nice and curteous.</li><li>When I dine-in, I expect to receive full service.</li><li>Food is okay but service is terrible.</li><li>The Friendly Greek 's food and service have impressed me the times I 've visited.</li><li>They have a couple choices of beer on tap and the casual service was quite attentive and friendly without being overwhelming or stifling.</li><li>Service was good ... attentive and friendly.</li><li>Yes the service is slow and inefficient and the owner has only one debit machine, and yes it can be SUPER annoying when you are in a hurry.</li><li>The service was perfect and the food delicious.</li><li>Service was excellent.</li><li>This is when my wife had a bad feeling about the service and suggested that we leave, but I decide to give it a chance- which later I regretted.</li><li>Overall, horrible service, food just average, and it was overpriced for what we got, and NOT family friendly at all!</li><li>My only tip for the restaurant owner is this- PLEASE work on your customer service and on your menu.</li><li>Final note: I went to this restaurant over 15 years ago, and I remember the food AND service was much better back then.</li><li>Mama is no nonsense and efficient ... do n't expect professional service.</li><li>It 's a small place and entirely family run, so the service is sometimes slow and they will sometimes run out of specials, because I guess they make only so many/night, but that just proves the family-run business atmosphere and the homemade food.</li><li>Worst excuse for a pizza I 've seen, awful service.</li><li>Kinda old school in terms of atmosphere and service.</li><li>Service is prompt and friendly.</li><li>Service was great.</li><li>Service was prompt and kind and the establishment is literally spotless.</li><li>Looks like the Scotish have left and so has the character, quality, and service ... shame.</li><li>Service is friendly and the atmosphere is pleasant.</li><li>Fish and chips have always been good as has the service.</li><li>The service was horrible here.</li><li>They always give good service.</li><li>Area to improve: service- I had to ask for someone to take order, had to ask for bread, and had to ask for a water refill.</li><li>The pasta dishes are way over priced for what you get ( in terms of quality, portions sizes are decent) Very poor service.</li><li>Service was pleasant and started off well but became a little spotty later on.</li><li>I 'd definitely go back to this restaurant again to try out their other menu items. family owned italian restaurant. short summary: very yummy food, portions could be bigger, sometimes slow service but very friendly lady owner, always packed at lunch, which is frustrating since they dont accept reservations. longer summary: the decoration of the restaurant is very cozy and gives a feeling of a patio dining even though it 's all indoors. the service though slow is very friendly and we often end up chatting with the owner for few minutes while we 're waiting for the order. it usually gets very packed at lunch by the people from surrounding office buildings. and since they do n't accept reservations sometimes it means that you have to arrive right after the doors are open ( which is 1130am everyday I think) in general very welcoming place but a bit on a pricey side.</li><li>I 'd definitely go back to this restaurant again to try out their other menu items. family owned italian

the facts: Service was a little crazy because there were a couple of mix ups and the gentleman behind the counter was getting irate ...</li><li>It 's a service industry my friend ...</li><li>This was only my second time at the burger franchise but both times have been good with the service being quick as well.</li><li>Slow service ( again inexperienced cooking staff) 3.</li><li>Sometimes, you just want a glass of vino with your burger to step it up a notch and take your McDonald-like experience to a whole new level. great burgerBUT messed up my order even tho the large foot tall number token was very obvious. had to leav- left beer- king east location- rap music and noise level was so loud I was shocked no one complained. fries and burger tasty hate that the service was non apparent must line up to order- no table ordering food no condiments on table or napkins even! pros- meal `` deal''. came to 14 $ for small jr burger a fry and a beer. not sure that 's a deal.</li><li>Service was blase at best.</li><li>4 stars for yummy juicy burgers, and good service.</li><li>I had no issue with service or restaurant operations as many people here seem to have had, thought it was fine.</li><li>The place is pretty clean, quick service and alot of room to sit. only thing is cash order area where cash is a bit small, not alot of people can fit but it good food.</li><li>There is always plenty of seating and the service is nice and friendly.</li><li>But this location has mediocre service.</li><li>Being at Bayview Village with higher end food establishments with superior service, getting a premium burger without the service does n't seem right.</li><li>Being at Bayview Village with higher end food establishments with superior service, getting a premium burger without

service is very honest.</li><li>Although, I never found the service to be rude in any way.</li><li>The service here is absolutely atrocious.</li><li>However, the service ruined any possibility of having a good time.</li><li>But the service is absolutely disgusting.</li><li>The service is quick, but unfriendly- the feeling is the the servers would rather be some place else on that day.</li><li>Service was fine in my books, my only interaction with our server was to order and to ask for the bill.</li><li>Mediocre food, service is horrible.</li><li>Service was good and parking was alright during peak hours.</li><li>Service is, well, typical Chinese restaurant.</li><li>The service was pretty horrible too.</li><li>The service is average and do n't expect much.</li><li>Service is ... well, it 's a Chinese restaurant, service is n't their top priority.</li><li>Service is ... well, it 's a Chinese restaurant, service is n't their top priority.</li><li>The service here is in

n't.</li><li>The service was rushed though the food arrived fairly slow.</li><li>If you are looking for the best quality of service and price, this is the bar to go.</li><li>I will definitely be coming back here !!! arviderci Paolo see you soon! this is a really cute place close to my neighborhood, my boyf and i decided to come here after i read some good yelp reviews ( id seen the place before but never got around to actually trying it). the service was so friendly and he gave us 2 coffees for the price of one which was very sweet. i love the decor and music, its very old-timey. i ordered a chicken sandwich and he ordered an eggplant sandwich, which is vegetarian, and they were really good, my only gripe would be that the bread is a bit dry. otherwise its a really nice little place with reasonable prices.</li><li>The service was great, the italian couple owners are really friendly.</li><li>WORST SERVICE EVER !!!!!</li><li>The crazy Middle eastern woman was so rude and disrespectful we could n't believe how bad she was in customer service.</li><li>Service is shit, not to say they 're bad people but they suck because they 're not welcoming at all and have a bit of arrogance.</li><li>For best service, phone ahead for pick-up.</li><li>Service was terrible and the cheese on the burritos was n't even melted because they wrapped the burrito the wrong way.</li><li>Servings/Scoops are small ( had to keep asking to get about a total of 1 tbsp of tomatoes) and they definitely give larger servings and preferential service to the high school crowd ( that probably make up a very large portion of their sales).</li><li>The service was good too.</li><li>Service was n't exactly friendly or welcoming which is kind of sad.</li><li>She, does not have the same service as the worker.</li><li>Like other reviews have stated, service is not particularly friendly but the burrito was quite delicious.</li><li>And yes, the service may not be all that; but one still needs to give this place a chance.</li><li>Worst service ever !!!</li><li>To my surprise, the portion sizes here were generous, the food pleased even my ever-so-critical parents, and the service, though pretty lacking in the earlier part of the evening improved drastically towards the end.</li><li>The service was quite slow towards the early part of the evening.</li><li>However, as the early diners vacated their tables, the service improved and the servers were friendlier towards the end of our night.</li><li>It has also usurped Trapper 's as our go-to restaurant for Winter/Summerlicious- another tradition that we never miss. As I mentioned, the service was a little lacklustre but the food will more than make up for it.</li><li>However, they treated everyone else with the same great service.</li><li>Tutto Pronto is great hidden gem that deserves to be recognized for great service and remarkable food.</li><li>I came with a large party and it was thoroughly enjoyable- good wine choices, hearty food, helpful service.</li><li>Lack of service simply wrecked the experience.</li><li>Service is horrible !!</li><li>The food was good but the service was the worst ever.</li><li>Service is fast, friendly with smiling Philipino ladies telling you what they like if you ask.</li><li>Food is great, service is great.</li><li>Nice vibe, great tasting food and quick service.</li><li>Always have good service ..</li><li>The service reminds me of Filipino aunts.</li><li>Overall the service was pretty fast, friendly ( where the manager/owner ?</li><li>The wait can be rather long, and the service sub-par.</li><li>Service is really quick, and portions are amazing for the prices.</li><li>Really authentic experience and friendly service.</li><li>The service here is fast and friendly.</li><li>Also very friendly service as a cherry on top, none of that if you do n't look Filipino, or speak tagalog you go on the back burner which I 've experienced at some other Pinoy places in Toronto.</li><li>The service has never been rude, but the employees are often seen bickering with one another.</li><li>I 've been a York student for four years and I try coming back to Berries &amp; Blooms to give it a shot every so often and I 'm always disappointed with their service- everyone is so rude and does n't have the time of day for you.</li><li>The only thing is that service can sometimes be pretty bad.</li><li>Service is n't particularly friendly and the seating is really cramped.</li><li>Customer service has also gone down hill.</li><li>The service is terrible and I would agree with the other reviews in that sense.</li><li>The service is slow, and the woman I dealt with today was on the phone on a personal call when I arrived.</li><li>My 3 star review most for the service though.</li><li>The plates that you eat with are moon shaped plates The service was relatively quick possibly because it was a week night.</li><li>Customer service is wonderful.</li><li>This one seems to have better broth and service is also better.</li><li>The service here is pretty good.</li><li>The service is lightning fast and polite.</li><li>The service is always very fast and accommodating as I usually ask for extra limes or a small dish of nuoc cham even when it does n't come with the dish.</li><li>Service is quick and on point.</li><li>Service is quick and food is always piping hot.</li><li>Good and cheap food, not the place to be if you 're looking for service or ambiance, but it 's your typical Vietnamese place.</li><li>Super fast service, great for a quick lunch.</li><li>The service is really quick and the quality is amazing.</li><li>Service was quick and to the point.</li><li>Overall, the restaurant is exactly what you would expect of a Vietnamese pho restaurant chain ( such as 88 or pho xe lua), quick to the point service and decent food!</li><li>If you 're expecting fine dining, this noodle house is n't the best establishment to walk into, but adequate service, good, wholesome Vietnamese cuisine and affordable prices make it a must for any pho soup fan.</li><li>Service: quick and they always take my `` special'' order without any issue Ambience: the restaurant is always busy with many tables but the turnaround time is quick, you usually dont have to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated Food: we always order the shrimp fresh rolls and PHO, everytime it 's fresh but the soup broth is the reason why we come here ... its light, not oily ( like some of the other locations) and TASTY!</li><li>Service is fast and indifferent ... good place to a fast pho fix!</li><li>Good stuff: service was quick and staff were average nice.</li><li>FAST service for pretty good food.</li><li>The service here is quick and efficient.</li><li>The food is always good and service is fast and friendly.</li><li>The service was fast and the food was tasty and not to forget the price was cheap.</li><li>I would just say the service was bad today- and they were n't short staff at all ....</li><li>Service is fast and friendly and this is quite impressive because they are almost always packed to capacity.</li><li>The restaurant is family friendly and service is quick.</li><li>Service: The service is decent, nothing bad or exceptional which is pretty common for most Vietnamese restaurants and the food comes out pretty quickly depending on what your ordering.</li><li>Service: The service is decent, nothing bad or exceptional which is pretty common for most Vietnamese restaurants and the food comes out pretty quickly depending on what your

whether it is busy or not.</li><li>Portion is huge, price is on point and the service was fast and friendly.</li><li>Taste is so so and service is really terrible ..</li><li>This location gets really busy so service can sometimes take a while but I always order drinks/food from this location to-go.</li><li>The service there is very fast and the staff is amazing!</li><li>Not recommended .. but service is good.</li><li>The service is not anything note worthy.</li><li>Horrible service.</li><li>Price is great and service is fast.</li><li>Service can be slow when they 're busy.</li><li>The service is really really slow, but should be expected since the ginseng chicken needs to be cooked by the waitress 3 times per table, including all other tasks they have to do ( they look really tired) I have been here a few times and all at bad timings because the restaurant is always full, each time the waitress tells us it 's a really long wait and they do n't know how long, in a tune that they want you to not wait and just leave.</li><li>Now the reason for the 2 stars is the service.</li><li>Tips are optional, based on good service and I reserve the right to tip.</li><li>The service is nice.</li><li>Horrible service.</li><li>Service is very friendly and efficient.</li><li>The service is OK and the food comes out pretty fast.</li><li>I think me and my buddy dusted three orders of those in no time The service is so so Sometimes they are good and helpful Sometimes they forget orders or do n't tend to yourself as quickly as some other places I find they try to rush you given their size of the restaurant and getting other patrons in Hopefully they can expand cause they can get lots more patrons in !!!!</li><li>The service was okay.</li><li>Staff here are great- service is quick and very attentive.</li><li>Service is fast too.</li><li>Service is decent and there 's always one lady that whisks away the empty plates the moment you take the last piece of sushi.</li><li>Well priced for the quality and service offered.</li><li>Service was excellent ( you just had to be a little more proactive to get their attention when the place was busy).</li><li>This place was A + in not only food, but actually service!</li><li>An AYCE sushi restaurant with not only great food, but attentive, friendly, and quick service.</li><li>Service was very good, and the food came very fast, staff were friendly and most of the orders arrived correctly.</li><li>Service was friendly and efficient.</li><li>Service was good the waitress girl who served our table was nice.</li><li>Based on the last couple of experiences, the service has been getting worse and worse since they first opened.</li><li>- Service is EXTREMELY slow.</li><li>I just wish their service was better/faster.</li><li>The service was good,.</li><li>Service ( 4.5/5): So their staff was n't particularly friendly or anything, but we got food FAST.</li><li>We just had fast service all throughout the night, plates were gone in a jiffy when we finished them, so overall really great AYCE experience.</li><li>The staff definitely needs to improve on getting the customer the correct order and not bring out the wrong items. for that- 1star As for service in general, the staff is friendly and quick.</li><li>I also love how quick the service was, from picking up the order to delivering it, despite the fact that the place was packed.</li><li>This place has really quick service and I actually love the smaller atmosphere.</li><li>The service is decent, having them messing up our order 2/4 times we have been there.</li><li>Service was pretty good once we were seated.</li><li>I will give this place another try since my previous times here, the service was n't like this.</li><li>The somewhat poor service ( due mostly to a high customer-to-server ratio) is mostly overshadowed by the quality of the food.</li><li>Service was quick and courteous.</li><li>The reason I 'm giving it 3 stars is because service was fast and quality of the food is higher then other AYCE.</li><li>Sushi legend has a wide selection of fresh sashimi, high quality meats, and fast service.</li><li>Service was ok.</li><li>Was really busy but service was good.</li><li>Able to.maintain the food quality, very attended staff, friendly, service in good standard, sashimi is always fresh, sushi rolls has the right portion of rice, weekends they serve scallop sashimi, spicy tuna hand roll, variety of good quality sashimi choices. reasonable priced and dessert is average.</li><li>Service is also fast and they rarely forget our orders ( which has happened many a times at different AYCE restaurants).</li><li>The place is clean, the service is good and fast too, you should reserve in advance if you come in peak hours otherwise you have to wait for quite a long time.</li><li>3.5 for service.</li><li>Place was almost packed but still had somewhat attentive service.</li><li>Service was quick!</li><li>Service was about average, as it was as good as any other AYCE place.</li><li>Fast and efficient service and pleasant servers.</li><li>Overall i find that this is a sushi place that takes longer then average to get food out, The service was okay, it was not bad, or great. and as you can see from the theme of this review, its that everything is average. its hard to give it less or more then 3 stars as nothing really popped out to surprise or amaze me.</li><li>The food is good, sushi is great and the service was even better.</li><li>The service is quick, fast, and efficient.</li><li>I have to say service is efficient.</li><li>2 stars just for the seamless service in that regard.</li><li>It has the standard fare of sashimi, rolls, hot foods, cold apps, dessert and drinks, just as it does with forgetful service and not serving you 100% of what you asked for.</li><li>Service was quite wonderful.</li><li>They also include fountain pop at no additional cost, but more importantly the service is very good compared to a lot of other places.</li><li>Service was very fast.</li><li>Super fast service, nice ambience and the sashimi was delicious!</li><li>Variety is great; service is better than most sushi places, at least for AYCE ( like they do n't forget items that you 've ordered and the staff are reasonably friendly); I just wish it was cheaper ...</li><li>Prices went up service has n't changed so not entirely impressed.</li><li>Service is quick, efficient, prices are reasonable, the mackerel sashimi is n't partially FROZEN when brought out ( yes, that 's happened to me ...), and the tempura ...</li><li>Management is also very friendly and service is great.</li><li>We were not pleased at the end based on quality and service.</li><li>Service is mediocore.</li><li>2, Consistency- Taste, service and time.</li><li>Service is great, food comes out fast and never been told last call.</li><li>Establishment was clean, service fair.</li><li>The service was alright, overall a pleasant experience.</li><li>The service could be improved.</li><li>Service was great and definitely better than others.</li><li>Service was great, staff were readily available and items were served as ordered ( I am sure it is the bane of everyone 's AYCE experience when ordered items are MIA).</li><li>The sushi/sashimi quality is fairly good ( some more than others, I guess it depends on the day), the grill items are decent but everything else is ... meh ... the service here is also pretty typical of an AYCE place: slow and unfriendly.</li><li>My only complaint is that the service is super slow- we waited about half an hour in between our first and second orders.</li><li>Service is quick and friendly. went for lunch before and went again for dinner, the sashimi were fresh and thick cut the way they are suppose to be and the beef and the scallop sashimi was delishhhhhh !!!</li><li>Good food, fast service, nice portions ...</li><li>Also i like the service, they are very nice and very quick.</li><li>FAST and great service.</li><li>Service is quick for AYCE restaurant.</li><li>Service is amazing and the servers definitely work hard to clear your table as soon as your finished with a plate.</li><li>4 stars definitely well deserved. loved this place the last time I went =) Decor 's nice, food 's nice, they did forget some dishes, but it was okay =) Overall really nice service!</li><li>The service was somewhat disappointing as they had forgotten our orders more than once.</li><li>Food is very good but the service was spotty.</li><li>Other tables seemed to be getting decent service though so this is more a personal experience.</li><li>Great quality, good service, lots of choices!</li><li>Service is quick Menu is n't the biggest I 've seen but still had plenty of options Food overall is just ok- passable but I 've had better.</li><li>Great service.</li><li>Service is friendly, but gets slower as the place gets more overwhelming.</li><li>What I did not like about this place was the service.</li><li>I liked their quality of food, but it lacked a bit in service and as a result of that I can only give them 3 stars.</li><li>Quick service.</li><li>Have some business sense. the best sushi ever, the most unique rolls, quality ingredients, excellent staff and service, must come back !! puts sushi on the level of heaven.</li><li>Service could have been better.</li><li>Cozy, very fast and nice service, 22.95 for AYCE dinner on a weekday ( Mon to Thur) POP INCLUDED IN AYCE PRICE! love this part.</li><li>No complaints, other than it was a little hard to flag down service cuz we were in the back room and the seaweed salad was so tiny I ate it in one `` chopsticks'' full:

Because of the speed of their service, couple times they got my order wrong in terms of the quantity of food, the choice of food) Service ( 3 stars, quick and response fast but not very personal)- They serve the food too fast, you wonder how they did it. =)- They clean up plates on your table very fast as well, they are constantly looking for plate to take away.</li><li>Food Delivery of food is

service when he paid for our meal but she did n't seem to understand.</li><li>Thank you you guys for good service.</li><li>I have to say, the speed of service, the accuracy of food order and the quality of food is amazing. even the servers are all pretty nice as well. empty dishes/plates do n't last very long on table. as soon as i finish swallowing the food, it does not take more than 45 seconds and the empty plates are gone! 2 minor issues with Sushi Legend.</li><li>Food was good but service was slow.</li><li>I would have given it a 3 star but the service was

clean and friendly service never had a problem.</li><li>The service was terrible they did n't bring us fish sauce, not enough chop sticks, no knife to cut the pork chops, no waters as we wrote down on

your mindset is to get some comfort food, have it fast and have it hot.</li><li>I liked that it was hot ( yes, I know I said it already), noodles were a little dry but the sweetness of the preserves cabbage saved it a little bit- place was clean, service was fast ( I went around 5:30-6)- probably it was midtown, prices were jacked up 1-2 dollars compared to uptown.- overall, you 're going to a diner and this place delivered what a Chinese diner needs to be.</li><li>I was `` wishing'' for a great place that opened late, tasted good, decent in price, and provided decent service .... congee star possesses all of these qualities and more.</li><li>The only positive is that the service was good.</li><li>They get busy at lunch, but they 've never been too busy to seat us quickly, and the service is usually decent.</li><li>The service was pretty good too, not the usual curtness at Asian restaurants.</li><li>The service was great!</li><li>The service was fast and friendly.</li><li>The food is cheap, the service is quick ( once you 're seated), and best of all, it tastes great!</li><li>Love this place, food is fantastic and service is fast.</li><li>The service was a little slow and not very attentive, which is only fault I found.</li><li>Not only is the food delicious but the service is top notch for an asian restaurant.</li><li>The service is always efficient and the waiters are friendly even when you order takeout.</li><li>Service was excellent and friendly but sadly the food was not up to par.</li><li>The restaurant is nice ( and not dirty), the service is fast, they open late, the food is great and the price is right.</li><li>The service was average.</li><li>Pros: Amazing food, fast service, clean, and very cheap Cons: Can be pretty busy at lunch ... but I guess that 's an indicator that people really love this restaurant Recommendations: Congee- all of them are amazing General Tao Chicken- I 'm Filipino/Canadian and you know we love GT chicken!</li><li>Service was great and very quick.</li><li>Fast service, good food and cheap prices- the perfect trifecta.</li><li>The only things that bothered me about Congee Queen were that the service was spotty and it was always crowded.</li><li>I was elated to discover that Congee Star had better food AND better service.</li><li>I recommended congee star for the good food and good service.</li><li>Service is good too, the servers speak English ( not very fluently but good enough) without making you feel weird if you do n't speak Chinese.</li><li>Service was ok, a bit slow.</li><li>The service deserves 5 stars as there are waiters/waitresses offering to help you despite how packed the place gets.</li><li>Unfortunately service was perfunctory and getting the waiter 's attention required constant struggle.</li><li>Service sucked a**.</li><li>I 'm pretty much taking away that star for service, and the fact that i did n't enjoy the rice dishes or the vermicelli.</li><li>Service was quick in the beginning.</li><li>Food wa n't bad but the service was subpar at best, they ignored us after we received our food, bad service out weighs the ok food.</li><li>Food wa n't bad but the service was subpar at best, they ignored us after we received our food, bad service out weighs the ok food.</li><li>McDonalds has better service so do n't waste your time here.</li><li>Upon our departure, waitress made a comment something to the effect that she hopes this does not reflect her service.</li><li>And furthermore, f she was giving proper service, she would have came to check up on us more than once.</li><li>The service was adequate but if I did tip, it would have been 10%, 15% max.</li><li>It 's bus accessible, close to the village at York, and I 've never been disappointed with the service, food, or drinks.</li><li>They service was great the whole night and food was amazing.</li><li>Great food, service and vibes !!</li><li>This place always provides great food and very quick service.</li><li>I also miss Eddie and his smile and passion for his food and service ... i only hope he opened another restaurant and if so i pray i can find it Eddie you were the best and my Family and i thank you for giving us 10 years of amazing food and the joy of eating at your special restaurant what an experience, we will never forget you.</li><li>Overall I enjoyed the food here and the service is decent.</li><li>Service was slow.</li><li>Do n't even know if we could go on our road trip today just because of this meal. visited on tuesday night around 7pm for dinner. the place was packed and noisy. there were only 2 servers + owner lady ? so the service was very slow ( especially they have to cook the food for u at the table). they were so busy and my order was confused but she apologized politely right away so we just ate our meal w/out complain. but i still prefer the downtown location. their food &amp; service is better. and its really hot in the inner part of the restaurant.</li><li>Do n't even know if we could go on our road trip today just because of this meal. visited on tuesday night around 7pm for dinner. the place was packed and noisy. there were only 2 servers + owner lady ? so the service was very slow ( especially they have to cook the food for u at the table). they were so busy and my order was confused but she apologized politely right away so we just ate our meal w/out complain. but i still prefer the downtown location. their food &amp;

washrooms were difficult to find and smell of moth balls, but clean.</li><li>Service is good, as well.</li><li>Service took some time as it was quite busy that Sunday afternoon.</li><li>The prices are fairly reasonable but it 's the service, portion size, and delicious food that keep me coming back.</li><li>Besides the lack of rice for our group 's bento boxes, the service was pretty good, and included a bell in case we needed anything.</li><li>If you are looking for average quality sushi, and hit or miss service, with above average prices for what you get then you have found your place.</li><li>Service.</li><li>The service is OK when the restaurant is slow, but when busy takes quite awhile to get a server to come to the table and for food to arrive.</li><li>With a wealth of other sushi offerings on Yonge street it might be well advised to make a detour elsewhere. alway busy, like ram-crammed. the service tends to be a bit harried, but always friendly. the hae-dup bap is good here, if not typical. except they have two options: japanese-style or korean-style. js is chunks of fish and ks is slivers. personally, i prefer the ks, because the fish gets incorporated into the salad and rice so each mouthful is balanced. nothing to scream about- positively or negatively. just a good option. oh, the lighting is glaringly bright. do n't bring an ugly date.</li><li>Awesome service .... friendly, fast &amp; very accommodating ..... food substitutes is welcome !!</li><li>This restaurant is like someone going through the motions without any care- both the food and the service.</li><li>There is only really 4 things i order from this place. super chirashi ( approx $ 14) enough food for you to take some home salmon chirashi ( $ 10)- never failed me sushi chirashi ( great assortment $ 10) ( accept requests for substitutes if you dont like shrimp, white tuna .. etc) uni sushi ( $ 5/2PCS)- SUPER fresh and not available during off season service can be kinda slow at times and staff tend to be loud when the restaurant is empty and ive seen the kitchen staff sitting next to us eating their meals however, like one of the previous yelper said the chirashi keeps me coming back for more. parking is the worst part about going to this restaurant.</li><li>It 's very clean and the service is always quick and polite.</li><li>Fast service!</li><li>He service was good and that 's why I give 1 star.</li><li>Nice restaurant, friendly and quick service.</li><li>Service is good.</li><li>The service is decent.</li><li>Service is slow and the restaurant was empty with one other table being attend to at 4pm on Sunday.</li><li>Service was swift.</li><li>I live in an area with many sushi options and I find myself returning here because I love the laid back atmosphere, the polite service and the manner in which dishes are thoughtfully prepared.</li><li>Friendly service, good food, decent prices.</li><li>Great service too!</li><li>It 's so easy to opt for something better in North York, so do yourself a favour. food was ok, I know the sashimi is usually fresh and service is quite good usually.</li><li>The service was super fast, two people ahead of me, waited 3 minutes and as I was deciding if I wanted less ice and sugar, they already started my drink, as soon as I said less sugar, less ice, all the ingredients are thrown into the mixer, and made.</li><li>Super fast and efficient service.</li><li>Although this location does n't compare to the Yonge and Finch location but the service was still quick and efficient.</li><li>I pop by here pretty often since I live walking distance away, but the service has always been hit or miss. Some days my order comes out perfect, other days they mess it up and have to redo it.</li><li>The service speed is still lacking compared to the Markham and Richmond hill locations.</li><li>I 'd rather give the business to someone who knows the meaning of customer service ', and I hang up on him this time.</li><li>He said that for dine in service each person must order at least $ 10 worth of food ( to be fair it does state this on the menu) but I pointed out politely that the the place was three quarters empty and it would be pretty unlikely that there 'd be a rush of customers clamouring for our coveted table in the last hour before closing.</li><li>In terms of the service, I found it completely fine and the waiter/cashier was really nice.</li><li>The place is small and family managed, which would normally mean good service, or at least attempted good service.</li><li>The place is small and family managed, which would normally mean good service, or at least attempted good service.</li><li>Totally f' in shocked by this experience, I have nothing to say but, `` you know, your service is really lousy'', to which he replies, `` my service no lousy, your service lousy'' and walks away.</li><li>Totally f' in shocked by this experience, I have nothing to say but, `` you know, your service is really lousy'', to which he replies, `` my service no lousy, your service lousy'' and walks away.</li><li>Totally f' in shocked by this experience, I have nothing to say but, `` you know, your service is really lousy'', to which he replies, `` my service no lousy, your service lousy'' and walks away.</li><li>Great restaurant with awesome food and service.</li><li>Actually, anything is better service than thai bistro.</li><li>Food is good but do n't expect too much on decor and customer service as they totally do n't apply on this Thai joint.</li><li>Service was quick, friendly, and attentive.</li><li>My friend who lives in the area said the guy working the front to take your order is the most unhelpful person, but the food is worth the lack of care in service.</li><li>I know the gentlemen there can be quite a bit of a character but he loves my hubby, so for us it always been great service.</li><li>Fast service.</li><li>Service was actually ok, the guy would come by occasionally asking us if everything 's okay and refilling our water.</li><li>Incredibly attentive service, and a tremendous meal.</li><li>I 've never experienced such bad service in my life!</li><li>We went after the fun comments around service and did n't know what to expect.</li><li>You will always get good service and good food.</li><li>Ignore bad reviews based on service.</li><li>We were so stoked about going there, after that kind of service, it gave me a bitter taste about our vacation in Toronto.</li><li>The service is very efficient and I suppose some would see it as `` rude'', but all in all, fantastic food supersedes all the minus points.</li><li>Great location ( the food in general in this plaza is phenomenal), friendly service, and the drink quality is consistently delicious.</li><li>Had a great selection of teas and nice service.</li><li>In terms of quality, bubble tea is decent, service is efficient; but I 've had better at other locations.</li><li>Service was n't exactly the friendliest.</li><li>Service is always perfect.</li><li>Run by bonafide Thai folks, this establishment is friendly, quick service and always great to go to.</li><li>I 've never had problems with their service.</li><li>Delicious food, quick, friendly service; I have n't had any bad experiences with the staff as mentioned in other reviews.</li><li>If customer service is something you really care about, you should probably go somewhere more pretentious.</li><li>Service: great!</li><li>It was n't very busy when we went ( Saturday night) so I ca n't comment on the service during peak hours.</li><li>The service was good and the place is laid out well.</li><li>Service is great and fast, it is a little dark inside, but there is enough room to seat a fair number of people.</li><li>This place is n't much to look at on the inside and I reckon they could do a little work on the outside to give it more curb appeal but the service is friendly and the seating area is well laid out.</li><li>This place has got a great home-y vibe and the service was great, but the soup itself was a little bland, and maybe that 's just be over accustomed to everything else being higher in salt/msg.</li><li>Service is fast and as expected for a typical Vietnamese joint.</li><li>That means you can expect basic service, order from a piece of paper.</li><li>What customer service!</li><li>The service is not that fast but they are kind and nice!</li><li>The dinning room experience is n't the best the service is good just the place fills up with beer drinkers watching the game.</li><li>Downtown Chatime location gets 5 stars largely because of their quick service and that is exactly what the Finch location lacks!</li><li>Service was quick and friendly.</li><li>The only con to this Chatime is the service, they often mix up your order and their system is inconsistent.</li><li>Chatime 's a popular chain of tea shops with consistent quality and service.</li><li>In conclusion, Chatime makes fantastic milk tea, so why is service so horrible ?</li><li>I think I 've received better service at McDonald 's.</li><li>Personally, service is a huge deciding factor on whether I will return, so .. probably not.</li><li>Chatime needs to know what their staff is doing to their customer is n't simply under-satisfying service.</li><li>Near the counter, you will find the following sign: `` If you like our service, rate 5 stars on yelp'' If you 've never been to chatime before and looking up reviews to see if it lives up to the hype .. then shame on you.</li><li>This place is always busy and service is pretty efficient.</li><li>Delicious bubble tea, quick service, and awesome customizable options.</li><li>The only preference is the service could be a bit better.</li><li>Being the service industry in the past, the most important to make your customers feel welcomed.</li><li>This location appears to be your typical Asian service, order, eat/drink and out.</li><li>And then I realize, it was the slow service they have at the desk.</li><li>The service was disinterested and unengaged.</li><li>Service was quick with a smile, and not a big lineup at this location.</li><li>The service is okay here, sometimes there might be communication issues.</li><li>I hope they keep opening up more stores! wow this place was packed service was still pretty fast, it was like an assembly line got the milk tea with pudding for $ 4.50 so refreshing and so addicting I 'm glad I do n't live close to one of these places otherwise I will be more fat than I am now and more broke than I am now.</li><li>Service is fast and friendly.</li><li>Fortunately, their service is quick and you will not be disappointed!</li><li>It looked crowded, but service was quick.</li><li>Very nice customer service.</li><li>Nice drink with nice service, no wonder this place always full of people.</li><li>The service is pretty fast and the bubble tea is one of the best.</li><li>Customer service is horrible.</li><li>My favorite drinks are: Grass jelly roasted milk tea Jasmine green milk tea Honey green tea Red bean green tea smoothie ( brain freeze will occur) Mango green tea Chrysanthemum tea There service is a hit or miss. The cashier may or may not be friendly.</li><li>However the service is EXTREMELY SLOW.</li><li>Would go back many more times if the service was faster, but I doubt I 'll be going here anytime soon until the fad dies down.</li><li>Great service, but their food is just average.</li><li>The service was also notably prompt, efficient and friendly.</li><li>- Service was almost non-existent; our server barely came to our table.</li><li>Such an awesome service, no wonder they are so many years in business.</li><li>The seating inside is plentiful, the atmosphere is nice, and our waiter was just lovely ( he was very friendly and his service stood out), but as I consider food to be the star of the show, I wo n't be hurrying back here any time soon, though I wo n't say I 'd never try it again.</li><li>Price is fair and the service is very kind too.</li><li>Great service.</li><li>Service was fast.</li><li>The service was always helpful and friendly and we did n't have to wait long despite the number of customers already seated.</li><li>Overall, Paisano 's was a good experience- ambient, cozy, great service, and, for the most part, good food- not amazing, but good enough.</li><li>The place was packed, but the service was quick and friendly.</li><li>I would go again. i 've my 2nd visit and i was not disappointment! ... i had the salmon on the 1st visit a nd ordered it again. the service was spectacular ... and that 's the reason why Mike our waiter should be employee of the month !!!</li><li>The service was okay, and I 'm not going to knock the waiter who was fairly new to the job, but we would not recommend this place.</li><li>Service was very good.</li><li>While it may be a little hard to find parking on the weekends, this place has become one of my favourite Italian places due to inexpensive yet delicious food and decent service.</li><li>I 'd give it one star but the service was reasonably polite.</li><li>The service however was below par.</li><li>They have a fairly lengthy menu ( all the usual salad/app/main suspects) and really friendly and prompt service.</li><li>Good food, like the service in restaurant, but will never order pickup or delivery again.</li><li>Service was fantastic.</li><li>Service was good.</li><li>Good service too !!</li><li>We tried the following: Chicken carbonara- tasty and creamy and good sized portion Escargot in herb n tomato sauce- really good, multile pieces of escargot with bread for dipping the remaining sauce Veal mushroom- tasty as well Shirley Temple- refreshing drink Service was also friendly and efficient and prices were reasonable.</li><li>Pros: Pretty good service Prices are fair Cons: Pasta is precooked I 've heard some good things about this place so I decided to come out here for my GF 's birthday.</li><li>The service here on a whole was very good.</li><li>Other than that, it was a great all around experience in terms of service.</li><li>Service was quick and amazing.</li><li>The service was decent and the portions of their dishes are massive.</li><li>Service is good but seems a little rushed.</li><li>I hate to say it but Service here has never been a strong point.</li><li>Overall the service was very good and the food was decent would recommend to try it out.</li><li>The service is very friendly and quick and the restaurant has a very homey and familiar feel.</li><li>You wo n't regret it. service decent food quite good décor-forget it is this an Italian restaurant with the worst non-Italian bread ( non crusty and non tasty ever in an Italian restaurant pizza above average.</li><li>The service was ... generic.</li><li>One of my favourite Italian restaurants in the city, although I was a bit disappointed with the service.</li><li>I 've never been disappointed by the quality of food or service.</li><li>Loved:- The Meat Lover 's Pizza- The Seafood Linguine- The affordable wine list- The friendly, attentive and efficient service- Ample seating, very family friendly.</li><li>The decor was familiar and the service was good but, based on my one-time experience, I can only recommend this place as a watering hole, not a feeding station.</li><li>Service was friendly.</li><li>I really liked the atmosphere of this pub and the service was very homely.</li><li>The service was quick and efficient and the food was super fresh.</li><li>Service can be a tad slow on nights when there is sporting event going on but overall they are pretty good.</li><li>Service was alright.</li><li>It was difficult, because we were a large group, but I still feel like it took too long for service to come around.</li><li>Service was great and everything came hot!</li><li>But the service was slow.</li><li>Service was horrible on this day, the lady who served us seemed to hate us, dropped off food and turned away so fast we could barely ask for stuff, ignored our bell, did n't bring us rice until 15 mins after we got our kamponggi, and took the menu away .. while my friend was reading it o_ O Could be because we were the only ones in there not speaking Korean ?</li><li>Everything on the menu was decently priced ( our bill was under $ 20 for two people), and the service was attentive enough.</li><li>Food was homey and good ( not great) but table coatings were scraped off, outlet sockets were broken and bare, floors were stained black and brown ... as much as I tried to focus on their kind service and good food, the quality of their restaurant cleanliness kept coming into mind as it really just was so run down and dirty.</li><li>I always come for table BBQ, great food, good service.</li><li>Service is typical of family style Korean restaurants but it certainly was n't rude.</li><li>The new owners are even better, portions are big, service is relatively quick, and prices are very reasonable.</li><li>Service was quick and food was very good.</li><li>Cheap, delicious, with good service to boot.</li><li>First time here as I decided to try a different Korean restaurant and I was fairly impressed by how great the service and food was.</li><li>The service was fairly good, they were friendly and greeted us when we arrived and also when we were leaving as well.</li><li>The waitress smiled and although it was fairly busy on a Friday evening, the food, service and overall quality was top notch.</li><li>Most importantly though service was excellent; we were attended to the whole way and the waitress even explained the orders since it was our first time.</li><li>The staff is also very friendly and the service is fast.</li><li>Service gets everything done but is slow because all seating is a small booth so it is hard to see wait staph.</li><li>A bit off the main path but do n't be deceived- great food, good friendly service, will definitely be back.</li><li>Only issue I can see is with service, perhaps under staffed or what ever it is it does n't seem like they are very happy.</li><li>The service does n't come with a smile but it 's efficient.</li><li>Although the service can be slow, it 's only because the restaurant gets super busy- something they are trying to correct given the waitress wanted signs everywhere.</li><li>I do n't think it 's reasonable for any reviewer to dock stars for service or decor.</li><li>Service was below average.</li><li>Indeed, service was not impressive. most people here mentioned there was a rude young waitress.</li><li>Authentic and tasty. good service and individual booths to serve your party comfortably.</li><li>This restaurant is very family restaurant, the decoration, the service style .....</li><li>Some people may say their service is not very good, but I think it is just very Asian-Style.</li><li>Attentive service.</li><li>They have some private booths with buzzers/bells to get service.</li><li>This resto itself is not the cleanest either and service is almost non-existent.</li><li>Service was also very standard and acceptable.</li><li>This family owned restaurant serves delicious food, has efficient service and great prices.</li><li>WORST SERVICE EVER!</li><li>Not only did they let a family bud us in line because they were regulars but had to wait forever for service.</li><li>That said, the service was great, the food was great, the place is clean.</li><li>Extremely good food and excellent service.</li><li>Awesome service.</li><li>Overall, pretty good service ( as their was n't anyone around), but I did have to specifically ask for more water.</li><li>Meal was just fine and the service was good.</li><li>Service was efficient but never checked on us ...</li><li>Great attentive service.</li><li>Service is impeccable and the portions are large.</li><li>The service was pretty quick between taking our drink orders, food orders and when the food came out- surprisingly so since it was so full.</li><li>Service can be a hit or miss. This is definitely your average Italian fare.</li><li>Service was a little bit poor.</li><li>I do recommend the service but not the food!</li><li>The service was great though, she managed a large group of us and helped us pack our food and out the door in a timely manner.</li><li>Service was impeccable- fresh ground pepper and fresh parmesan ready on standby, water refilled without even asking.</li><li>Service, double check.</li><li>The service was good though!</li><li>The reason I put as 3.5 star as the service is ' AWKWARD'.</li><li>I went 3 times before and everytime the service was unusual.</li><li>If the service is better, I will have a higher rating as the food is always good over there!</li><li>Overall horrible service but excellent food.</li><li>Hopefully the service will be next time.</li><li>The service was good though, and the place was getting packed later on the dinner shift so it is a popular place.</li><li>We had great service the whole time.</li><li>Instead of apologizing and trying to make the situation right like they should have if they had any decent customer service skills, they again told me my name was n't on their list and looked at me like I was lying about my reservation.</li><li>Not something amazing .... but very very over priced and the service seems to depend on if you are a regular or not and if you are ordering wine.</li><li>The food is not bad, but the service is horrible.</li><li>Great atmosphere, great service and very good portions.</li><li>I enjoyed all of them except for shiitake mushroom ... the only thing I would say they can improve on is their service.</li><li>The service is warm and goes at the right pace.</li><li>Service is always good and the waitresses are always smiling.</li><li>The service is always pretty friendly and they are open pretty late; which is an extra bonus.</li><li>They have pretty terrible service, I had to get up a couple of time.</li><li>And the service was awesome.</li><li>Amazing service.</li><li>Pizza is like any other pizza nova locations- good, but the customer service was HORRIBLE.</li><li>Unfortunately, I do n't know the delivery man 's name but we always get the same gentleman and his customer service is outstanding!</li><li>Service has been disorganized when it 's busy though.</li><li>Unpleasant service.</li><li>Terrible. service was all over the place !! but got the order correct surprisingly.</li><li>A beautiful, well appointed restaurant with great presentation of food, and good service.</li><li>We thought this would mean fast service but considering we were alone, the speed of service was nowhere near great ...</li><li>We thought this would mean fast service but considering we were alone, the speed of service was nowhere near great ...</li><li>For an upscale restaurant with prices in the $ 18 + range, their service and food was just not up to par.</li><li>The service could be improved.</li><li>The service can go either way- we went here for my birthday and my brother double checked with the waiter that the spring rolls did n't contain any peanuts.</li><li>Truly exceptional service.</li><li>I felt that she did n't even deserve any extra tip because she did n't even provide us with amazing service.</li><li>For me, going to restaurant is about the company, the environment, and the service.</li><li>It 's a wonderful restaurant but service was slow.</li><li>Great service.</li><li>Service was good, and they said they will relay our complaints to the kitchen, we did not get any discount for our complaints.</li><li>The service was very slow, they were down servers.</li><li>Service is still great but tons of other authentic places that are true to their origins.</li><li>My friend and i enjoyed our first experience here. the panang curry was amazing. the flavour and spice was delicious. i got the tofu paneng and she got the beef. the service was extremely friendly at the bar as well as the other servers were very bice too. staff was attentive and courteous and i personally enjoyed the atnsoohere. the lights were too dark, and the decor was appropriate. happy to have had my first experience here be a good one.</li><li>SERVICE- attentive servers, and Linda came by twice to check up on us and chat you up, which I thought was great!</li><li>Do n't get me wrong, I like good service, but some times u get the feeling that they are `` pulling your leg n kissing ass''.</li><li>The service was a cut above and the food was good and satisfying enough to relieve the rigours of a long day.</li><li>APPALLING SERVICE- POORLY TRAINED WAITRESS AND MANAGER.</li><li>There are so many other Thai restaurants out there, with good food and great service ( Pai, Sukho Thai, Eat BKK, Khao San Road etc).</li><li>Are you not going to tell me that there will be disciplinary action towards your staff member because customer service is something you take pride in ?</li><li>I have eaten at a lot of restaurants in my lifetime ( it 's unfortunate I have n't documented them on yelp) and when I have encountered issues with service, 10 times out of 10, I have been offered an apology at the very least.</li><li>Overall I am SHOCKED and have never been so FLABBERGASTED by the ridiculousness of the situation and the lack of service I received from both immature and poorly-trained Jacky as well as her incompetent manager counterpart.</li><li>Sadly, Yelp does n't give the option of NO STARS, because that is definitely what this restaurant deserves if judged by the service ( the food is about a 3).</li><li>Suggestion to you both: put your big girl/boy panties on and start taking customer service seriously.</li><li>Suggestion to Yelpers: avoid this restaurant unless you want to be subjected to seriously terrible service.</li><li>Our server was polite and helpful, although towards the end of our meal, her service levels fell ( empty water glasses, long wait for dessert menu and orders).</li><li>But the service was so so, the waitress who served us seemed really stressed and rushed, a bit abrasive.</li><li>All in all I think this place has potential but really needs to improve on the cleanliness, service and the food portions.</li><li>Service ?</li><li>Pros Nice location Ambiance is good Service is fast Friendly staff Good presentation Red curry was on par Cons Dinner for two $ 74 Duck was smoked and dry, gummy Lamb was as dry as it can get.</li><li>The service has always been friendly, but each time it 's been pretty slow.</li><li>Fabulous service.</li><li>Unbelievably slow service.</li><li>The manager did not make an effort what-so-ever to try to mitigate the issue or try to find out what was wrong with the service.</li><li>First of all, the food is horrible, service is so so but the overall experience was all negative.</li><li>For a quick review: Service for the most part was quick and courteous.</li><li>Service was spotty though as the place was packed and I sat at the corner of the patio.</li><li>C- Service: Our server was lovely.</li><li>The food was a 2, but the service and ambience brought it up to 3.</li><li>The service has always been on point at Linda 's and they have a summerlicious and winterlicious menu select times during the year for people who want to try it out.</li><li>Speaking of wallets Linda is priced very well, its no salad-king but for the quality of food and service it is worth it.</li><li>Terrible service.</li><li>We were disappointed with the level of service and the food.</li><li>He was barely apologetic and offered to replace it but we were unable to wait ( as service was also incredibly slow this evening- I.e.</li><li>The only reason I gave this place 2 stars was that the actual food itself was decent- but we were extremely disappointed and probably wo n't be back due to the poor customer service by management.</li><li>The service needs to be more consistent.</li><li>Service was friendly.</li><li>Not only did they NOT have Siam noodles, the service was snail paced slow, the waitress forgot our water and our spring rolls, the portions vs price were underwhelming and the experience was tasteless and expensive.</li><li>The service is consistently great and the food is superb.</li><li>I 've been here for lunch, for dinner, with small parties and with large groups- the food and the service is very consistent.</li><li>Overall, the service was great, but the food took a while to arrive.</li><li>RUDEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. never again.</li><li>The food, the decor, the service.</li><li>Fresh crispy mango 's + additional vegetation- it was sweet and sour at the same time but not overpowering ... really light and fresh tasting 5/5 Overall a great experience and service was great.</li><li>Great service too!</li><li>Service was great!</li><li>The service was excellent and fast.</li><li>A bit pricy, but the decor, food and service will have to warrant that.</li><li>Was really impressed by the decor and service.</li><li>Service is good though I feel like after visiting Thailand with my boyfriend and being able to taste delicious authentic thai food nothing compares.</li><li>Top stars for service, atmosphere, and most important of all flavour.</li><li>I 'm going to give them two stars instead of one because the service was decent.</li><li>Pros: Very nice decor Good Service Cons: Not much variety on the menu Portions could of been better Hidden automatic gratuity ?</li><li>Mains were pretty good but Service could be better!</li><li>But the service was great.</li><li>However, the service was so horrible the one time I went that I just ca n't see myself recommending this place to anyone.</li><li>$ 20.54 + $ 3.00 tip Customer Service: I have never been more impressed with the customer service at a restaurant.</li><li>The place has really nice ambiance and service but I find the food over priced for the quality.</li><li>Nice wait staff but, both times I went they were understaffed and as a result the service was slow.</li><li>Service was great though.</li><li>You pay a large premium for good service and decor but the food is mediocre and small portion.</li><li>Linda 's is my definition of a GOOD fancy restaurant: Authentic food, moody atmosphere, and attentive service.</li><li>Not too much can be said for the service here.</li><li>The service here is great and the ambience is quite nice.</li><li>The service was very slow and the host at the front was n't the best at it.</li><li>Overall the service by the waitress was good.</li><li>The service at the front was bad.</li><li>Nice decor and good service.</li><li>The restaurant is not too big and looked quite busy during the weekend, but service was quick and the food was delicious.</li><li>Nothing really surprising except the crispy beef brisket, Thats a must have if u r visiting here. service is pretty good as well.</li><li>That was n't enough to endear me --- because there were service issues, and I became sick later that night because the crispy duck was clearly fried in the same oil that shrimp is fried in because staff did n't consider that.</li><li>And he did n't even apologize for such a bad service!</li><li>I would hate to give 2 stars to this place but every time we go there, service is terrible.</li><li>Overpriced and service was n't the greatest.</li><li>Our hostess also doubled as our server and she provided great service.</li><li>The service was lacking, and the food was below average and over-priced to say the least.</li><li>Really liked the service here.</li><li>It was not rushed but we always could get service when needed.</li><li>Overall great food and great service.</li><li>We came at a non-busy time, around 5pm or so, hence being the only ones we had really great service.</li><li>Food &amp; service: courteous &amp; friendly.</li><li>THE BAD:- I understand that lunchtime on Friday is a busy time, but we were really disappointed with the service.</li><li>The service was so great.</li><li>That being said, their service is not the greatest, and there were two occasions that I had a foreign object in a baked goods ( a toothpick and a pit) hence the four star rating.</li><li>Great service!</li><li>I was actually surprised by the great customer service.</li><li>Great service, great coffee ( maybe not* the* best, but consistently an 8 out of 10, in contrast with Tim 's, which ranges from 2/10 to 8/10 depending on the day, humidity, planetary alignment, and other unknown factors) ..</li><li>Like most Starbucks, they have some friendly staff and quick service.</li><li>I come here more than anywhere else in the food court and the service is great.</li><li>I would n't look too much in terms of customer service, but you walk up to the cash register after you finish eating and pay, there is a fridge for drinks, if you are eating for here, and you just grab your drink and settle up the bill after you finish eating.</li><li>Overall, this place is n't bad for grabbing a quick bite with no expectations for service.</li><li>I liked the customer service and the appetizers ( we had fresh spring roll with shrimp and chicken) and mango salad And we had seafood pho!</li><li>It 's a counter-service place, so there 's not much to say about the service.</li><li>The pastrami was delicious, the service was amazing- every person we saw, from the gentleman who took our order and sliced the meat to the guy that cashed us out smiled and cracked jokes, making our experience awesome.</li><li>Cafeteria style service.</li><li>Service at the take out area was fast and very courteous.</li><li>SERVICE NOTES I got my sandwich to go and the wait was pretty much the exact amount of time I 'd like to wait for a sandwich.</li><li>I could say this place was very clean and the service was good, but the restaurant is new, and has n't settled into this hole in the wall which used to be my old dry-cleaners.</li><li>CUSTOMER SERVICE: The lone server almost seemed annoyed to actually have to serve customers ( place was empty other than us).</li><li>SUMMARY: Food itself was pretty standard, but the sub-par service means I 'll be going somewhere else for my Pho fix next time.</li><li>Service is decent.</li><li>The food is not bad but I am giving it one star for obnoxious service because the server and owner hassled one of our party about sending back a dish.</li><li>The service level was subpar.</li><li>While the interior is n't bad, the food is n't anything special and the service is terrible.</li><li>Cons:- Bad service- Small quantity- Pho was sub-par- Appetizers were overpriced for the amount I would say it was the first, and last time I will be at this restaurant.</li><li>Crap service!</li><li>Why bother with mediocre food and horrible service!</li><li>The service was terrible.</li><li>However, due to the high turnover at this restaurant, the service is n't always the greatest.</li><li>Its always littered with loud mouthed teenagers, service is rude and slow and Ive found hair in my food more than once.</li><li>The service is crap here today for some reason.</li><li>Slowest service ever, like even in the middle of the night it takes 20 min to get through.</li><li>Not that I ever expect much from a fast food place, let alone a McDonalds, this place takes the cake for exceptionally poor service.</li><li>Really disappointed in the service.</li><li>Service is always fast and great.</li><li>Service was very quick, too, which is good when you 're on lunch break from work as I was.</li><li>The service was alright, most of the wait staff appear to be part time students, but with that said, they perform above what you 'd expect them to.</li><li>A place like this, you would n't be expecting top notch decor/ service.</li><li>Service was helpful and friendly but it was fleeting as we were seated in a private room at the back corner.</li><li>Excellent food, fantastic value nice quick service and very friendly atmosphere.</li><li>Service was very friendly, and the food came out VERY quickly, which was awesome.</li><li>Service is hard for people who does n't have English as their first language but I guess that 's to be expected.</li><li>Service is horrible.</li><li>The place was quite nice and service was really great.</li><li>The service was fast and they were all really really nice.</li><li>The only problem is they already add service fee to your bill, so what I have been doing in the post two years was inadvertently double tipping them, so beware.</li><li>Staff are nice but very busy so if you ask for something ( more water, drinks etc) just keep reminding them ( yes I know that 's not good service is all about but they do n't mind) ..</li><li>Great food, decent prices, nice atmosphere, super friendly service.</li><li>Service was indifference and cold .... but I got my food fast, hot and delicious ......... for all I care, that 's most important!</li><li>I never experienced customer service quite like this.</li><li>Excellent service and very delicious and flavourful food.</li><li>Service was poor, any time we need anything, menus, drinks, orders, etc it took a lifetime to wave the waitress down, considering the restaurant was so empty it should have been easy to get some attention but nope.</li><li>However even with the poor service, the food was very good and very well priced.</li><li>Service was efficient.</li><li>Everything was good and the service was so so, but a little slow.</li><li>The service is fast and the prices are really reasonable for this type of restaurant.</li><li>Service is good and free wifi is offered here as well.</li><li>Service: This is what 's driving the poor review and the fact that I am bothering to write one ( which is likely the reason most of the general public ever make one anyway).</li><li>Decor, space, and service were all amazing BUT the food was n't ( mind you this is dependent if you fancy Mongolian cuisine) I surprisingly found the curry fish to taste scrumptious but other items such as friend potato and noodles to be bland and in some cases very oily I would recommend this for someone craving traditional Chinese cuisine but if you are like me who enjoy Hakka style more I would avoid this place.</li><li>The service was very quick and efficient, which was exactly what we wanted, as hungry as we were.</li><li>Service is nice and prompt.</li><li>The service was quick and friendly.</li><li>Service: The staff is friendly and the owner is very down to earth.</li><li>Very good food and service here: the servers were All very attentive and helpful with recommending various choices on the menu.</li><li>I can at least say that the service was good, food came quick and we never had to wait to give the waiter our menu selections.</li><li>The servers are friendly and efficient and we had no issues with the service we received.</li><li>Service was fast and servers were nice.</li><li>They did n't have a website, so I decided to take a picture of every menu they owned!: P Everything tasted really good and the service is wonderfully friendly, I 'll be sure to come back here soon.</li><li>Very small, quaint and intimate atmosphere with friendly service.</li><li>The fish tastes fresh and service was great.</li><li>Service was lacking, as the servers kept missing some of our items, and they were n't as attentive to us ( maybe because we were such a large table ... but still!).</li><li>Service was good but overall I go out for sushi for sushi and this place just did not deliver.</li><li>Their service was excellent, the staff were patient and friendly.</li><li>They had good food and good service too But the hygiene level around you looks a bit questionable.</li><li>Service was excellent and servers are very friendly.</li><li>There is absolutely no customer service quality here if you are looking to come to a restaurant and pay to get annoyed defiantly try here !!</li><li>I always had horrendous service.</li><li>The service has never been anything but prompt and courteous, and the food is always fresh and delicious!</li><li>Not many people on a Monday ( 3 other tables) so we had great service and always came to refill our water.</li><li>Acceptable snd Good service.</li><li>Final remarks: Not a bad place for a cheap ayce, but do n't expect the service to be fantastic.</li><li>Service was attentive.</li><li>First time at Tekka Sushi, was very happy with the food, service and the environment.</li><li>The service was beyond amazing.</li><li>They do get one start off because the service was extremely extremely slow.</li><li>Very slow service.</li><li>Been here a few times and I have always been impressed by the speed of their service.</li><li>Service has been quick, especially during busy breakfast hours and cashiers are friendly.</li><li>I have been here many times and their food and service is great.</li><li>I ca n't rate on service or decor, as service is pretty non-existent.</li><li>I ca n't rate on service or decor, as service is pretty non-existent.</li><li>The food is great, the vegetarian options plentiful, the service friendly, the portions generous and the price is low.</li><li>Prices are good and the service is fair but get take out you do n't want to eat there.</li><li>My family has been going to Armenian Kitchen for probably 15 years -- since I was a kid and before I even lived in the city, but whenever we visited relatives down here, we 'd often meet at A. K. Service: We 've never once felt unwelcome.</li><li>The service has been fantastic every time.</li><li>Customer service can make or break an experience, and here it 's great.</li><li>It 's plenty of food and the service is better later in the evening with less patrons.</li><li>Service is welcoming Food extremely yummy.</li><li>The service is cheerful, if perhaps a little slow at times.</li><li>But warm atmosphere, super friendly and attentive service, and delicious eats made the experience great.</li><li>This is a favourite lunch place for locals- inexpensive, delicious, decent service.</li><li>The place is not fancy but the service is terrific.</li><li>Service was amazing, they checked on us multiple times without seeming to interrupt our conversation too many times.</li><li>Yum!- we had the fried eggplant and lamb which were good, but also the chicken schwarma which was rly dry and the flavors of the salad were meh- poor service, pricey- we saw the cook take pita off a pile of a customer 's leftover bread basket who had left, and put it in the pile to give to new customers: S.</li><li>Service was not good as the waitress decided that her shift had ended and made us pay for the food before we even got a chance to eat it.</li><li>The service was ok; the waiter was friendly but a little slow at times.</li><li>The service is ok, slow at times, but pretty consistent.</li><li>Be aware that service can be slow at times.</li><li>Nice service.</li><li>Cannot comment on the food as we had no service.</li><li>Less than one stat for service.</li><li>Service was odd and a bit awkward but they were pleasant people.</li><li>Service has never been bad.</li><li>The service was nice.</li><li>The service was okay.</li><li>This place can get very busy on Friday and Saturday nights, and service is not the best at times, but all that aside.</li><li>To be fair, we had a wonderful experience non-food-wise as the service was as everyone had reported: friendly and attentive.</li><li>Um ( clears throat) okay I 'm back .., always fresh, wonderful service.</li><li>The service was ok to slightly mediocre, but we were seated at the counter so we may not have had the best place for the best service.</li><li>The service was ok to slightly mediocre, but we were seated at the counter so we may not have had the best place for the best service.</li><li>Service could be better and the place could be less packed, but you ca n't control that sometimes.</li><li>Work across the street from Kiva 's- they have the best macaroons and treats!:) service is always very friendly.</li><li>Reasonable price, some times the service is shoty.</li><li>The service is really awful.</li><li>Service is efficient and friendly.</li><li>Food, service, ambience was average.</li><li>Heard great things about this place came by for Sunday brunch but was disappointed we ordered the eggs benedict the steak and eggs and a kids meal my eggs were blanched not post and vastly undercooked unfortunately the steak was a little salty and not perfectly consistent with the other orders we saw coming out by the end of everything with one extra orange juice the bill was close to $ 50 we waited for service and the wait staff seems he prioritizing Cutlery over bringing us additional copies and our bill not thrilled.</li><li>Great service !!!</li><li>I had the eggs benny and it was horrible, runny and bland sauce, bad and under cooked homefries with worse service.</li><li>Friendly and helpful service might be a little slow when busy.</li><li>Service is always friendly and efficient.</li><li>Great food, great service, not expensive.</li><li>Would be five stars if the service, and ambiance stepped up it 's game.</li><li>Service is on the slow side.</li><li>If you want horrible service, dirty environment and staff who do not care, this is a place for you.</li><li>The service was great and the food was okay, but we will likely not make the trek here again.</li><li>Was extremely disappointed with the service.</li><li>Great food, nice bottomless cup of coffee, really like the homefries and good service.</li><li>I would n't suggest the pancakes, not the best I 've had. ordered egg benedict with smoked salmon ( $ 9.99) and classic french toast ( $ 9.99) with sausage. very good food but service was a bit slow. nice environment and quiet. polite waitress.good for breakfast and brunch, a lot of couples were dining there.the hollandise sauce was a bit different from others ' diners, a little bit less sour and dense, but still we loved the taste!</li><li>The food, coffee, and service were adequate for the money, but seated at the back with so many people packed in I ca n't say it was exactly pleasant.</li><li>Service was not bad though.</li><li>SUMMARY: Aside from a questionable recommendation, service was good enough.</li><li>Since it was so busy, service was slow.</li><li>Service is HORRIBLE!</li><li>Amazing service from the server Nadia !!!</li><li>It was our second time here to watch a leafs game ( as they have booths with personal tvs), the service is HORRIBLE.</li><li>Restaurant: The Lobster Trap Cuisine: Seafood Location: North Toronto Address: 1962 Avenue Road Price Range: $ 25 and up 1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent Food: 3 Service: 4 Ambiance: 2 Overall: 3 Extra information:* Only open at dinner* Can choose your own lobster After having a taste of lobster from Maple Yip the other day, my dad was surprised to see us enjoy lobster so much.</li><li>But putting ambiance aside, the service is still as personable as ever and the food is still great.</li><li>Upon arrival the decor is very dated and tacky, everything looked dusty and unkempt but they had just opened for service so we decided to sit.</li><li>This was plop food on the table service.</li><li>Not `` I care if you have a good meal'' service.</li><li>Stay away from this restaurant you have been warned. it 'll be the first time and most likely the last time i 'll go there. i had high expectations of a place that has lobster in their name coupled with the fact that they are in one of the more higher end areas of the city. maybe that 's the downfall. from the outside, it looks like a place that you 'd find in a old strip mall, and the interior 's more of the same. when i saw that the food and wine menu were both laminated, i started to get an idea as to what i was getting myself into both pricewise and food quality. our server was not the most attentive to our needs even though we were a group of 12, and was noticibly pushing certain items on the menu. there were also a couple of kids with us and she was n't the most friendliest person with them, seemingly just focused on doin what she needed to do to make her coin and turning the table over. not that i find it wrong but it 's not something i 'd expect from a place that you 're paying up to $ 94 for a four pound lobster. me and my friend ordered garlic shrimps to start. they were of a decent size and flavour but were lacked presentation and quantity for what we paid. i 'm not really concerned with presentation that much on the regular but the plate they served it on made it look like we were n't getting a lot or we were missing something. we both ordered a 1lb lobster with baked potato and soup. we were informed that the french fries were not available which again i would n't expect from a place where you are paying so much for your meal. my soup was a new england clam chowder that was nothing special at all. the soup nutsy or even the marche had better. the baked potato was plain with just a small dollop of sour cream to consume it with. the final item to arrive was the lobster. i ordered for it to be broiled which it did but the ' stuff' ( cause i do n't really know what the heck they decided to put on it) just made it a very messy proposition to eat. it did n't really do much to enhance the enjoyment of the lobster, and it made me wonder was it really worth the coin i just dropped for this. the whole meal just tasted only just average. the whole experience was topped off when our bill came and our waitress almost made it a point to point out that the gratuity was not included in our bill. if you really want lobster, i would just say to go to red lobster and do it there. you 'd probably pay just the same but the service would definitely be better and so would the flavours !!</li><li>The service was a little slow but still ok.</li><li>Awesome service.</li><li>Decor is really ugly and service was slow.</li><li>Service is always friendly and they are rammed on Saturdays.</li><li>The place is definitely under-staffed and it 's definitely not the waiters and waitresses faults for not being up to par with service.</li><li>Me and my boyfriend had a fabulous time at Lobster Trap, it felt very homey and we had great service.</li><li>Excellent service and food.</li><li>Service is ok but they are not most attentive when it gets busy.</li><li>It was supposed to be a special occasion and both the food and service were not great.</li><li>SERVICE: overall the service was great, atmosphere was friendly and had a rustic vibe.</li><li>After we politely reminded her she was very apologetic and our drinks came promptly after that.* been to the other lobster trap and have to say this one is much better as far as service and quality of food* I will definitely be back as she was so kind to give us 50 $ off for next time!</li><li>Came on a Thursday night ... only two waiters and the service was extremely slow.</li><li>Super slow service and was not even offered water.</li><li>Due to the slow service, the waitress gave us complementary soups and pop which was nice- but dunno if that makes up for all the waiting.</li><li>For the six of us, with no alcohol, the bill came out to $ 300 before gratuities- quite expensive for the lack of service and atmosphere.</li><li>Verdict: At this price point, I would expect consistent food and better service.</li><li>Amazing service, outstanding food and comfortable atmosphere.</li><li>The staff is lovely and the service is flawless.</li><li>We went with my friend 's couple because they really liked the food and service last year.</li><li>The service was just terrible.</li><li>Needless to say, I did n't feel like leaving a tip for such terrible service and not feel bad about it.</li><li>I know seafood is expensive, but for the high price I 'm paying and the small portion I get, I expect some kind of uniqueness and exceptional quality in the food and good service from the servers.</li><li>Service was below average -- the waitress was trying to be nice and friendly but it seemed pretty fake.</li><li>Puzzled- as there seems to be other people complaining about service.</li><li>The bill, with tip, came to $ 340 which was outrageous for the quality of food we received and the horrible service.</li><li>So service can be a bit slow.</li><li>Service: Tania, the current owner, is lovely.</li><li>Service: 9/10 This is the Lobster Trap 's sole redeeming quality.</li><li>As it is a family owned business, my guess is the service is just as good as it was 35 years ago.</li><li>The service was wonderful also.</li><li>I could stand the poor decor and service when the food was good.</li><li>The service was friendly but they only had one waitress for the entire place.</li><li>Service is quick and friendly.</li><li>Service is decent and pho comes pretty quickly after ordering.</li><li>Great little place with just plain old good food and nice service.</li><li>Their english is adequate, but service is amazlingly prompt.</li><li>The pho here is great and the service is quick and friendly.</li><li>The place is clean, the service is good, and the food is tasty it 's definitely one of the better Vietnamese places in the area.</li><li>Service is fast.</li><li>Service is a little slow.</li><li>It 's a mom and pop place so the service is very friendly and makes you feel welcome.</li><li>It is also their weak point as they have to multi-task so the service is slower.</li><li>This takes some extra time ( a lot of people say that the service is slow), but it is soooooooo worth every hungry minute you wait!</li><li>The service here is fast, efficient and the services are friendly.</li><li>Service was quick.</li><li>Quick service but not exactly what you 'd call attentive.</li><li>Food came quickly ( congee arrived within minutes), and service was quick and courteous.</li><li>Upscale interior, average service, good hours.</li><li>Good food and fast service.</li><li>Service is average popular Chinese restaurant service.</li><li>Service is average popular Chinese restaurant service.</li><li>Congee Queen remains to be consistent in my books in terms of quality, price, and service.</li><li>The pictures on the menu are accurate to what the food looks like and it tastes great. hmm, i see a trend here. yet another `` chinese'' restaurant in my neighbourhood where we waited for ten-fifteen minutes with no server ( and this time we were one of two whole tables in the place). and again, i walked out. i 'd heard decent reviews from friends, never got a chance to see if the food was any good. smells great! poor/nonexistent service.</li><li>Staff are always friendly to us and go out of the way to serve us. consistently great chinese food. this restaurant and all their chains are extremely successful. theres always a lineup .. not sure if thats a good thing or bad thing but the food is great so that makes sense. the service is fast and efficient and take out is easy. ill alawys keep coming back here and their practically open all the time. great restaurant hours. the menu is vast and the assortment is amazing.</li><li>I really enjoyed the food here, but it was unfortunately not the greatest service.</li><li>The service is n't the friendliest, but it is really quick and efficient so I did n't mind at all that my waitress did n't bother with pleasantries and small talk.</li><li>Never again. got take out from here for mother 's day dinner. called at 6.15, they said our order would be ready in 35 minutes. when we got there, everything was ready- good timely service, even during dinner on a holiday. i was impressed with that. ca n't say the same for dine-in, as there were many people waiting to be seated. that 's to be expected though. the food was pretty good. got the seafood super bowl congee ( much smaller portion compared to dine-in), bbq sparerib with honey ( these were eh- i swear they tasted better last time), vegetable with mixed mushroom ( eh- not enough mushrooms imo), snow pea leaves ( not sure what it 's called on the menu, but these were pretty good). overall everything was pretty average. not sure if the food was a bit lower quality since there 's such a big rush of customers on mother 's day ? i 've come here a couple times before and the food was definitely better. i 'd still come back though and recommend this restaurant.</li><li>Prices are reasonable and the waiters/waitresses split tips so you can get good service from pretty much any employee.</li><li>When I go to a Chinese restaurant I do n't go for polite service I go for the quick service and hot food.</li><li>When I go to a Chinese restaurant I do n't go for polite service I go for the quick service and hot food.</li><li>This place seems to be able to even provide great customer service each time I go, and the staff always seem very friendly.</li><li>Service is quick and the foods are really reasonable prices and a lot to pick.</li><li>We ordered:- fried chili turnip cake -- strong garlic flavors but super tasty- pork and thousand year old egg congee -- super fast service; delicious comfort food- assorted BBQ meats ( honey roasted BBQ pork, roast duck, and roast pig) -- AMAZING!</li><li>I will be coming back for the food, but not for the service, very slow and we were ignored for much of the meal.</li><li>Service is quick.</li><li>Service was excellent even if I had to assemble the wrap myself.</li><li>I have been to this restaurant but did not try the take out service.</li><li>The service is pleasant which is distinctive.</li><li>Consistently top notch and fast service.</li><li>Are there any better that 's more convenient, with decent service and is somewhat adept in English ... probably not.</li><li>Food was good but i was disappointed with the customer service.</li><li>Quick service with prices ranging from $ 6 + congee medium-sized bowls to $ 11 + rice/noodle dishes.</li><li>Go for: cheap congee with fast parking, seating, and service Do n't go for: fanciness.</li><li>The only thing that bothered me was that the service was really short with us and sometimes a little bit confused.</li><li>Clean and efficient service.</li><li>Service is good.</li><li>Food: 4.5 stars Service: 3.75 stars Value: 4.5 stars Congee Queen is definitely one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in Toronto.</li><li>Apathetic service and tables that smell like rancid dish rags are the least of congee queen 's worries ( York Mills).</li><li>Not a good sign. one of my favorite restaurants. great price and service, top quality food. my favorite dishes are spice and pepper squid, fried turnips, tiger shrimp congee, and the roasted pork.</li><li>Customer service is not very good. really excellent food, large diverse menu, generous portions. will certainly be back.</li><li>Service is good.</li><li>A ton of servers means quick service.</li><li>WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER.</li><li>The service here was good and our server was kind enough to give us recommendations to get the most bang for our buck.</li><li>Service was good.</li><li>Food was good but service was horrible.</li><li>I do n't go to Chinese restaurants for the customer service or ambiance.</li><li>The place is clean, service is quick, and the food is excellent.</li><li>As with all the other Congee Queen locations, I 've experienced the same level of service and quality of food which is actually kinda impressive considering how many locations there are.</li><li>Obviously with most Chinese restaurants, you should n't expect the best service but overall Congee Queen is a-ok.</li><li>Service could be better.</li><li>The food can be plain &amp; the service is eh.</li><li>The service is fast ( once you get seated) and you do n't have one server as you just flag one down.</li><li>Large portions, good price, and fast and efficient service.</li><li>Wrong service.</li><li>Third, their place are clean but their service and their actual kitchen is bad bad very bad.</li><li>Their service is very quick and the food is placed on your table after a few minutes of ordering.</li><li>This place has the WORST service ever.</li><li>Great food, but DO NOT and I really emphasized this, DO NOT expect any service.</li><li>The service is deplorable however.</li><li>But be prepared to disappointed with the service.</li><li>Quick service, large portions, tasty dishes ( MSG) and cheap prices!</li><li>Great environment, and friendly service.</li><li>Service was n't particularly attentive, but that was understandable given how many people were dining at the time ( and how many were waiting).</li><li>Service was always typical Chinese restaurant quality/ but food was always good ...</li><li>Fast service, great food.</li><li>I like the restaurant itself because it 's very clean and modern but I ate there a few times and have gotten grimy looking glass and crappy service ....</li><li>However, I have never had any rude service here and we 've been coming here for the last 4 years!</li><li>Their service is really fast even though not that friendly, which I do not care about at a chinese restaurant.</li><li>The servings are pretty big, and the service is more friendly that China Town and just as fast, if not more quick.</li><li>The food and service has always been good, repeatedly, time after time.</li><li>The service is fast and efficient.</li><li>Overall, great food and service at this location.</li><li>Congee queen offers a great chinese food selection at great prices and quick service.</li><li>Service is ok- typical Asian service but they are quick and can turnover their tables quickly.</li><li>Service is ok- typical Asian service but they are quick and can turnover their tables quickly.</li><li>Service was not as good but still good ( did n't have high expectations due to how busy it was and where we were).</li><li>Service is super quick and attentive.</li><li>Huge portions and quick service.</li><li>Did I mention excellent service as well ?</li><li>Service is OK, not outstanding but never been bad.</li><li>Service is always fast and friendly.</li><li>It was fast service excellent food quality and cost was not high but affordable, good portions to share with family or friends.</li><li>So addivitviely good Service is quick place is clean and food is delicious.</li><li>However, the service is crappy, so be sure the waiter/waitress knows exactly what you want when you order.</li><li>I also ordered the Taiwanese sausage rice with tea egg ... the taste is pretty authentic. the service was slow but the waitresses were attentive.</li><li>Service is quite bad.</li><li>Service on the many times that I 've gone is decent and dishes come in a timely manner.</li><li>Also ca n't say that their service has ever been that great or welcoming.</li><li>The service seems to be inconsistent.</li><li>High-turnover and understaffing makes for forgetful and slow service.</li><li>The food is generally a little better here than the tea shop around, but not that good either. the service is not very satisfactory.</li><li>Only complaint is my coat was soaked with the frying smell after I got home. got the taro slush and milk custard toast and crispy chicken. both were really delicious, and the service and atmosphere here was nice. it was a little chilly though, not sure if it was just because today was super cold or if it was the tea shop. their menus are also adorable:) it was a great place and id definitely come back.</li><li>Really, there 's no complain so far but this does n't mean their service and all their food is 4 stars.</li><li>This restaurant is much smaller and service is a bit slow but that 's ok there were a lot of bubble tea take outers.</li><li>Service was good.</li><li>The servers were nice but as it got busier, service became poor and slow.</li><li>Service was a little slow since we were sitting in the corner table and not really visible, but nothing too horrifying happened this trip.</li><li>Their service is horrible.</li><li>Service is under average, no smile at all from any of the waitress.</li><li>However, the service is pretty awful here, the food is mediocre ( portions are quite small) and the price is INFLATED and definitely not worth the asking price for most drinks.</li><li>The service is crap ( honestly, I 'm sometimes ashamed to be chinese with so many chinese owned restaurants showing absolutely horrible service).</li><li>The service is crap ( honestly, I 'm sometimes ashamed to be chinese with so many chinese owned restaurants showing absolutely horrible service).</li><li>It is a trend for bubble tea restaurants to just have horrible service.</li><li>Now I said there were 3 main things to look for, ambiance, service and noise level but I 'd like to mention one other thing with Ten Ren.</li><li>Honestly, if you were to catch up with a friend or hang out with a group of friends, hit a cafe or a coffee shop where the prices are much lower and the service and environment are tenfolds better than places like here.</li><li>Service seemed good.</li><li>That shows me either the food is great, the service is great or both.</li><li>Did n't know they had a button we could push to get service.</li><li>A lot of Korean restaurants around Yonge and Finch are very good in terms of food but a bit snobby in terms of service.</li><li>Service was friendly and quick.</li><li>Service is excellent.</li><li>The pork belly was so so, and the chicken although tender and good quality, does not mix well with the spicy sauce The service was good considering that this place only has 1 server running around for all tables. although language is a bit of a barrier the server was nice and accommodating and you can tell she cares when suggesting you how to properly bbq the meat.</li><li>The service was not exceptional, but better than I was expecting for a Korean joint.</li><li>Service was very friendly and does n't really come by unless you ring the buzzer which I liked.</li><li>Indifferent service, below average food and paid parking ....</li><li>I love how they cook it in front of you, which just gives a warm feel of great service.</li><li>Service was prompt.</li><li>Service was very friendly and quick, I especially like how they leave a bottle of water at your table so you do n't have to constantly ask for a refill.</li><li>The service was great!</li><li>Service was friendly and the atmosphere was quite nice.</li><li>The server canme back with a Siracha in her hand and apologized stating the manager refused to give us the spicy sauce .... poor customer service in Asian restaurants are expected.</li><li>I know I 've been complaining about their service but still gave them a 3-star anyway, but I solely rate based on food quality since I believe a restaurant should n't suffer from getting crappy reviews because of the sloppy service from their workers.</li><li>I know I 've been complaining about their service but still gave them a 3-star anyway, but I solely rate based on food quality since I believe a restaurant should n't suffer from getting crappy reviews because of the sloppy service from their workers.</li><li>The service was ok, but the food was n't good at all.</li><li>Service was bad- I had to call for the waitress multiple times.</li><li>The service was quick and friendly.</li><li>The service there is pretty good too!</li><li>Decent food ( especially since there are no other dak galbi places in Toronto) but service is TERRIBLE and portions are tiny !!!</li><li>The only reason I still eat there despite its horrible service and selection of appetizer is because of their table cooking.</li><li>Service was a bit slow, and could 've given us a bit more than what we got.</li><li>Service lacked quite a bit as it was quite understaffed, with only two waitresses taking care of the full house restaurant on a Tuesday night.</li><li>Average food .. poor service !!!</li><li>Service was really nice and for 4 of us the bill came to about $ 45 CAD.</li><li>Pretty friendly service.</li><li>Yes I understand that it 's super busy, but still worry about the damn customer service.</li><li>In terms of service, the staff are very friendly overall unless it is really busy and hectic they are less attentive.</li><li>Service is always good here.</li><li>Service: 2.5 Service was very mediocre.</li><li>Service: 2.5 Service was very mediocre.</li><li>Considering that it was not a very busy night and it still took a while, i ca n't imagine the service when it is busy.</li><li>Dak galbi ( marinated chicken stir-fry on hot plate- traditionally dark meat chicken is used, but I do n't know what kind they use here) is their specialty but a la carte menu is offered too. banchan has the usual napa cabbage kimchi, beansprouts, but the one i especially like is their simple but good steamed broccoli with a dash of gochujang. personally i like gochujang with everything, but it may not be fore everyone. they also have a mashed potato banchan which i did not try. if your order the dak galbi, i recommend extra orders of tteok ( rice cake sticks), sweet potato and pumpkin. cheese ( looks and tastes like mozzarella) is offered too, giving it a fusion/modern twist. ramen is also on the menu. service is attentive, friendly and pleasant. quite a roomy restaurant, which is surprising if you merely look from the outside. unlike many other korean restaurants in toronto, you can actually linger here for a while, given enough seating for everyone. will DEFINITELY come again.</li><li>Service could be a bit quicker as we waited a good 20 minutes for our food to come.</li><li>We added noodles, cheese and rice cakes and it was yummy:) The spice is perfect, enough to clear your sinuses, but not sweat profusely from the heat: p The downside I can think of is that service is a bit slow and the add ons ( rice cakes, noodles, cheese, rice etc) are extra.</li><li>First of all, the service was slow to the extreme!</li><li>The place is very casual and the service is okay.</li><li>But definitely had a good experience with an average friendly service.</li><li>The service is kind of slow, but everyone is really nice.</li><li>The food was fantastic, the service could have been better.</li><li>Service: Usually adequate, they can rush you if it 's busy.</li><li>The servers were pleasant but service in general was a little slow.</li><li>However, the service could be better and the restaurant itself could be a lot cooler!</li><li>No complaints on service, speed of food, and quantity.</li><li>Hearty comfort food for me! n the mash potato side dish is so yummy too! towards the end when u only have a bit of chicken n pieces of veggies left in ur pan, you can ask them to make fried rice with it. they will bring over rice, hot sauce/sesame oil mixture n mix it all up for u. the owner lady even formed the rice into a heart shape for me n my boyfriend one time. it was too cute ~! the Dak Gal Bee is so good there, every time we go that 's all we get. so i do n't know how the other items on the menu taste. oh and the minimum order for Dak Gal Bee is 2 people portions. service is fine, waitresses are pleasant, but sometimes do n't speak much English, but who cares, food 's good!</li><li>Not a place to go for fancy decor or attentive service, but good if you want to grab a quick bite of authentic Korean food ( if you 've been to Korea: it 's like any of the millions of low-end diners around, which is n't a bad thing).</li><li>The service there sometimes very good and sometimes its very bad.</li><li>The service is not that good.</li><li>The service is very fast.</li><li>With only two waiters rushing around the whole place, I 'm actually really impressed with the level of service.</li><li>Service is good enough and pretty fast.</li><li>The first thing I noticed was how quick the service was, which is great.</li><li>Great food, great service.</li><li>Loved the hot pot, great service, value for money, meat was good quality.</li><li>The service, while a bit understaffed when we went, was quite courteous and helpful, better than most hotpot places I have been to.</li><li>Great service, selection and price.</li><li>It was so impressive ( and rare) to see such efficient service that was attentive and caring.</li><li>For once I encounter a hotpot place that has great customer service!</li><li>The service was easily the best part about this place.</li><li>The service is quick and attentive.</li><li>+ Good service and food comes quick.</li><li>TL; DR:

again ...</li><li>And their service is horrible, as specially the girl at cashier, i thought Japanese usually provide better customer service ? but might try them again ...</li><li>Good portion with very reasonable price, friendly staffs and fast service.</li><li>I like free delivery service.</li><li>I 'd say come here for the quantity not really quality or service.</li><li>It is extremely rare for me to rate an establishment two star simply based on a service alone- however time after time visiting this establishment, I decided to say enough is enough ..</li><li>Let 's just say that this is your typical ' successful' take out place that makes you think that your patronage does not seem to worth their slightest effort to provide you with a decent service.</li><li>Let me elaborate Take out service: Even if you had called in advance and make your order- this place would not prepare your order until you arrive and pay ( cash only of course).</li><li>The prices here are real cheap and the quality of service is great.</li><li>They are super fast and efficient but the service can be questionable.</li><li>The service is quick and the food is decent with good sized portions.</li><li>Service is quick and they charge extra for everything to keep prices good I suppose.</li><li>Food: 4/5 Value: 5/5 Atmosphere: 3/5 ( must do take out) Service: 5/5 Sushi is delicious and the takeout is insanely quick.</li><li>It 's a small place with no gimmicks, but the service is fast and the fish quality is really great.</li><li>Definitely not a sit-down restaurant as the space is limited but this place is more about good price and speedy service.</li><li>If you 're planning to eat in the restaurant be prepared to get no service.</li><li>The service is really fast; I usually wait less than 5 minutes for my roll.</li><li>Really really really bad service.</li><li>Service is pretty fast and the staff are friendly.</li><li>The service was quick; I waited much less than 10 minutes to receive my order.</li><li>Service was good, nothing special.</li><li>I do n't recommend sitting down, as basically you get no service .. but sometimes if you live far and are hungry .. there is no other choice!</li><li>Their rice is amazing, fish fresh, their fish: rice is as it should be and their service is so abrupt and rude that is it somewhat amusing and makes for good lunch time conversation if you are stuck for discussion topics with your companion.</li><li>Other than that, service was great, food was filling and worth the price.</li><li>The service is n't that great but the food overlooks it.</li><li>The service is friendly, food is delicious with huge portions, and the price is great.</li><li>I ordered the Small Party tray and it had a good amount of variety and service was really fast.</li><li>This place has by far the worse service.</li><li>Calling it `` service'' would do the word dishonour.</li><li>The place would receive 5 stars if it were n't for the absolutely rude service.</li><li>Best dynamite rolls ever! filling and delicious and quick service even though its always packed with take outs !!</li><li>The place is extremely small and the service is decent.</li><li>The spicy salmon was amazing ... first of all, the service was incredibly fast and the price was great ( $ 6.20 for 8 pieces).</li><li>Fresh fish and good service ...</li><li>Anyways, I have been eating here for almost 4 years now and I am never disappointed with their speed of service and quantity.</li><li>Service is a little brusque.</li><li>Service is horrible, for get about servers handing you menus; they are tosses on the the table.</li><li>This is your answer Hand made and pulled noodles with a wide variety of options to serve all tasted Pretty much every bowl is under ten bucks so not a tough decision to make However there is only seating for 14 customers so it 's a bit of a bolt hole but worth the wait to grab a seat Great service and great food My dish had wide flat noodles and had the right amount of chew to them and it 's a huge portion All ingredients were fresh and it felt odd I was the only gaijin in the place where the waitress kept trying to explain to me how to eat ..... no I know chopsticks yeah h-mart yes noodles .... hahaha.</li><li>I think there is definitely room for improvement with staff and service and I do agree with the comments that the staff 's English is very basic.</li><li>Service: Do NOT let the service put you off!</li><li>Service: Do NOT let the service put you off!</li><li>The staff is friendly and the service is not bad at all.</li><li>Food is good and so is the service.</li><li>Server were really friendly, quick service!</li><li>Overall the food I 'd give a 3 star but coupled with service i have you give a one star.</li><li>Service is big for me and leaning right over my meal to talk to me was n't cool.</li><li>Their service is not good.</li><li>Service was good but as I said above, I wish there was more of an explanation on which noodles to choose.</li><li>Service standards of any fast food styled dine in restaurant are without a doubt forgiving and usually a compromise when considering the added benefits of timeliness.</li><li>WORST service EVER !!!</li><li>Seriously, the service is CRAP.</li><li>My sister wants to give them the chance to bring our food out but by this point, I am so pissed off by how terrible the service is that I get up from my chair and walk out.</li><li>Overall the food is just average by service is n't that great.</li><li>Service: No complaints.</li><li>Small place, service good and prompt.</li><li>The service was also unimpressive, the servers never came by to fill up water or ask if everything was alright.</li><li>The food and service were both good.</li><li>Have to mention their service, it 's the finest among all Chinese restaurants I 've been.</li><li>The restaurant is very nice though and service was above average.</li><li>The food quality is great as well as the service!</li><li>There were plenty of waitstaff around so service was prompt.</li><li>Service can be slow here when the place is busy, but during off-peak hours service is fast.</li><li>Service can be slow here when the place is busy, but during off-peak hours service is fast.</li><li>Service here was average but it was a busy day so I

horrible.</li><li>Service is average- nothing amazing.</li><li>But if you 're going for the dining experience and looking for top-notch, attentive service, this is not the place for you.</li><li>The service was pretty good, considering it was a larger group.</li><li>The service is horrible and the food is even worse.</li><li>Service is good and fast.</li><li>Their menu caters to most people 's palettes, the clean decor and decent service definitely helps in securing it as a `` safe'' restaurant to hold a gathering.</li><li>Once the food came, 1.5 hours after we arrived, it was really good, but the service was so horrible.</li><li>The second time I went, I actually warned my friend about the service, but we decided to give it a try anyway.</li><li>But the horrible service has ensured that I will never go back.</li><li>The service is usually efficient, the ambiance is modern and the restaurant is physically clean.</li><li>Service was good.</li><li>Service is good, the staff is very friendly.</li><li>The service is very good and the food also.</li><li>I 've eaten in a number of times and service is always friendly and quick.</li><li>The service is great and the quality of food is unbelievable.</li><li>It also has a nicer layout than most Starbucks, with a roomier service area large seating area that 's more secluded from the normal counter service and entry areas, yet still provides a nice ambience with cozy chairs right by the window.</li><li>It also has a nicer layout than most Starbucks, with a roomier service area large seating area that 's more secluded from the normal counter service and entry areas, yet still provides a nice ambience with cozy chairs right by the window.</li><li>However, I 've never been to a place with SUCH SLOW service.</li><li>The service was slow and my waiter was rushed.</li><li>We had about 30 people in the party so we expected that service might be a tad slow but understandable.</li><li>The service at this location, while friendly, I find can be a bit slow- even if it 's not too terribly busy.</li><li>3* for average deli style food and negative 5* for the nasty service at the take out counter.</li><li>New design Same old tasteless food Service is weak but it matches the quality of the food.</li><li>The service is only average ...</li><li>Food 's usually decent though and same for the service.</li><li>The staff was friendly, but the service is seriously lacking.</li><li>Always good food and service at pickle barrel Leslie.</li><li>From this experience I would come back sooner rather then later and hope to get the same service again!</li><li>The service was pleasant, although it did take a few minutes to be seated ( with very few diners).</li><li>Terrible service.</li><li>Service is nice and consistent.</li><li>Service is extremely slow.</li><li>Antonio, as a manager you should apologize for your staff not being prompt with service.</li><li>Service was terribly slow !!</li><li>It is impossible for the wait staff to see anybody, and the service has become lackluster.</li><li>Since this is a neighborhood restaurant, we have eaten there often, but the last 3 times the service was poor and the food so so.</li><li>The only reason I come is that the food is `` reasonably'' -priced and they have some healthy options but the general quality of service and food is sub par.</li><li>It 's actually quite surprising to me that they still have such a big loyal fan base, since this location is notorious for bad service, perhaps it 's due to tradition and habit and it 's quite a family friendly restaurant.</li><li>This past Dec 20 I had lunch with friends and the service was terrible.</li><li>Bad service can really ruin your dining experience.</li><li>Service is great in the morning.</li><li>Came for dinner, lots of empty seats but service was still slow.</li><li>Overall the service is pretty lousy because the staff is too busy doing nothing and wasting customers time.</li><li>Poor service, UNBELIEVABLY POOR FOOD ( if you can even call it that).</li><li>Disgusting customer service from both the manager at the restaurant, as well as from head office.</li><li>The service still diminishes it back to 1 star.</li><li>When I came here the first few times with friends and family, I had thought that maybe we were just unlucky for bad service and food.</li><li>When we got the bill, obviously we did not leave any generous tip, because of the poor service.</li><li>She asked ' was the service not good', and we said yes the service was not good, they took forever to take our order, the food came cold, they do n't come and check if everything is ok after they bring their food.</li><li>She asked ' was the service not good', and we said yes the

thing, poor service and one time this lady was just really straight out annoying.</li><li>The place is clean &amp; the service was efficient.</li><li>Servers do not know what customer service is .... our server came up piped there head in and said I 'll be with you in a minute `` not a hello how are you, my apologies you have been waiting for me to come by for 10 minutes.</li><li>Came again, and had great service again.</li><li>This place has the worse service ever!</li><li>Service is friendly although it could be a little quicker.</li><li>I 've been going to this location for over 10 years now and while it started out excellent both the food and service have declined dramatically over the last few years.</li><li>The service was to was also not bad, had reservations and was seated immediately.</li><li>We had a really nice meal and the service was pretty good since one server sticked to us the entire time.</li><li>What really did not impress me was that the service was very poor.</li><li>In addition, the service was overall poor in that they did not serve the soup as most chinese restaurants would or take away done dishes in a timely manner.</li><li>Never dissappointed, service can be hit and miss with duck being served before the pancakes and green onion and cucumber being served sparingly.</li><li>Service was slow and inconsistent.</li><li>I agree with other reviewers that the service is not this place 's best attribute, yet the staff is still quite friendly.</li><li>I have been here quite a few times now, the food is reasonably good, the service if you dine in can be fairly slow and the atmosphere of the restaurant is n't t as relaxing as it could be due to the decor, like walking into a 70 's movie ..</li><li>Service was decent.</li><li>It 's not fine dining and the service is off and on, but I hope Peking Man will stick around for my children to enjoy as well.</li><li>The place has always been very reasonable with its quality and service.</li><li>Service terrible.</li><li>But with the food and service as such, I 'd take my family out to better Chinese restaurants in town.</li><li>The service is average as there may be lots of customers there.</li><li>Service was decent, the food was a little bland.</li><li>Unfortunately, the service we had ruined our experience.</li><li>The service is generally decent, although there was a moment of laziness ( you 're not going to set my side of my table cuz you could n't reach over ?).</li><li>But seating is spacious and comfy as the place is huge and service was friendly.</li><li>The service is rather slow, but they never attempt to rush you to leave, so this was a great place to relax and socialize in the comfy chairs, as long as you do n't look too carefully at the wallpaper ...</li><li>The service was decent.</li><li>I did n't give One star just because of the food, it 's the whole combination, the decor, service etc ...</li><li>FYI: BBQ duck $ 43 ( $ 36: sliced duck with crepes $ 7: stir fried duck with lettuce) I felt really bad for my friends because I 've been here before with my in laws and it was pretty good back then ( a year ago .. i think) prompt service and excellent food.</li><li>Ya the decor has n't changed, dusty x- mas lights, mix matched wall papers, I did n't mind at all since the food was great! and with awesome service !!</li><li>In terms of service, we were the only one in the restaurant but the service was extremely slow.</li><li>In terms of service, we were the only one in the restaurant but the service was extremely slow.</li><li>Overall, that was a very disappointing experience and I was literally so pissed at this place- for the food and the service.</li><li>I seriously have better food and better service for a lower price at Manchu wok.</li><li>The service was also very poor.</li><li>The service is n't always great, but the food does make up for it.</li><li>The service is slow and the decor is delightfully/wildly tacky, but I seriously drive from Etobicoke to have the Shanghai fried noodles and General Tso Chicken.</li><li>The service is good and they have a good mix of clientele that were there so it 's not a pure Chinese only type place if you know what I mean.</li><li>Their service has been quick all 3 times I 've been.</li><li>Consistency in service and food quality is key to a successful business.</li><li>We had a delicious meal, the concept is refreshing, and the service was great.</li><li>Service is very sketchy ...</li><li>Via Cibo is a favourite among my coworkers and I as a lunch spot for it 's fast service and reasonably priced but very delicious Italian food.</li><li>The service is usually pleasant although not very attentive once you 're seated, which makes sense as they are not a conventional sit-down restaurant.</li><li>Food is great, but service leaves much to be desired for the cost.</li><li>It 's too bad this place ca n't find a rhythm, the food is incredible but the overall rushed feeling combined with delayed service is not worth the price.</li><li>The service is also friendly, welcoming, and unpretentious.</li><li>I really liked this place- awesome service, modern decor and yummy food.</li><li>Food: 5/5 Ambience: 4/5 Service: 5/5 Cleanliness: 4/5.</li><li>In total with a cappuccino my bill was $ 20.35 which for me is steep for the service and amount of food.</li><li>Via Cibo would have received a higher review if I were not factoring in the service and operation of the establishment.</li><li>Her usual style is to tip based on the service, and as she stated, `` But no one has served me yet.''</li><li>Prices are amazing- service was great.</li><li>Good service, good food.</li><li>The low number of stars is regarding customer service, not the quality of food.</li><li>This place would get 4 stars if the service was a bit better and they had more veg options.</li><li>For the price of sit down dining, the ambience is sparse and service pedestrian.</li><li>Fast service, food arrived in 5 min. Cons The traffic on Leslie and York Mills is really busy on a Fri night, so plan extra travel time to get here.</li><li>Pretty good food, poor unattentive service.</li><li>Service is fantastic, and the food is consistently good ( and reasonably priced).</li><li>The service is poor.</li><li>The service is also good good good!</li><li>Made me feel as though I was in a fast food joint but had the elegance of service at the table.</li><li>Restaurant: Oh Geul Bo Geul Cuisine: Korean Location: North York Address: 5320 Yonge St Price Range: $ 10 ~ 1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent Food: 4 Service: 3.5 Ambiance: 3 Overall: 3.5 Extra information:* Open late* Patio in the back for Korean BBQ* Serves lunch &amp; dinner Oh Geul Bo Geul is a Korean restaurant that is somewhat hard to notice even with their bright yellow store front sign.</li><li>I should have listened to Yelp reviews of bad service and mediocre food, because I, unfortunately, experienced it first hand.</li><li>I do n't think service really matters as long as I get my food and it 's good.</li><li>Really, I had to resist the urge to confront her over such a petty thing and inform her that tipping is in fact NOT MANDATORY and the money is supposed to go to the SERVERS, as well as tipping is usually dependent on the SATISFACTION of service and food.</li><li>The warnings of awful service do seem to be indeed true, do heed the warnings.</li><li>The service at this place was great though, the ladies are friendly and I would definitely give this place another chance and try something else.</li><li>In terms of service, they just sat me down with some tea and more or less left me alone at that point but came right over as soon as I flagged someone down.</li><li>The service sucks.</li><li>Service: Prompt and reasonable until the moment they process your transaction.</li><li>I 've never had a bad meal or poor service here.</li><li>Just, just, do n't get me started on their service.</li><li>I have been here many times but it 's a gamble each time whether or not I will receive good service and decent food.</li><li>On many occasions they are short staffed and there is a tendency for bad service.</li><li>The worse service I have ever experienced.</li><li>My sister told her that it was because the service that we received did not deserve the typical 15% tip, they were lucky that they even got the 10%.</li><li>The service and food here is inconsistent, but I am a sucker for their pancakes and banchans- particularly their kimchi cumcumbers, seaweed salad, chap chae noodles, and soy beans.</li><li>Definitely enjoyed my experience the second time around and the service was slightly better, except for the lack of tea refills !!</li><li>Service can be a little slow.</li><li>FYI we were nothing polite to them the whole time, their customer service was just that appalling.</li><li>The food is decent, the service is decent, parking is considered good for Yonge st. Overall acceptable.</li><li>Do n't expect `` western-style'' service- the people there are sweet, just rushed!</li><li>Family-style, tasty and good service ( even when they 're busy).</li><li>Lots of side dishes and ' service' ( free dish on the house).</li><li>Service is very friendly.</li><li>Food deserve better ratings, but service is terrible.</li><li>Service here is homey!</li><li>Service was hit and miss, after dropping off our food it was near impossible to flag down anyone for more appetizers and lettuce ( even with the cool buzzer system).</li><li>The quality of the main dishes and the service that came with it were passable.</li><li>The service has ALWAYS been bad ... like, you feel you 're inconveniencing them when trying to get your order in or to ask for the bill- bad ... but it was tolerable back when the food was pretty good, for a reasonable price.</li><li>Anyways, for the prices they 're trying to charge and the service you get, there are many waaay better korean restaurants to go to.</li><li>Two stars for service.</li><li>The rice cakes were a perfect amount of spicyness but did n't have enough fish cake in it: ( Service was kind of slow, but I went for lunch on a weekend so it was busy.</li><li>Food: 7/10 -- Value: 8/10 -- Service: 7/10 -- Ambiance/Décor: 7/10 There is n't much to say about this place.</li><li>Service is fine and the servers are nice.</li><li>Service was a little bit `` meh.''</li><li>As with most Korean restaurants the service is so-so.</li><li>The noodles were a bit chewier than I expected, but overall the food was decent as well as the service.</li><li>Service 4/5- Good service, very attentive.</li><li>It can get crowded, but service is usually quick and servers are attentive, as long as you flag them down.</li><li>The food was fine but the service was terrible, like you would n't believe.</li><li>We had to ask million times for menu, tea, water, bill etc. we were very unhappy about the service and left a small tip.</li><li>We explained why we were not happy with the service.</li><li>The service here ....</li><li>I have a lot of patience for slow service in these sorts of family owned joints ( see my Ottoogi review), but this was a bit much.</li><li>Service is however extremely slow, or negligent to the point where nobody would bring us our bill after 15-20 minutes of asking ( we asked two different ladies and both said yes, and never came back).</li><li>I 'd say the only downfall is the cleanliness and speed of service.</li><li>So now that I 've finished my ranting and raving about the side dishes ( namely the pancake), onwards with a review of the actual food from the menu, pricing and service.</li><li>Customer service could use some work.</li><li>So, service is usually a little slow, where the two ajummas wo n't come hustling to your table when you press the button.</li><li>The service here was odd as one server looked as though she wanted us out as quickly as possible, while the other treated us as if we were celebrities.</li><li>The staff is very `` cool'', as in really stern and sometimes rushes you to order things but they 're friendly overall. the food served here tastes awful. the place is also pretty much a dump. the service is quite slow.</li><li>I 'm not sure why i went here again for the second time as both were equally disappointing experiences. extremely racist restaurant with poor service Even the old Korean lady yelled people in Chinese about some racist comments!</li><li>Service could be better.</li><li>Their service is good and you always get many free yummy appetizers!</li><li>Their hot pot broths are good do n't get me wrong but the service needs alot of work and the other dishes that we ordered were n't so good .. had to ask for water and tea so many times cause they kept forgetting and when I went to go pay the bill I gave a TIP that I thought they deserve but the lady chased me and said your have to TIP 10% of the bill ..</li><li>I was in shocked .. they need to know that tipping is what the customer thinks the restaurant or the service deserves ..</li><li>Service: I do n't get what people are saying about bad service ??</li><li>Service: I do n't get what people are saying about bad service ??</li><li>Came by for lunch on my last day in toronto and the food is good but service is sparse if not non-existent.</li><li>You ca n't expect service or cleaniness to be like a 5 star restaurant.</li><li>The service is alright, but isnt the greatest but this could be because of the language barrier.</li><li>** WORST SERVICE YOU CAN EVER GET!</li><li>Good thing there was the service call button on the side of the wall, so we just kept ringing it until someone came to our table.</li><li>* Overall, I WOULD NEVER come back, food is average but SERVICE IS TERRIBLE AND STAFF ARE UNFRIENDLY !!</li><li>As said by many others the service can be really hit or miss, they are often forgetful and sometimes unresponsive, but when they are having a good day its not too bad however they are usually nicer to their korean patrons.</li><li>This place has excellent gamjatang and better service than Nakwon ( which has great food but poor service).</li><li>This place has excellent gamjatang and better service than Nakwon ( which has great food but poor service).</li><li>Although the food was okay, the service was not and it was absolutely the worst service I 've ever experienced.</li><li>Although the food was okay, the service was not and it was absolutely the worst service I 've ever experienced.</li><li>In short, do n't come here if you 're looking for at least mediocre service or is planning to give less than 15% tips.</li><li>I have been seated in their basement a few times during busy periods but was still able to get service on a timely basis.</li><li>We all know when you go to an Asian place, do NOT expect too much of their service!</li><li>We come for its free 10-side-dish, affordable main dish, and quick service.</li><li>The service here is terribly slow.</li><li>Service: 3/5, typical service- nothing surprising but nice staff overall.</li><li>Service: 3/5, typical service- nothing surprising but nice staff overall.</li><li>To beat the rush and you can get better service.</li><li>However, I only give them 1 star because we experienced very bad service.</li><li>Service was so-so.</li><li>As many other people on Yelp have already alluded to, service is lacking and the waitress were, I hate to say it, but downright rude.</li><li>With so many options in the area with good food and nice service, we will not be back or getting take-out from this restaurant again.</li><li>Delicious food, okay service.</li><li>The service is so so.</li><li>The chicken came hot and quickly, service was great overall.</li><li>Too much food for me hahaha the service is good.</li><li>The service was meh but was seriously overshadowed by how crispy and juicy their fried chicken was.</li><li>Location, amount compared to the price, quality of the food, service, everything is 5 stars but only reason I chose to give 4 stars is due the fact the food is a bit too salty- with beer = perfect.</li><li>This place is also notorious for the bad service!</li><li>Therefore come for great Fried Chicken and Zero service!</li><li>Service is a bit slow though.</li><li>Been here several times, and starting from the overall service, which is always super friendly, makes it a highlight for every visit, regardless if we had two people or six people.</li><li>The service was slow and not attentive.</li><li>In overall, I still go often and you wont regret, but I put 3 instead of 4 stars hoping they improve their service consistency.</li><li>Now the service ....</li><li>I will recommend you to forget about the service.</li><li>I 'll love to give them 4 stars for the food but because of their lack in service and few other complains, I 'll give them 3.8.</li><li>Service is quick and the staff are quite friendly.</li><li>Great service especially if you bring a Korean-speaking friend.</li><li>I 'm quite disappointed and not happy with the service.</li><li>The service was super quick and friendly.</li><li>Also good service.</li><li>Love the green onion chicken but their service can be better.</li><li>My order of delivery comes from this pizza hut, and I have been always satisfied with service and quality.</li><li>Anyways, the pizza is like any other pizza hut but I just do n't recommend coming here just because I can get better service at a pizza hut else where.</li><li>Service: I had to give the lady at the counter my name three times before she got it.</li><li>I called customer service and they filed a complaint to this store and said I should be receiving a call from the manager.</li><li>This store is just so rude and knows absolutely nothing about customer service.</li><li>The service is friendly enough.</li><li>Great transformation in terms of service been here after a long time.</li><li>But today the service was really good.</li><li>I got chicken biryani and there was lamb pieces as well when i dont even eat lamb so i didnt eat and the prices are ridiculously high and the service is very poor.</li><li>That 's where the first two stars went- service and wait time.</li><li>Lines are fast and service is friendly.</li><li>Service was slow, but they gave extra minion toys, even though they were n't the ones I wanted.</li><li>Very good service.</li><li>The service is very bad at this restaurant.</li><li>Service is slow and I am left waiting for my food.</li><li>It 's not as crowded as other similar restaurants and service is the usual fare for Chinese restaurants- fast and straight to the point.</li><li>The food is good but there just too rude bad service good food I would go back only for the food and Ima get the hell outta there.</li><li>Service is always exceptional and the family who owns this restaurant eat there, which is always a good sign.</li><li>Service is bad ( for takeout), and the people are n't very nice.</li><li>The service was no-nonsense and low-maintenance but completely efficient and the older woman who served us clearly knew the menu backwards and forwards and inside out.</li><li>Great service!</li><li>Very friendly service &amp; extremely large portions.</li><li>Service is exceptional, staff clearly love working here.</li><li>Have been here many times, friendly service and big portions.</li><li>Along with our dessert, we both had ordered drinks in hopes that they would make super cool latte art as last time, E received a Totoro latte art in her hot chocolate when she came here Sadly, we did n't get any super intense latte art for our drinks, but the service was great and we had a good time there.</li><li>Pretty good service, parking is annoying here though on a busy Saturday night, crepes are fresh, they are not really pipping hot when they come though.</li><li>Service was very attentive, but never intrusive to conversation.</li><li>Glasses were filled promtly ( my main indicator of good service since I am a fish who needs her water).</li><li>The service was pretty fast considering the place was full.</li><li>Service was prompt and friendly.</li><li>Needless to say, after that experience, sometimes I wake up thinking about the taste of pastels whipped cream-_- Service is great and food/drinks are so good !!</li><li>The service is quick and everyone is very friendly.</li><li>Latte is always great Service is decent Cons: Can get very busy depending on the time Very small space One washroom.</li><li>Service was good too.</li><li>Service: Our waitress ( who also worked behind the counter) was sweet and generally efficient on a busy Friday night.</li><li>However, I mainly wanted to write this review for the service, because it was simply amazing and definitely added a lot to the overall experience.</li><li>Pastel Creperie has unbelievably great service, with decent desserts and drinks.</li><li>All in all this place is small and gets busy quick but service is great, friendly and fast.</li><li>Service- When we arrived, no one came to greet us instead 4 servers were just hanging out behind the counter and yelled out sit wherever and when we choose our spot they said `` not there'' ( because we needed to be at least 3 persons) and then my friend pointed out a group of 2 who were sitting at a 3-4 person table and her excuse was to blubber no and forced us to sit in between two busy ( and might I add super tight) tables.</li><li>I am going to warn my friends NOT to go here cuz honestly, their customer service was unprofessional and their food was not measurable to a delicious crepe dessert.</li><li>Clean and service is good.</li><li>It 's small, not too many tables, but the service was good.</li><li>We all enjoyed it and service was pleasant.</li><li>Atmosphere and service is good.</li><li>Long story short: Service took a long time, one of the girls acknowledged my raised hand but never came back to help me get the bill.</li><li>The staff is attentive, polite, and service and food came fast.</li><li>Really great presentation and good service too.</li><li>Service was quick, they brought over some water and menus.</li><li>The service is great, the waitresses are friendly.</li><li>Service: No problems.</li><li>Although the place was small and busy, the service was attentive and we did n't feel rushed to leave.</li><li>The service was amazing.</li><li>Overall everything about this joint, price, service and desserts were amazing and it is a hidden gem in the GTA.</li><li>Also, their service is great.</li><li>I came quite early in the day, so service was extremely fast.</li><li>Lots of selection for crêpes and service is not too slow either.</li><li>I would give this place 2 thumbs up with great service as well!</li><li>The service was casual but friendly.</li><li>Service was meh, there were a few times when we saw the servers chatting, and it was only when I raised my hand that our server came over to us.</li><li>Their dessert crepes are pretty decent but their service is WORST TO NONE !!!!!</li><li>I recommend going there on weekdays because they have a lunch special: ( savoury or desert crepes with a latte for only around 10.99 + salad) Service is always good, and the food is even better.</li><li>The service is always fast, friendly and pleasant!</li><li>Service is great, and the atmosphere is very relaxing.</li><li>Service was slow and a bit absent-minded ( forgot half our order), but it could 've been one of those `` off nights''.</li><li>We got water and menus quickly so service was pretty good I 'd say.</li><li>Nice and clean, though the decor is confusing ( christmas garlands with nutcrackers and fake summer flowers ?) anyway, the service is great, the girl is always standing waiting to serve you, though she did n't understand my question when i asked what type of cakes they have.</li><li>Space is limited and a little tight for the average person .. = P We ended up ordering crepes, matcha tea and another special tea that you do n't normally see elsewhere ... we were overall very impressed with the service and food quality ..</li><li>Service was also very good, the ladies who work there are nice and polite.</li><li>What impresses me most is the customer service.</li><li>Presentation and service was great but being a Tuesday afternoon it was pretty dead inside so great service is to be expected.</li><li>Presentation and service was great but being a Tuesday afternoon it was pretty dead inside so great service is to be

excellent.</li><li>The service was nice and friendly.</li><li>Love the attentive service and the cozy ambience too.</li><li>Great service.</li><li>Latte art was pretty awesome, and service was also great!</li><li>Super friendly service, nice ambience, reasonable price.</li><li>The very first thing that I have to mention is their EXCELLENT level of service and degree of attentiveness.* appreciative applaud* The waiters would check up on you every now and then to make sure you 're doing okay with everything.</li><li>This place is so cute .... and great little desserts as well, I have n't had anything savoury but go have a coffee and ice cream:) Its wonderful and great service !!!</li><li>Service was very good and the waitress checked on us frequently.</li><li>Their crepes are perfectly cooked and they have many sweet and also gourmet crepe options. service was amazing.</li><li>The service is good and someone always comes by periodically to refill my water.</li><li>The food and drinks were great and so was the service.</li><li>Service is accomodating and friendly!</li><li>Although the store is quite small, the service and food is excellent.</li><li>The service is good and fast ..</li><li>Service was prompt and good.</li><li>My server looked as if she hated her job as well so her customer service was n't exactly the standard but another server who also helped me out was genuine.</li><li>The service was super friendly, and based on this first experience, I 'm excited to try the desert crepes at some point in time as well.</li><li>Their service was good, refilled our waters.</li><li>Service: decent. attentive. willing to split bills.</li><li>Service is also good.</li><li>The service was good the people were friendly and talkative and this waiter gave us opinion on which cake to get since we were torn between the pistachio cheesecake and the pistachio buttercream.</li><li>I love the brother and Sister partnership and they provide very good service and suggestions.</li><li>I will say it is one of the very few places that can provide you a good quality of food, service at down town feel.</li><li>I would give 0 stars if the application allows for it, avoid this place at all costs, many other pizza joints literally down the road, pizzaiollo and pizza pizza, along others, with way better customer service and food.</li><li>Vietnamese restaurants are known for efficient service but this one has gone overboard.</li><li>Service is as expected for an asian place, not very personal, the servers are just focused on bringing you your food and then you eat and you 're out.</li><li>Pho ( rare beef pho) is not too oily compared to some other Vietnamese restaurants.-: Service is not good.</li><li>The owner is n't too chatty/friendly but the service is ok.</li><li>Nothing upscale or fancy about the decor or service, but it 's the food that 's good.</li><li>Very busy, service is quick.</li><li>Good food but service leaves something to be desired ....</li><li>We had clearly asked for a new table, and there were empty seats on other half of the restaurant, but waitress plainly said no.- now the food: we were praying that food would be amazing cuz we were so hungry that we would just let go of poor service if food was good.</li><li>Service can be a dud sometimes but it 's a minor setback when it comes with good and cheap food.</li><li>Well, I must say that sometimes their service can come across as rude.</li><li>They take orders quickly and food comes quick but service is n't really pleasant.</li><li>The pho and seafood congee is good ( the only items I order), but they completely lack customer service.</li><li>One of my friends I went with also had bad customer service experiences with the SAME worker that treated us like we were unimportant customers.</li><li>Bottom line, I like their food, but they definitely have a lot of room for customer service improvement.</li><li>It 's one of those places that look slightly sketchy and has little service, but the food is worth the lack of service and decor.</li><li>It 's one of those places that look slightly sketchy and has little service, but the food is worth the lack of service

a factor of their shyness perhaps than anything.</li><li>Speedy service and low prices make it an excellent lunch choice.</li><li>Service is what you expect.</li><li>I knew what to expect in Asian places in Toronto ... you wo n't get good service but most of the time, the food is great.</li><li>This is n't a place for good customer service, beautiful decor, nor is it a place to seek for smiling faces.</li><li>I may have to go somewhere else where the food is comparable, but the service better ... it really is too bad.</li><li>Service has been consistently decent and is a nice place to eat for cheap.</li><li>Service is fast and attentive and I absolutely love hearing the Vietnamese ambient music as I slurp on a perfect steaming hot bowl of Pho Dac Biet.</li><li>Service was generally excellent, mostly by young students ( I think) with fairly good English.</li><li>Besides the occasional line out the door and long waits during peak times, service is quick and the food is great.</li><li>Service from the ladies was meh but whatever, I 'm here for the food.</li><li>If you come not expecting impeccable service but simple tasty food at a great price you 'll be a happy camper.</li><li>Food is good but not worth going for because service is terrible.</li><li>However, their customer service is terrible.</li><li>This place is filthy and the service is horrible.</li><li>I 've found that service is extremely slow so it 's normal to wait 15 minutes or sometimes much longer to get an order.</li><li>The owners are usually quite friendly and chatty, but I think overall the food is medicocre and the service is slow.</li><li>Service was a tad slow.</li><li>Great patio, good service, good prices, amazing apps, and a disappointing burger.</li><li>Overall the service was terrible except for the hostess who greeted us and had us sit within 5 minutes.</li><li>The service was quite slow- we were served by the bartender rather than an actual server.</li><li>Server was a sweetheart, but pretty unremarkable service.</li><li>Pros: + tasty food + fast service Cons:- the menu was warn and unatractive- some of the food came a bit burnt.</li><li>Service: 5/5 stars.</li><li>Cheers! first time back after 4 years because of horrible service at the yonge and hwy 7 location.</li><li>Service is fine, the lady is helpful and

good.</li><li>Great service!</li><li>The problem is that the customer service.</li><li>Slowest and worst service ever.</li><li>The service has never been particularly good, you have to wait quite a while for the food and the food has never been stellar.</li><li>Service was great.</li><li>Great service though!</li><li>The service here is fantastic!</li><li>They now also serve AYCE menu which I have yet to try, but their welcoming service always make me feel at home even if I just order take-out.</li><li>They had a very small selection but the pluses were:- very little rice in the maki- yum- dynamite rolls sooo fweeesh- coconut shrimp GET IN MY BELLY- deep fried squid, you sexy beast.- spicy salmon maki with sauce SQUISHED in between two salmons INSIDE the maki. !?!?!?- pop included in price- fast service, nice service would defo come back!</li><li>They had a very small selection but the pluses were:- very little rice in the maki- yum- dynamite rolls sooo fweeesh- coconut shrimp GET

service and food from Pizzaiolo, I would avoid this location at all cost.</li><li>Rude service ... believe me ...</li><li>I am willing to compromise a bit of quality if the food is good .... but horrible quality and horrible service ... so disappointing P. S- Your time and money means nothing to them.</li><li>We were the only table that night, and the service was still terrible.</li><li>The service was fine.</li><li>The service was great, but we were there late so not many people.</li><li>The first time I went, the service was really bad.</li><li>At my second visit, the waiter was very sweet and provided great service but he charged us for spring rolls we did not order.</li><li>I like this sushi bar because it 's clean, the location is convenient, and the service is friendly.</li><li>Service is good.</li><li>4.5 stars for quality of food! 4 starts for cleanliness and atmosphere, and service.</li><li>Service was slow.</li><li>But because of the lack of honesty with the bill, lazy service and small portions, I have no option other than suggest you stay away from this place.</li><li>Friendly service!</li><li>The service at this restaurant is pretty good.</li><li>Service was relatively quick, but with only two wait staff it took them a while to serve our entire group of about 10 people.</li><li>Overall, the place exceeded my expectations for service and food quality only because of the low reviews the place received.</li><li>Cons:- though the servers are very friendly, service can sometimes be slow if they forget to come back to check on you.</li><li>Nice décor, ok service.</li><li>Worst service I have ever received !!!</li><li>While I remember the sushi being good, the service now is terrible.</li><li>Service is as important if not more then the product.</li><li>Bad service, we paid for tips and

which is necessary for lunch service).</li><li>Service was terrible.</li><li>Service was the worst of the year.</li><li>In terms of service, if you make the mistake of sitting in the bar, they forget about you and do n't clear your plates nor refill your tea.</li><li>Best to get table service.</li><li>Service was quick even though the place was packed.</li><li>Also the service was horrible.</li><li>-2 points for scam and- 1 more point for horrible service.</li><li>The service was disappointing.</li><li>I would n't recommend this place for their rolls. convenient location, inside the emptess walk plaza, downstair from the movie theatre. the food is average and service is okay but i find it expensive compared to the quality of the food. but i understand it is due to the location. but i 'd go to other sushi place just a steeet away at sheppard where u have more choice: kiyomizu, ichiban springgarde, sakura, sushi moto, and sushi one. the price is cheaper w better quality bc of the competition.</li><li>Overall the service killed the lunch.</li><li>Was not the first time I have been disappointed by the service here.</li><li>Service left a lot to be desired.</li><li>Fast service, good prices too!</li><li>Some people have mentioned the service; I found that the service was the best part of my experience here.</li><li>Some people have mentioned the

slow.</li><li>Service was a bit slow that day but that was probably due to the mid-workday lunch rush.</li><li>Food was n't quite reasonable for the price; not sure if we left a tip or not for the quality of service.</li><li>Service 2.5/5 ( 15% of final grade) The service was the norm.</li><li>The place is not usually busy, but the service is always slow.</li><li>Sashimi was okay and Service was on the slower side.</li><li>Service- 3/5- this is a mom and pop run restaurant but they do n't seem to have enough staff to tend to all of their customers needs and attention.</li><li>Service was slow, especially after I was done eating.</li><li>Service was alright, atmosphere was OK, but what will keep me from coming back here is the sub-par food, the lack of decent portions and the whack prices.</li><li>Went here a few times with a group of four people and the service has been the exact same every time.</li><li>Customer service is extremely poor, lady messed up on our order and argued with us that we were wrong.</li><li>The service and prices are average ranging from $ 10 to $ 50 depending on what you order.</li><li>Once food was served the service was very slow.</li><li>So we ordered out over priced dishes that came with a nice service.</li><li>Other flaws include overpriced average food, slow service, no wifi, and smooth jazz elevator music.</li><li>Service decent.</li><li>The 2 stars are for the poor service ( Update November 2016: upgraded to 3 star due to last time being quite good, the manager made sure we were making it for our movie!).</li><li>Service: If the staff smiled more and were a bit more welcoming when you arrived, it would earn them another star.</li><li>And the service unsurprisingly poor.</li><li>Mediocre food and service.</li><li>Worst service I have ever had.</li><li>This is not the first time that I have had horrible service here.</li><li>Service: As others have said, service can be fairly slow and inattentive.</li><li>Service: As others have said, service can be fairly slow and inattentive.</li><li>Did not service us share plates or soil sauce tray for our sushi boat.</li><li>The owner lady was not even apologetic about our service, and made a stink that we did n't leave them tips.</li><li>Much better sushi places in the area for MUCH cheaper and better customer service ( ie. sushi bong).</li><li>Bad- slow service.</li><li>Terrible service, unprofessional staff, below par sushi.</li><li>Nice presentation and prompt service.</li><li>Service is slow because they are lack of staff.</li><li>Service was friendly and quick, considering we were one of 2 tables.</li><li>Bad service.</li><li>Service is average this would fairly sit on 3 stars.</li><li>Two stars are generally reserved for places that have pretty bad food and have good service.</li><li>If a place has horrible food and bad service, that 's a one star restaurant in my book.</li><li>They also do n't cut up their own meat and get it from a service company the Food Inspection Branch has told me.</li><li>I have been to ALL their locations .. attentive service ... clean utensils .... my date went well!</li><li>The service kind of lagged, since they did not take our empty plates on time and when I had no choice but to place my empty plate on the empty table next to us, they complained that I should n't do so.</li><li>Zero happiness exists in this location and just outright rude service.</li><li>I 've been to this location many times and the table service is always horrible.</li><li>Awesome service.</li><li>I 've been to other Mandarin Restaurant before but this one way better service and much cleaner.</li><li>The service was good, our server was helpful but a bit pushy for us to order, I guess it was because we got there fairy late and stayed until closing.</li><li>Was quite impressed with the service, fresh ingredients and cozy atmosphere.</li><li>I 've been here on business lunches, and it 's a very cute little restaurant with great service.</li><li>I always get great service, however, and that 's what keeps me coming back for more ( if and when I 'm in the area).</li><li>This was our third visit to Yuki Restaurant, and we were expecting good food and decent service, which is what we 'd experienced before.</li><li>We are not expecting stellar service every time, but we do n't appreciate being lied to and wasting our money on food we cannot even eat.</li><li>Empty glasses of water, no customer service and even wrong the bill with food never ordered or eat!</li><li>Seems they were somewhat understaffed at the time as well but the service was decent.</li><li>Good sushi and good service.</li><li>Service was very good, all of our dishes were removed the moment we finished, and our tea was always full.</li><li>Full extra star for the service, and being a decent option for lunch in a neighborhood where you would not expect it.</li><li>Service was acceptable.</li><li>It can get pretty busy here and when that happens, service is usually compromised.</li><li>However, service is good.</li><li>Well it was good, its not all you can eat and kinda on the pricier side but nice for dinner for 2 The restaurant was clean and the service was great.</li><li>Ever since new management took over, the portion size is considerably smaller, the sushi not as fresh and the service leaves a lot to be desired.</li><li>Very attentive service cleaned everything away quickly.</li><li>How can the service be so poor, epecially when it 's not busy, and she had a computer screen infront of her face, orders that she punched in, and still make it wrong.</li><li>The service was quick, and everyone in the shop was nice.</li><li>Ameretto sour tasted funky, nice wings, nice service but not worth the trip from west town just to try them.</li><li>The wings were the usual, but the service was very disappointing.</li><li>The staff have been there since for years the service is good they do their very best to make sure that you have a good experience, since its so busy you may have to grab the servers attention.</li><li>Service here is lackluster.</li><li>I 've had some pretty subpar service here but at least the food is good.</li><li>First of all the service was slow, Second of all the wings were over-cooked and cold ..</li><li>Overall: Decent atmosphere and service but nothing special about the food.</li><li>Service was decent, but not too friendly.</li><li>Talk about customer service.</li><li>I would go early, we had to wait a bit to get a table, but once you 're in service is super quick.</li><li>Wonderful service, great potions and good coffee!</li><li>Service was excellent; coffee, tea, and water refills came often.</li><li>It 's a low/key, not fancy diner with excellent service, reasonable prices and delicious food.</li><li>The service is always fast and the food is consistently cooked well and served at very large portions.</li><li>Service is quick, but not the friendliest when they get busy.</li><li>Great food and service.</li><li>The service was warm and friendly.</li><li>Service was predictably a little shaky when the doors first opened, but inside a couple of months things were running tight with a friendly wait staff, a cheap before 11:00am breakfast special ( $ 3.99 for toast, breakfast potatoes, a couple of eggs and bacon/sausage) and some truly delicious burgers and sandwiches.</li><li>Service: Was welcoming and warm, although nothing exceptional.</li><li>The service was excellent.</li><li>Over all, if you are n't looking for service and just want a quick egg breakfast this place is decent.</li><li>I love this place .. all day breakfast is great and service is out of this world !! my server, both visits, remembered everything about my order from the time before which was about a month prior ..!</li><li>Usual diner seating, great service and very good brunch.</li><li>The restaurant was packed but the service was very friendly and efficient.</li><li>Service, taste and atmosphere were excellent. looking forward to next time.</li><li>Mind you the food was n't bad nor was the service but having read the reviews I was expecting amazing food that would make me want to keep coming back.</li><li>Unfortunately it was n't, the food was okay ( like most diner food), good quantity and good service.</li><li>Friendly service, reasonable value, decent food- wo n't wow you but holds its own.</li><li>Great service, good food, love their bacon, just very pricey on the beverages_ 3 dollar tea, 5 for juice ???</li><li>Hotel rates not diner_ I 'll go back for the bacon and service.</li><li>The service is very pleasant and amicable and the prices are reasonable.</li><li>The owner is always polite and the service is great.</li><li>Amazing food ordered egg benedictine for me &amp; Bonnies hash for my husband .. both were terrific i gave it 4 out of 5 though excellent service &amp; yummy food cause the place was hot i think the ac was broke.</li><li>Service was prompt and efficient.</li><li>Friendly service and somewhat quick service since there was only 1 server.</li><li>Friendly service and somewhat quick service since there was only 1 server.</li><li>Service was friendly and fast.</li><li>Service was pretty good.</li><li>The service was great, they always made sure we had enough coffee, which was n't bad as well, a lot better than what I expected it to be coming from a diner.</li><li>Stellar service and better food.</li><li>Ambiance was nice, service was odd, place was very tight and crowded, food was served luke-warm.</li><li>A nice place to come to breakfast Pros: Nice place for breakfast Friendly service Cons: If you 're not

very friendly though it can get slow when the place is packed.</li><li>It was not very busy when I arrived ( I seem to say this a lot in my Monday morning breakfast reviews!), so service was very quick, and the waitress was really perky.</li><li>Good service, nice atmosphere ( but very loud).</li><li>Everyone raved about their hearty brunch and great service.</li><li>What really adds to the charm of this place is the service.</li><li>It was our first time trying this place. everything was great. the food, the service was excellent. their fresh orange juice was awesome. it was a bit hot

always had our cups full of green tea.</li><li>Service was still good but the food was very lackluster.</li><li>When we were getting ready to leave, our server came over to collect our boxes and

food.</li><li>Good service.</li><li>The service: Decent.</li><li>The service we had was exceptional and well knowledgable when it came to decision making.</li><li>Staff very courteous, polite, and

service when you think that you can pull a wool over their eyes.</li><li>Service is okay.</li><li>The service is lightning fast and friendly.</li><li>Efficient service.</li><li>I felt guilty not being able to finish everything.): Service: Service here is also good.</li><li>Service was great and prices made us smile.</li><li>The soup tastes average, toppings: poor, side dishes: average, service: not great, meh Is n't worth the money, not even eight bucks.</li><li>The service is efficient and polite but not overly friendly and it is sometimes hard to understand them.</li><li>Though, the service is much better than nak won, which is another Korean restaurant down the street from this.</li><li>My coworker and I spent the entire afternoon chugging down water to try and balance the amount of salt in the soup and kimchi We got 2x combination 1 ( $ 8.85), which had exactly 1 shrimp ( mini one) and 1 mussel, and maybe 2 bites of beef The bibimbap ( $ 11.51) had no beef ( we had to send t back to the kitchen) Awful experience, good service though.</li><li>Stuff &amp; owner are very friendly people, fast service, price are very cheap, foods are not good as the others things, unfortunately.</li><li>As for the service, they are very efficient.</li><li>Though crowded and packed, it has a warm friendly environment with amazing service.</li><li>The service is alright and I

service and ate the chicken-bento-box with soup, small salad, 4 sushi rolls, rice and tofu.</li><li>Service: Service is attentive and quite ok.</li><li>We usually enjoy ourselves here and I have seen far worse service.</li><li>The service was ok .... food was another story.</li><li>The only issue I have with it is the long wait-times for a chef to come to your teppanyaki table. service and quality has gotten worse over the past five years I 've been dining here. sloooow to get items, even when a la carte, no refills on water glasses, wrong order after wrong order.</li><li>Terrible food, terrible service.</li><li>Service: Horrible.</li><li>ALL of these things were listed on the menu ... they also seem very stinge with everything. servings are small ... which could be a good thing ... i ordered beef sashimi .. that must be the most horrifying color i have ever seen ... it looked like rotting corpse from the walking dead color. just looked wrong .. please see pics. ordered the beef ribs ... it came out jet black burnt ... see pic. why would you bother serving it ? it makes no sense. the dude left a paper on our table and did not take the order, so i brought it to the front since i was going to the washroom ... he then gives me a lecture saying dont give orders to the front desk. i wouldnt have to if your service was better. water was never filled once. the only reason this place gets 2 star is because they had red tuna as a sashimi choice. which btw came out two different colors .. one time it was red .. the second time i ordered it was light pink ... i suspect they gave me F grade fish the second time around.</li><li>I have to say the service is really slow and the waitresses are n't very attentive.</li><li>Service was fine.</li><li>First time service was good and food was fine.</li><li>Service was slow and rude.</li><li>The waitresses wear tacky `` Asian-inspired'' outfits but have absolutely no concept of good customer service.</li><li>Poor service with a dated check in system that looks like a page out of the Flintstones error.</li><li>Things like atmosphere, value, service, and the general buzz of a place can make or break a good time.</li><li>From coordinating the surprise birthday cake to accommodating me with my allergies, the service was exceptional.</li><li>Service was on slower side but it was very busy night with line ups at the door.</li><li>The service was horrible, and the waiters were n't helpful at all.</li><li>Issues with Service: This is my second time visiting this place and it is shocking how bad the service has gotten.</li><li>Issues with Service: This is my second time visiting this place and it is shocking how bad the service has gotten.</li><li>The service is very slow.</li><li>Though this place has been a long-lasting restaurant Toronto, the service has certainly gone downhill.</li><li>Stay away during the evening slow hours- horrible horrible service- never again.</li><li>It was great and all, but the service was slow and not really worth the wait.</li><li>And terrible service when told of a food allergy.</li><li>There are other teppanyaki restaurants that are better in service and provides the same quality of food as memories of Japan.</li><li>I have always been a fan eating here for their teppanyaki dinner, however their service quality has declined over the year not only for dine in but also for delivery, having to wait 1-1/2 hr for your delivery food is not a joke even if they 're busy.</li><li>Compare to Genghis Khan Mongolian Grill next door, with the same price you get much more, plus fresh food and better service.</li><li>However, as the evening went on the service continued to go downhill.</li><li>Service was good, friendly staff.</li><li>Service may be slightly slow when they are busy.</li><li>I am OK with it because food quality is more important to me than service.</li><li>The service is always quick, the staff are always friendly and the food is always fresh and delicious.</li><li>Portion size is generous and the service is great, but the food just does n't cut it.</li><li>The service was definitely the best thing about them.</li><li>The worst service I ever had.</li><li>I had to constantly wait for my server for service and he had a major attitude problem.</li><li>Maybe it 's because I look young and therefore he did n't treat my friends and I with any respect ( we used a groupon service as well).</li><li>I 'm sad to write this review, but I had to let people know about the bad service and mediocre food.</li><li>Service is very friendly.</li><li>Though the service was good.</li><li>Service has always been very prompt.</li><li>I regret that everything aside from the ambiance and prompt service is absolutely horrific.</li><li>The lone waitress was nice and welcoming .. and we received excellent service.</li><li>Honestly, THE WORST customer service.</li><li>Since this place changed management, the quality of the food and service both took a deep dive.</li><li>Last night my friend and I went through the drive-thru after leaving a bakery due to rude customer service.</li><li>The service is very bad.</li><li>Service: better.</li><li>Review: I still would n't take `` guests'' there as there are tons of restaurants with MUCH better service and better food.</li><li>The food quality is mediocre at best, the prices are high and the service is nonexistent.</li><li>We sit down- and usually this is when a waiter notices and brings us utensils and napkins- but we get NO service until we ask them and they only bring us napkins ... okay no biggie.</li><li>So I ask one of the employees if he can help me, and he just goes to the back grabs a plate and just literally scoops a heap of their honey garlic chicken and dumps it on a half scoop of old rice and hands it to me ... great service.</li><li>When you place your order, the service person at the perspective counter swipe your card and you are to pay when leaving the restaurant.</li><li>The minuses can and may or may not be limited to kids running around, which may or may not be to your perference; grouchy-faced employees; not exactly efficient service for your food; I think the BF 's pasta took longer than it should have and it apparently was n't that good.</li><li>Including the `` service'' charge- the `` service'' not including carting my full to the brim coffee 3/4 's of the way through the restaurant.</li><li>Including the `` service'' charge- the `` service'' not including carting my full to the brim coffee 3/4 's of the way through the restaurant.</li><li>The service was certainly lacking; I can understand that it was after 9:00pm on a Wednesday night so they probably do n't expect a lot of customers mid-week but the employees who were working were just disinterested.</li><li>The servers clearing the tables were mostly cheery and efficient, but I feel overall that the service used to be better.</li><li>I would give it to out of five stars because first of all it is very noisy second of all they charge an extra 10% off service fee.</li><li>Service is hit or miss depending on how busy it is.</li><li>What I do like about this place is the decor, the friendly and efficient service and the variety of food.</li><li>The service at this place is not very good.</li><li>Could n't agree more with the previous few posts- this place is OVERPRICED with LOUSY SERVICE and they have the temerity to charge a 10% gratuity for self-serve!</li><li>We got there around 3pm and the service was very nice and helpful.</li><li>Service was nice so I give it three stars.</li><li>Only drawback was service was a tad slow and it was n't busy.</li><li>The service was okay.</li><li>Service was very friendly and accommodating.</li><li>Service was great at first but then started to get super freakin ' annoying ...</li><li>Service was excellent.</li><li>Overall a great experience. i was sooo offended. as the manager of a bar, i understand some things take time, but being rudely greeted by the bar staff and ignored for 10 minutes while they do nothing is pretty bad to begin. having the barstaff whispering to each other while blatantly pointing at my friend is obscene. we asked to move to a table. they said fine, no one brought us menus or asked us if we wanted drinks. the bitchy blond bartender walked right by the table 4 times, making a point of not looking at us and cleaning tables right next to ours, yet still ignoring us. then she walked to the edge of the bar and twirled her hair for a bit, all the while making sure not to make eye contact with us. we finally went over to the bar and asked the guy if we could get menus or drinks or service, explaining to him that we have been waiting for ten minutes, when he rudely informed me that i had only been waiting 20 seconds. so i asked for the bill from our drink at the bar, had my tip rudely returned to me, amid more whispering and pointing at us. im disgusted and quite upset about being treated like that, especially because i used to be quite a regular there, and im a big tipper and very polite ( dont forget i manage a bar, and it should be all about customer service). i wouldnt recomend this place to anybody for any reason. maybe a different location, not this one.</li><li>Overall a great experience. i was sooo offended. as

visits.</li><li>Overall, food and service was good however, I 've always felt that the food here is a bit overpriced.</li><li>Their service is alright.</li><li>Service is awesome ... food fantastic.</li><li>I had dinner there alone two days ago, there was no one service me !!!!</li><li>Service was super kind and not in the usual obnoxious chain service way, but genuine and nice.</li><li>Service was super kind and not in the usual obnoxious chain service way, but genuine and nice.</li><li>Came here for lunch a little while ago with my mother who was visiting from out of town, the service was absolutely horrible.</li><li>We ordered and the food was out shortly, as my mother ordered the Montreal smoked meat sandwich ( as it is her favourite anywhere we go), there was something quite rancid tasting about the meat, it had an odd smell and colour to the meat, as we were already in a rush from waiting so long for service we would n't have had time to choose another menu item/send it back, but that would not have mattered since our server did not come by once to check on how the food was.</li><li>The service was not very good as there was an approximate 10 minute gap between receiving my food and my girlfriend receiving her food.</li><li>Service is not bad either, I usually give the waitresses slack for not being too quick on super busy nights like UFC.</li><li>I 've been to the other location and the service, food and broth are not the same.</li><li>AWESOME late nite/ 24 hr KALBI TANG or KAMJATANG place is a lil dirty, service is slow, but for 3 am yum at a decent price this place is the place to be in north york ( even though the selection of late night places in the area are very slim- subway is open till 3am across the street) i give them props for dealing with all the drunken stupers though, who roll in there wanting some home style korean! kimchi is very spicy! i choke everytime. hahaha, but they do give you as much as you want.</li><li>Great food and customer service.</li><li>The service is really quick and the only downside is they accept debit/credit with orders over $ 20.</li><li>The service is prompt and efficient which is what you would expect.</li><li>She told us she could n't do it, so she got the younger guy, with glasses, about 6 ' 3 ( new management waiting staff) and I had seen him before, he has given me very racist service as well and very judgemental to me and my Dad in the past.</li><li>Service: The staff were quite friendly, and the service was pretty speedy and efficient.</li><li>Service: The staff were quite friendly, and the service was pretty speedy and efficient.</li><li>The service is fast, even if the servers seem like they have not slept in a few days.</li><li>Do n't expect to have top notch service, they do n't exist here.</li><li>Did n't expect much from the service but my company and I enjoyed our food.</li><li>Good but we prefer the one at christie and bloor:) friendlier service and even though theyre both Owl for some reason the pork bone soup at the one at christie and bloor is better.</li><li>The service was really meh.</li><li>Service was good and the food was pretty good.</li><li>I still ate it however i did add a lot of salt in the soup so that helped somewhat. the service i would give a 2.5/5 because the employees do n't respond to you, even if you wave down a waiter they 'll just ignore you. i did find my bf 's bulgogi dish appetizing, along with the kimchi. although my gom tang was n't as expected, i will probably be back here on a random night craving for some korean food. i am pretty sure there are better dishes they have to offer. pretty convenient that there 's a private parking lot. ( that 's a plus for me bc we hate looking for parking and paying the ticket in general).</li><li>They were pretty quick with service but it seems like they 're always focused on something else.</li><li>Sides are yummy, kim chi is spicy, and service is fast.</li><li>Their service is 3/5, but all the boys servers are extremely polite.</li><li>I am a fan of their service because they make my friends and I feel special every time we go, even though they probably do that for everyone.</li><li>Do n't expect much with their service bc you will be disappointed.</li><li>Service is non-existent and customers are treated like shit.</li><li>Service is okay.</li><li>The place is always packed so service is quick.</li><li>Do n't expect the service to drop by your table every now and then.</li><li>I do like the quick and friendly service and the fact that they pretty much never close.</li><li>Service was ok they came to the table with chopsticks spoons scissor and cups and water right away they did n't give hot tea which I was shocked about especially last night was a cold night they gave icy water ..</li><li>I can only say they lack on service is checking if their customers are òk not all tables have those special buttons to call for service so we had to ask the table next to us if we can borrow their button to get some service cause they did n't look in our direction which was next to the entrance.</li><li>I can only say they lack on service is checking if their customers are òk not all tables have those special buttons to call for service so we had to ask the

but I do n't want to be chased down for a tip cause it has happened to me before in that area so did n't want to risk it.</li><li>Service went horrible after that ..</li><li>The food is mediocre but the SERVICE WAS BAD.</li><li>Although their food is decent their service was horrible and it was really dark in there today- the only lights that were on were the ones on the wall which were pictures of their food ... and I know they aint trying to set the mood and be all romantic lol.</li><li>The button on the wall to call for service obviously does n't work.</li><li>The ladies serving look miserable and it 's starting to show in their service.</li><li>Quick service and prices are good too !!</li><li>Service is minimal, basically give you what you need, the menu and water when you sit, chopsticks and bowls after you order.</li><li>I ca n't complain about the service too much.</li><li>24hrs, quick service, good food.</li><li>Service was ok, but they do n't allow splitting the bill and no credit card below $ 20 i believe.</li><li>Service is fantastic and generally very quick.</li><li>Service is typically k-style.</li><li>THIS SHOULD NOT BE CONFUSED WITH RUDE SERVICE.</li><li>There is very little parking in front and service is not fast during busy times.</li><li>Service is especially slow during times where there are many private parties in the restaurant.</li><li>Great food, but more importantly amazing service.</li><li>Service is lovely and everyone is nice.</li><li>Food was pretty good, service was awesome and overall a good experience.</li><li>Service was lovely.</li><li>Service is huge to me which is why I say so.</li><li>Very thoughtful service never been disappoint and v authentic imo.</li><li>I could overlook the service and give it a higher rating, but the pho was n't good.</li><li>Efficient service and the noodles were pretty tasty.</li><li>Great service and hefty portion size.</li><li>Other then the service and experience, the food phone was pretty good.</li><li>Also, the staff were friendly, the service was great and once ordered the food came out really quickly!</li><li>Also, nice service and people!</li><li>Great service and good food.</li><li>She gave really good service and some customers were really happy.</li><li>My mom actually knows the owner of the restaurant so service is ALWAYS outstanding.</li><li>Wings were good but service was subpar.</li><li>He has no clue what a good customer service means.</li><li>Although, I 've had some negative experiences in terms of service here in the past.</li><li>There dill sauce is amazing with the fries !! this place is terrible !!! the service sucks, and the staff and `` management'' are rude! it took the waitress 15 minutes to come and check on us. when we asked for a drink, she just never came back so we had to make our way to the bar ourselves.</li><li>We complained about the service to the `` manager'', a weird looking guy came.</li><li>Service was n't the best but it 's a tuesday night and wings are half off, and its a full house so what do you expect ?</li><li>If youre with the guys/gals i would recommend sitting in the bar area where theres a better atmosphere and, I suspect, better service.</li><li>We definitely wont be back on the basis of the overall poor service.</li><li>On the positive side, the Korean BBQ beef coleslaw sandwich and fries were really delicious ... i did n't even need to use their special garlic dill dip but i recommend ordering the dip with your fries to have a fresh change from ketchup sometimes. today 's soup was beef barley which was average as was the double amaretto sour however i was pleased they offered fresh options and could accommodate my off-menu drink request. final tip- do not order the nachos here. they were pretty bad ... happy i can always get great nachos at my joint fox n fiddle finch. hope the manager can fix the crappy service here because I 'd like to come back to watch a game and taste the fajita tacos, fish tacos or one of their tempting burgers. ok last last tip i dont know if i should write this but the servers are pretty so i guess that could be a plus for those who appreciate that sort of thing.</li><li>Absolutely horrible service.</li><li>Horrible service and food.</li><li>Service and food is disgusting.</li><li>The service was horrible as well, all new staff.</li><li>Modern decor, good service, great food quality.</li><li>The service is fast and the food comes flying out the kitchen.:-).</li><li>The food is on another level from all the other locations, and the service is attentive.</li><li>Such a long wait time and they have really poor service.</li><li>Food was very good the service was mediocre.</li><li>The service is always excellent and fast, especially if we get the waiter called Yin Tung.</li><li>Great food and good service!</li><li>The service at this location is especially good and food comes out fast.</li><li>I tried to do take out here to avoid the sloppiness of the staff 's customer service, but each time i take out i do not get what i order or the food depreciate in taste and quality.</li><li>Not that I have tried all other locations, I am just happy this one is close by, and the food and service has been consistent ever since they opened here.</li><li>The service is exactly what you expect from a chinese restaurant .... medicore and rude at best.</li><li>They 've also implemented a table service system with a tabletop device with buttons indicating if you need service, want to order, or want the bill.</li><li>They 've also implemented a table service system with a tabletop device with buttons indicating if you need service, want to order, or want the bill.</li><li>This is super convenient for non-Chinese speakers and ensures your service comes timely without battling the other patrons to catch servers ' attention.</li><li>Remarkably loud, the food and service were pretty good for a place as full as this.</li><li>Service was really good, staff was helpful and attentive.</li><li>Good service and staff !!!</li><li>We did n't come for a cheap meal, but the quality of food nor service met our expectation.</li><li>Service can be amateurish and non attentive and the waiters feels too relax gossipping within themselves.</li><li>By the way, the service here was not too bad.</li><li>The service was wonderful as well.</li><li>Overall, pretty good food, but not the greatest; wonderful service and atmosphere.</li><li>Great service.</li><li>However, for a Chinese restaurant, service can be pretty terrible at times.</li><li>Service is efficient and quick.</li><li>Service ?</li><li>And not one `` sorry'' or otherwise when we grumbled about the service.</li><li>Would have given this place a 4 star or maybe even a 4.5 star had I felt charitable, but the service just blew the whole thing for me.</li><li>Service is OK nothing great.</li><li>We are very disappointment with both the service and food quality.</li><li>Service was decent but the kitchen was slow.</li><li>Service was rushed.</li><li>Service was good too considering the amount of people that were there.</li><li>Service was fast and amazing.</li><li>Service was quick, bathrooms were clean.</li><li>I 'm a fan of their service.</li><li>The service is fine, I like that the tea is served in the thermos pot which keeps it nice and hot and it is being constantly refilled with hot water.</li><li>Always consistent service and food quality.</li><li>Service is fast.</li><li>This is one of the nicer Chinese restaurants in the area in terms of service and atmosphere.</li><li>Super quick service.</li><li>Fast service, it 's our favorite chain restaurant.</li><li>The service here is real friendly too, and it 's not just Asians here as it is a bit nicer.</li><li>The thing I was most impressed about was the good service.</li><li>Chinese restaurants usually have horrible service with attitude but not here.</li><li>I liked how their menu included pictures so none chinese folks can have a glimps of what some of the dishes look like ( ones we got loomed identical to the photos) I took one star away due to their poor service.</li><li>Pros: great food, lots of variety of dish Cons: loudness of clanging utensil at the back &amp; lack of good service.</li><li>The service here is a bit chaotic, but you will never have an empty teapot.</li><li>These are characterized by generally reasonable prices, less than stellar decor, no attention on service, and minimal attempt at making the food look nice.</li><li>The service is noticeably better than other Chinese places.</li><li>I found service to be super fast and efficient.</li><li>The food and service were great.</li><li>I 'm so disappointed because I love Asian Legend ( and other location but something happened today where some of the food was terrible and the service mediocre It was Sunday around 1:30pm and the place was pretty full.</li><li>In terms of service, they would be attentive, but no one speaks cantonese anymore!</li><li>Service is okay.</li><li>Their service is always attentive and great consistently ( even when it 's super busy) 2.</li><li>Service is above average for a Chinese restaurant, no real complaints.</li><li>Service is quite good Food: come in large portions with a very reasonable price They give you free red bean soup as dessert.</li><li>The new staff appears preoccupied with other matters and not caring much of the quality of service.</li><li>Friendly service but almost always busy.</li><li>Food 1.0/5 Service 2.0/5 Ambiance 1.0/5 Value 4.0/5 = = = = = = = = = Overall 1.30/5.</li><li>The cake and sangria was good but the environment and service was substandard.</li><li>CONCLUSION: Customer service is a distinguishing factor in today 's competitive environment and this restaurant does n't cut it.</li><li>We were all pretty happy with the food and the service was pretty good.</li><li>I actually really enjoy the decor here and the service.</li><li>I 've been to the restaurant a few times and thought that the service was terrible, the food was average, and the dessert was okay.</li><li>Cons: The service on busy nights is terrible.</li><li>Service was slow but It was obvious her and the other server in the restaurant were over stressed.</li><li>After experiencing poor service and avg food on more than one occasion, and witnessing and hearing about how terrible they treat their staff, Ill take my business else where.</li><li>The service was ok nothing to rave about.</li><li>Perhaps I just happened to go at the right time, but I did n't have any of the substandard service I 've read about from other Yelpers.</li><li>Service has always been pleasant so no quams there.</li><li>Service is generally bad during the day and my review is n't very helpful.</li><li>Service was still the worst- ever- but this time, the black napkins dyed our hands, and faces black.</li><li>Service was really great considering that we had 20 + yapping young adults who almost sat there for about an hour trying to decide what to get.</li><li>Unfortunately, the service was terrible.</li><li>I have also come here with friends as well and even then we had great service and good food with minimal supervision and a very laid back setting which to me did n't bother me at all.</li><li>With the prompt and friendly service that they have displayed thus far, I will for sure be a repeat customer.</li><li>My disappointment was little to do with the food and more to do with the service.</li><li>The only thing that dropped this from a four to a three star, was the lack of reliable service.</li><li>Bottom line, a return visit is in order, and hopefully the service wo n't be a mirage. ( pun intended).</li><li>Service was bit slow but very attentive.</li><li>Service was attentive.</li><li>The service was good: Courteous and reasonably quick.</li><li>The service was a bit

very friendly and effective service, pleasant patrons.</li><li>Service is quick, however.</li><li>Service is quick and dismissive but the sandwiches are fresh as any.</li><li>The prices are a little high, particularly on the add-ons and the service feels a little arrogant at times, but the food makes up for it.</li><li>Delicious does not consider the ambiance of the restaurant, the level of service from the staff or the prices.</li><li>Great food and service.</li><li>However, the service here is not the best.</li><li>Although the sandwich is not bad, the service and experiences I had here would not prompt me to return.</li><li>Service is always friendly.</li><li>Service was very friendly.</li><li>They got my order wrong once but the husband and wife who run the joint are very accommodating and always on par with their costumer service.</li><li>Service was fast and the lady serving was friendly.</li><li>Service by a mother ( presumably) the owner and what appeared to be her son was very friendly, accommodating and helpful.</li><li>Have always received consistent and attentive service here.</li><li>They service is friendly and the restaurant is clean and well decorated.</li><li>I doubted you when the service started off slow but, man, did it finish with a bang!</li><li>While there were a few hiccups here and there, I can say again that the service overall was very good.</li><li>Service is great and super attentive at La Vecchia but lacks `` it''- that unique personal touch to service that helps make the experience and diner-vendor rapport that much memorable.</li><li>Service is great and super attentive at La Vecchia but lacks `` it''- that unique personal touch to service that helps make the experience and diner-vendor rapport that much

seek employment elsewhere if they ca n't handle it.</li><li>Back then Staff was rude, service non existent.</li><li>Due to service.</li><li>Me and my wife went here last Sunday and we find it a nice place to eat, good service and nice foods.</li><li>First time here and the service was great.</li><li>But service was great.</li><li>Although the service was slow, and when I say slow it means we waited for almost an hour to get our food ..</li><li>The food here is good, but it 's the service that keeps me coming back here.</li><li>This location provided the very best service we have ever received at any Cora 's Breakfast &amp; Lunch location we have dined at.</li><li>I was very impressed with my service from Paula and for the most part, the food received.</li><li>Overall the quality of food and service rates a three out of five, but definitely not to be a regular joint.</li><li>Where they have wonderful food, service and ambiance.</li><li>I would strongly recommend some proper training, not only in food safety, customer service, but also proper interviewing would help, before hiring a bunch of dead beat miserable, un knowledgable ' staff' and out the rest in the back to take out the trash!</li><li>I 've been to this location many times &amp; never disappointed- despite always being busy, the service is always great.</li><li>This is my go-to location because of the excellent service.</li><li>Service has always been exceptional and my water glass never went empty.</li><li>Service is fast and friendly.</li><li>I used to work in the service industry and am pretty understanding about that sentiment.</li><li>They are always busy but never packed ( except Sunday from 10-12) so we never have an issue getting a table and the service is always fantastic.</li><li>Service was quick and friendly and overall, we had a great time.</li><li>Not worthy of a ' Meh, I 've had better' two star but since I ca n't give a two and a half star, I 'll have to up it to a three ( mostly because of the service).</li><li>And it was absolutely delicious and the service way better, and just on the other side of Cora 's walls.</li><li>I have to agree with everyone here on the service.</li><li>The service was terrible; it was slow and the waitresses are not friendly and do not take their time to answer your questions.</li><li>However, I do not blame them so much for their service; for a big restaurant, two waitresses is far too little; I blame the owner for not hiring more people.</li><li>Very slow service, especially for weekends.</li><li>The pricing was okay, but I 'd rather not pay for terrible service and okay/bad food.</li><li>The yelp reviews are true, the service was really meh.</li><li>Very poor service, and servers were throwing stuff across the tables.</li><li>This was only the start of our disappointment as the service we were provided with was not very friendly or timely.</li><li>The food quality was ok, I ordered the katsu with egg and rice, it was good ( cooked well) and the portion serving was pretty generous, it 's just the service and the lack of a lunch menu that ruined our experience.</li><li>Service is really fast and the food has been consistenly yummy the handful of times that I 've been.</li><li>Service is fast.</li><li>Horrible service.</li><li>Food was decent, service was mediocre.</li><li>I heard an unconfirmed rumor that you get much better service if you 're ethnically Korean and speak the Korean language.</li><li>The SERVICE was just as good as their sister location, which is n't really a COMPLIMENT unfortunately and if it was some impatient unsatisfiable customer they would definitely be in a contest with the wait staff to see WHO can piss who off more.</li><li>TIP #2- They provide each guest with a glass of watered-down Tea which you 'll drink often to clear your tastebuds from one dish to another however if you remember the service, you should ask for a TEA POT of Tea so you can serve yourselves rather than wait to get their attention and for them to take your cup inside to refill.</li><li>Sometimes I just like to TORTURE myself but at the same time good service can be just as scary.</li><li>However, my main problem with this place is the service, or lack thereof.</li><li>The service was terrible, we were not offered tea or water and waitresses did not respond to our calls.</li><li>Service is ok.</li><li>The place was clean with comfortable booths, so other than the service it had a nice ambiance to it.</li><li>Do n't expect the best service though during peak hours.</li><li>At one point, Nak Won was my favorite Korean restaurant and I was proud to bring friends and family to eat solid Korean food with decent service but that time has long gone.</li><li>Last time I frequent this establishment in May 2014 the service has gone to a deplorable level.</li><li>You could have eaten in a prison cafetaria and you might not notice the difference of the service quality.</li><li>However, the reason why I only give 3 rating is bcos of their horrendous service.</li><li>In addition to fast and usually friendly service ( there have been times where they are super busy and its more efficient than friendy), they have awesome side dishes!</li><li>The meal was n't even hot and the service is horrible.</li><li>It is the service that is the definition of nightmare ...</li><li>I 'm not even talking about glacial slow service, I 'm talking about rude servers that not will bluntly ignore you or yell at you.</li><li>I do n't think there 's server a time that we 've received service the first 2 times requesting it.</li><li>Service tends to forget that tips are earn and not an entitlement.</li><li>Most of us, had worked in the service industry once or twice, and can understand the downside of the industry ... but the service we received was absolutely unacceptable.</li><li>Most of us, had worked in the service industry once or twice, and can understand the downside of the industry ... but the service we received was absolutely unacceptable.</li><li>I had a really terrible service last time so I was hoping that it would be better this time.</li><li>The only reason this does n't get 5 stars is the service which is acceptable- more smiles would be nice, but hey, when the food is this good, you can live without it!</li><li>I read most of the reviews prior to coming here, so I was expecting `` terrible service'' among other things.</li><li>You could hear the service bell ringing constantly throughout the meal, which was n't a big deal.</li><li>The cooked egg on top looked very unappetizing with a big mess of green onion thrown in the mix, however Cons:- Service is admittedly very poor.</li><li>If you 're willing to put up with the sub-par service, it 's comfort food for a low price, and at a convenient location.</li><li>I love the potatoes, and always hope that people would be modest in offering me the last piece: P The service is alright.</li><li>Trash service.</li><li>Please do n't tip them for shitty abusive service.</li><li>The service is REALLY slow if the place is packed.</li><li>Service was great.</li><li>If the service is good, I would have been OK.</li><li>But service here is non existent.</li><li>Our experience was decent, and the service was alright which was not overwhelming and also not neglectful.</li><li>One thing that makes it an* A-OK.* ranking is because of their customer service attitude.</li><li>When you go during rush hour, the service there are not as good.</li><li>I ate here and was very disappointed by the level of service and quality of food.* Service* Being Asian, I 'm used to bad service but this Korean place took the icing on the cake for being the most inattentive servers.</li><li>I ate here and was very disappointed by the level of service and quality of food.* Service* Being Asian, I 'm used to bad service but this Korean place took the icing on

Korean place took the icing on the cake for being the most inattentive servers.</li><li>I hate to comment negatively, but unfortunately I just could not stand the terrible service I experienced there.</li><li>The service was just WAY TOOOOO TERRIBLE! and we just told her we are not gonna eat there.</li><li>Mom and I just shifted to another Korean restaurant that was next door, experienced excellent service and food there!</li><li>Service was good, food was good.</li><li>What is n't the greatest it 's a service.</li><li>Even the service buttons that 's located at each table does not work all the time, which means you have to press the service button at least twice to get someone to help you.</li><li>Even the service buttons that 's located at each table does not work all the

service that you get.</li><li>The service was not great, you are given a bell to ring when you need service but you will need to ring it at least 2-3 times to get a waitress.</li><li>The service was not great, you are given a bell to ring when you need service but you will need to ring it at least 2-3 times to get a waitress.</li><li>It was just the service that was n't as good.</li><li>I enjoyed their food but after this terrible service, they turned me off and I will not be returning.</li><li>Another 10 minutes went by ( 20 minutes total), and wondering what was going on, my girlfriend rang the bell for service.</li><li>I pushed the bell for service.</li><li>But having already wasted enough time experiencing lousy and rude service we chose to leave.</li><li>Do n't expect overly friendly service.</li><li>Bad service Do n't even try to take out at this place They make you wait forever and they just basically treat you like you 're invisible I just ordered a simple japchae and they can take more than 30 minutes to make it Like seriously ?!</li><li>Super fast service and food, in and out restaurant.</li><li>They wo n't smile at you, and no five star service if you can live with that, but at the same time there 's no fake smile, if they are pissed you will know.</li><li>- Everything else is pretty decent- Price is good Service: 1/5 stars- I 've been here multiple times and I have been to their other locations and I can tell you that I have never experience exceptional service.</li><li>- Everything else is pretty decent- Price is good Service: 1/5 stars- I 've been here multiple times and I have been to their other locations and I can tell you that I have never experience exceptional service.</li><li>At best their service is decent but at worst ( and this is often) the staff is rude and the owners alike.</li><li>However, I have never in my life experienced such bad service.</li><li>Because of the terrible service, we did n't tip them a lot which resulted in them swearing in Korean under their breath.</li><li>As others have noted, service is somewhat lacking here.</li><li>This is my favorite korean restaurant- I would give it a 5 but the service is horrible.</li><li>Service is n't amazing but is n't horrible, waitresses are fluent in Korean and Mandarin! 1 or 2 of the waitresses are fluent in English the rest have a basic understanding.</li><li>I really enjoy dining in Nak Won, the service sucks sometimes but the food makes up for it for sure.</li><li>The service is terrible.</li><li>There 's a red button on the table to call for service.</li><li>To summarize: delicious food with crappy service.</li><li>I came to the restaurant fully expecting poor service and that is what I got.</li><li>I did notice that the service is slipping a bit, but I feel that like in most Asian restaurants, this is somewhat normal ( cheap quick food, with low service).</li><li>I did notice that the service is slipping a bit, but I feel that like in most Asian restaurants, this is somewhat normal ( cheap quick food, with low service).</li><li>The food is bland but worst of all the service is horrible.</li><li>Customer service was good and the staff were friendly.</li><li>And while service is n't the fastest, I like that they have a bell on the wall so it lets the waitstaff know I 'm ready to order or pay up.</li><li>In short, decent food but terrible horrible service.</li><li>10% 10% `` but we told her the service was bad and we do n't wanna give 10% and so the lady was saying something in korean we could n't understand.</li><li>Tips are to be given as a courtesy as good service deserve it and not an obligation.</li><li>Hired one more server but service is not amazing.</li><li>Service was inadequate though.</li><li>I mean rude much, you had crappy service and you still have the brazenness to demand us to tip more!</li><li>Service is part of the experience at a restaurant and it not just about food.</li><li>There are other restaurant that serve good food and have great service for good prices.</li><li>Decent food, awful service, not coming again.</li><li>This used to be at least a 4 1/2 star for me, every time I was in the area I 'd convince family/friends to meet me here! introduced quite a few Korean food newbies lol Their service was great and GamJaTang was really really yummy and good portions.</li><li>The service was definitely not as good as before ( I wonder if they changed cooks or owners) FINALLY, the last time that made me decide-: ( to never go back- was for my brother 's 27th birthday, there was 9 of us and they put us at the biggest table, in a semi private enclosure.</li><li>This would have been fine because they had a bell we can ring for service, except the servers seems to have a knack for ignoring it.</li><li>6. to get the bill 7. to get change for the bill The service from this lady was just horrendous, we had NINE people for dinner and we had a cake so we asked her for cutlery she brought FOUR spoons and FIVE bowls ?!?!?!?</li><li>So I 'm sad that one of my favorite staples in Young and Finch is no longer on my go-to list, but hopefully if they revamp the service and food in the future I can come back with an empty stomach ready to chow!</li><li>I 've read many reviews about this place having unexceptional service but for all the times I 've been here it was exceptional.</li><li>There 's also a button at every table to request for service instead of waving at them to get their attention.</li><li>It 's very convenient and once service is requested, you 'll be attended immediately if not, almost immediately.</li><li>Another areas is service, but I do n't think it 's the worst and most of the time they 're quick and efficient.</li><li>Pros: bottomless appetizers, gyoza ( TO DIE FOR), fast service ( although not the friendliest), bibimbap!</li><li>Service.</li><li>Usually, the waiting time for the mains feels reduced by at least fast service for the side dishes.</li><li>Super slooooow service and loud trollies!</li><li>The service and appetizers are the redeeming factor.</li><li>The service is mediocre ( usually quite slow) but the apps are plentiful and the prices cheap.</li><li>You can get a meal 100X better at Owl or elsewhere for only a slightly higher bill, plus the service is better.</li><li>Service here is quick and efficient, and you can actually ring the bell if u need assistance.</li><li>Table service button worked and attention was quick and fast.</li><li>Service was slow but the food was very good.</li><li>Very bad service.</li><li>What finally prompted me to write this review is the unacceptable level of service- so absolutely horrendous that I have no choice but to stop coming altogether.</li><li>The service at Nak Won had always been random- you never know if you would get a nice waitress or a particularly vitriolic one.</li><li>I threw in an extra dollar but it felt more like charity than an actual tip for the atrocious service.</li><li>The abundance and general quality of food may have been the saving grace but the overall terrible service and disrespect for customers marred it all.</li><li>Service is not great.</li><li>When we got service, it was curt and bordering on rude. very very bad unrespectful awful service.</li><li>When we got service, it was curt and bordering on rude. very very bad unrespectful awful service.</li><li>The service I can do without. terrible service. waitress gives attitude when asked for water and side dishes.</li><li>The restaurant is clean and service is efficient.</li><li>I recommend this place for their food and not their service ( waiters are fast, but not very friendly nor patient- I do n't know if they are burnt out or what, but they never look very happy) ...</li><li>I, for one, do n't really mind ( my focus is on the food) but keep in mind if service is important to you.</li><li>Decent place for affordable, comforting food with fairly quick service.</li><li>It takes the waitresses a while to warm up to you as a repeat customer, but all in all the service if prompt, but no smiles are offered.</li><li>Terrible service and ridiculous long wait for food.</li><li>The service is always quick, and they will always attend to your needs.</li><li>However, I do agree that a few times the service has not been up to par- once or twice, they have been quite rude in seating us, it seemed as we were being rushed.</li><li>Yep, I totally agree with all the reviews here about their bad service.</li><li>Even though the food here is pretty good I doubt I can put up with the exceptionally bad service for another visit.</li><li>To me, the service is a deal breaker in this case that prevents me from visiting again.</li><li>Service: Woot the fun part.</li><li>So they have this bell on the table which you can press to request service.</li><li>Bad food, expensive ( much of our $ 55 bbq kalbi was bone and sinew), and mandatory tip for extremely bad service.</li><li>Bad service bad food and overpriced.</li><li>The service system is great and they have on the go meals and dine in meals.</li><li>Service: Great service with a smile.</li><li>Service: Great service with a smile.</li><li>Customer service FAIL. will not be returning here and highly recommend none of you do either!</li><li>The service is extremely friendly and attentive.</li><li>Overall, this place was disappointing in flavour and in their customer service.</li><li>The food is terrific as is the service.</li><li>Service is SO slow!</li><li>Cashiers are more interested in gossiping rather than actually taking ur order and providing some service!</li><li>Food is okay but the service def takes it even further down a notch.</li><li>Definitely not worth 30 bucks especially with that kinda customer service.</li><li>Highly recommended loved it!* Value 5 Service 5 Food 5.</li><li>This sort of service is n't a common experience for a chain/ express venue and I hope it 's something that sticks with this MeVaMe location because it will keep us coming back.</li><li>Highly recommended, good staff, quick service, good food.</li><li>Service was super quick even during the busy lunch hours and the servers kindly gave you whatever sauce/dressing you wanted in a little tub.</li><li>Service was wonderful and the decor was very nice.</li><li>Friendly service.</li><li>The service was friendly and attentive as well.</li><li>Food is good, but I really appreciate the service and for the value of the food you are getting in this area, it probably is the best.</li><li>Service is awesome.</li><li>Also, they have lunch specials on the weekdays:-) The service is OK.</li><li>They seem to not care that there 's no music or just about anything beyond chairs and tables) it makes up for in portion size and good service.</li><li>Love the food and service.</li><li>I was really impressed by the quality of food and the level of service and entertainment.</li><li>The service was perfect; two very professional and friendly servers were assigned to our four tables.</li><li>They went above and beyond their call of duty to make sure all of our guests were receiving the best service possible.</li><li>It was very busy at lunch hour but the service was good, fast and friendly.</li><li>The service was excellent as it was very attentive and friendly.</li><li>I came for lunch with a friend and there were only a few other seats taken, so we had great service.</li><li>Service could have been better.</li><li>The food and service here is amazing and I keep coming back for that reason.</li><li>The prices are high compared to the surrounding deli 's but the dining room is pleasant and service fair.</li><li>The service was friendly.</li><li>Overall kabob dishes are the best bet at Zaffron and you can be assured of decent service.</li><li>Phenomenal food and service.</li><li>The service was so so and the food left a lot to desire.</li><li>The service was good and fast and the waiter was friendly.</li><li>The service is great as usual.</li><li>However, the service was slow and the waitress blamed the kitchen.</li><li>The service was slow and disrespectful.</li><li>I highly recommend avoiding this place as the service gets an F, the price gets an F, and the quality of the food was a C. Called the restaurant to ask if it is possible to make reservation for 25 people.</li><li>Its very expensive for the food and service received.</li><li>The service is always good and the food always tastes fresh.</li><li>Low quality, slow service !!!!</li><li>Pricier ... yes, and service for me depends on who is working in the kitchen.</li><li>I 've been here a few times since the location is convenient, but they do seem to struggle with service speed.</li><li>I wanted to like this place because the service is friendly but the burgers are just not any good, especially for the price.</li><li>The food took a little longer than usual to arrive, but service was good and the food is exactly what you 'd expect.</li><li>Service can be quicker.</li><li>This location is bright and updated, great service and the food was good.</li><li>If I were to rate this restaurant on quality of food alone it would be a 3/5 overall, but the consistency of the food, large portions, big menu, and excellent service keeps me coming back for more and bumps it to a 4/5.</li><li>There is new management in place and They are very friendly and the service is really good. we got house platter, pad thai, curry chicken, cashew fried rice.</li><li>Service was a bit dull and not overly courteous.</li><li>We found service to be prompt and very friendly.</li><li>Secondly, service was n't the best.</li><li>Great ambience, great service, great food.</li><li>Not the best food or the service tbh.</li><li>Bad food, bad quality, and equally bad service.</li><li>The prices are great, service friendly and quick, and while the food is n't amazing, it is always consistent.</li><li>- Good Service ?</li><li>Service is horrible, even for takeout.</li><li>The service is pretty great, and everyone is very friendly.</li><li>The service is n't fast, or slow.</li><li>Service ok but food is a disaster!</li><li>Fresh food, good quality rice, fresh seafood ( hwae/sashimi) and almost friendly service.</li><li>LOTS of selection and good service.</li><li>Service was wonderful.</li><li>Service was lacking, guess you make more money by being understaffed and squeezing as many table as fire code allows.</li><li>I came to trappers for winterlicious lunch and I found the food and service was just ok.</li><li>As for service, it was ok .. at times I felt the server felt annoyed.</li><li>With only $ 20 for a set lunch, you ca n't beat it. service was terrible. waited 45 minutes before we could stop a server and ask to order. was going to order a bottle of wine but decided not to.</li><li>They shouldnt be in the service industry. never again.</li><li>To think that that level of service and food is acceptable and that people would not venture elsewhere to blow 16 $ ..</li><li>Perhaps it was the overwhelming amount of patrons that were piling in for Winterlicious but nonetheless, the service was just terrible.</li><li>The service throughout the night only got worse.</li><li>The service overall was pretty good and I will re-visit Trapper 's again but probably not for a while, maybe Summerlicious 2012.</li><li>Service was very slow.</li><li>Service was a bit slow but it was good.</li><li>Service was good.</li><li>Loved the service and all the distinct flavors.</li><li>My only complaint is that the service is supper slow at times it seems that the wait staff forgets there running a restaurant and do n't even come by the table.</li><li>The service was friendly but dare I say discombobulated.</li><li>Pretty slow service, maki rolls have a little too much rice, and tempura rolls ( yam, green dragon, shrimp) are soggy.</li><li>I am used to eating ACYE sushi with a speedy service but this one was ridiculously slow!</li><li>We decided it was time to leave and even mentioned that we were leaving because of the slow service.</li><li>No customer should be pressured into paying any amount of tip if they believed that the service was not worth it!</li><li>The service is not fast but they ask you if everything is OK every time the server comes to your table.</li><li>Very poor service.</li><li>It has a nice an cozy atmosphere, and service can be rather slow, but I do not mind waiting as I know good food made from scratch and with love takes time.</li><li>However the quality is great and we have no complaints on the service!</li><li>Always fresh and service was friendly.</li><li>Sashimi was n't very fresh and the service was n't so good, they did n't leave any menu to re-order, and was reluctant to provide a new one.</li><li>And very slow service.</li><li>The service could be slow if you 're going with a large group.</li><li>Owned by Chinese people, service is alright, you have to try a few times before getting their attention.</li><li>The service was not very good.</li><li>The service was n't really good.</li><li>I would go back because the quality was good, I just hope that the service gets better.</li><li>He service is great and the staff is nice.</li><li>The service is always good here.</li><li>Service was awesome!</li><li>Service Charge for three people ???</li><li>Service is a bit hit or miss; the staff is pleasant, but this restaurant appears to be a small, possibly family-run business so staff sometimes gets overwhelmed.</li><li>The sashimi is n't very fresh and the service is just passable for my standards.</li><li>Only thing that I did n't really care for was the service.</li><li>I 'm very disappointed with the terribly slow service.</li><li>The service was average.</li><li>I expected improvement in their service and quality besides their redecoration as they have increased the price.</li><li>One annoying thing in their all-you-can-eat service was that they frequently forget to bring some items ( such as Sashimis) i have ordered in the menu in each round.</li><li>Pretty good price with good food and good service.</li><li>The service was good, the server attentive and ready to refill my tea and Miso Soup.</li><li>Service could be improved though.</li><li>Service here is extremely friendly.</li><li>I 've been to My Sushi several times and the one thing I will say about the service is that it 's a little inconsistent.</li><li>The service though ...</li><li>Service was good.</li><li>The service is great, the portions are filling, and the products get delivered fast to the table.</li><li>The food in general is bland, and the service is sub-par at best.</li><li>We all agreed the dim sum were decently good .. but the service here really suck !!</li><li>Service and dining room set-up caters to patrons of all ages and purposes.</li><li>The food is decent but the service really brings the whole dining experience down.</li><li>Service was bloody horrible!</li><li>I actually really enjoyed the food and the service.</li><li>Despite the reviews for the bad service ...</li><li>Very bad service and food.</li><li>Service- the attendant was not helpful at all when i was making my order.</li><li>Service was friendly and the noodles are made onsite which you know then is fresh.</li><li>Only downside is the service.</li><li>Good food, service and prices.</li><li>The service is where this place loses stars.</li><li>Anyway, there are heaps of other Portuguese chicken places that have more delicious chicken and friendlier service.</li><li>Staff are friendly, and provide good service.</li><li>The service was great and the food came out fast!</li><li>The service from all the female staff is excellent, but do n't expect a smile from the owner.</li><li>The service is slow and they are sometimes closed during their business hours which is frustrating and confusing.</li><li>However, the service was very poor.</li><li>I 'm not the type to complain but the service was very poor.</li><li>However, I find that their service can e quite bad.</li><li>They have such a nice flavor, service can be bad at some points, when it is late at night.</li><li>For best service, go during an off peak time and then the system is not that messed up.</li><li>Their food is great tasting and they have great presentation, but their service sucks.</li><li>The service is terrible for two reasons, you have to order and pay at one place and pick up in another.</li><li>The food is good but the service is sub par And there not appreciative of the customers In fact almost rude.</li><li>Service is real poor, I went there with my sister to eat all you can eat take out, and they approach us to take our bag from us.</li><li>Customer service is not that good but the food is too good but if you 're someone that the customer service affects.</li><li>Customer service is not that good but the food is too good but if you 're someone that the customer service affects.</li><li>The service was pretty good but the prices were outrageous: $ 15 for a hand roll !?!</li><li>Service was good.</li><li>But, the five dollar gift certificate that I had from not having my cleaning service come, did not work there.</li><li>Overall, between the service and the quality of the food I would skip this one.</li><li>Service: 8.5/10.</li><li>Service was incredibly slow.</li><li>Comfortable, welcoming, friendly service Price is a bit higher but you get what you pay for.</li><li>Service was excellent and the teppanyaki chefs will try to do a couple of tricks for you including the pepper shake trick and the onion volcano.</li><li>The food was delicious, the service really sucked.</li><li>Given the dollar amount of the meal, I would expect very good service.</li><li>The restaurant was half empty ... so there was really no excuse for the bad service.</li><li>Katsura would be great, and super busy if it maintained it position as a classy, quiet, high quality food and service restaurant ....</li><li>Slow but friendly service.</li><li>Service tends to not be the greatest when it 's busy, but it 's a fantastic restaurant.</li><li>Service was nice and never rushed.</li><li>Best service and friendly staff and the food was very delicious.</li><li>If the food was n't bad enough, the terrible service sealed the deal.</li><li>Service was OK as well.</li><li>Summing up: extremely overpriced, indifferent service, airport hotel atmosphere and average-at-best sushi.</li><li>The service is very slow.</li><li>Hopefully they can address the slow service and soap-tasting water and tea.</li><li>Food- 8/10 Service- 5/10 Atmosphere- 8.5/10 Value- 6/10 Overall- 7/10.</li><li>Unfortunately, they are a little pricey, the service is good but not outstanding and the food is ok compared to other Japanese fjne dining.</li><li>Waiting service was mediocre for most of the dinner ( other than the teppanyaki chef, he was awesome) but it went down hill real fast when it came to the bill.</li><li>The chefs needs a but more training to deliver much more fun during the cooking, which that 's all about this type of service.</li><li>The service is really attentive, at one point we had three people serving us, even the chef came out to say hello!</li><li>The food &amp; service does n't compare to the personal service you received from one of the owners ( Larry) who cooked and served with a smile.</li><li>The food &amp; service does n't compare to the personal service you received from one of the owners ( Larry) who cooked and served with a

service.</li><li>Rating: Service: 4/5 Food Quality: 3/5 Comfort N/A Decor 2/5 Value: 3/5 Parking: 4/5.</li><li>I can certainly see why others have complained about poor customer service.</li><li>The service was just way down there.</li><li>Service has always been quite pleasant.</li><li>I wonder if you gave the workers attitude too, that is why you did n't get the service that you deserve.</li><li>Being a filipino I am mostly disgusted in the service and the attitude of the owner and the workers.</li><li>Only way you 'll get service is if You open your mouth demand For service or ask where the proper line up is ....</li><li>Only way you 'll get service is if You open your mouth demand For service or ask where the proper line up is ....</li><li>Like I said, I do n't look it and Got the worst service in my life.</li><li>If my mom went in, I 'm sure they would be kissing her behind with excellent Service.</li><li>Even so, my BF who looked it Got the worst service of his life and will never return.</li><li>If you do n't want to be irritated with the long wait and bad service I suggest not To go.</li><li>Food is terrible in flavour and quality, service is so-so instead of being perfect.</li><li>Terrible service.</li><li>My gf has also received the same service.</li><li>This place may be near by but I 'd rather travel for better service.</li><li>As far as customer service and dine in experience goes, well it will all depend on what you expect.</li><li>Service was prompt.</li><li>But recently they have changed management and staff and have to say I am incredibly disappointed with the service.</li><li>The service was soooo slow, impolite staff, and the food was uncooked.</li><li>Nice service.</li><li>I have a bunch of issues with this Pizza Hut location, primarily having to do with their service.</li><li>As if this is premium customer service on their part.</li><li>Great service.</li><li>Great food and great service.</li><li>Their breakfast choices are super yummy- nice atmosphere, really good service.</li><li>This location has good service, good food, and an awesome patio.</li><li>Service was friendly and relatively quick AT THE START.</li><li>Pros: Food and service were decent.</li><li>The service was great because we were the only table there which is the case most of the time ...</li><li>The atmosphere and decor are great here along with the service.</li><li>Once my entire group arrived, that waiter came by our table to apologize for the slow service.</li><li>However, the slow service was a bit annoying, as a few of us had meetings in the morning we had to get back to work for.</li><li>Really enjoyed the food, as well as the service provided by Sarah and a gentleman ( who I did n't catch the name: P).</li><li>I 've only been there for breakfasts, and there is always excellent service in the mornings and great food!</li><li>Service was impeccable, food and drinks amazing.</li><li>Overall, really enjoyed myself, and I believe if you enjoy selection, great desserts, fantastic service, and a HUGE, I mean HUGE alcohol selection ...</li><li>The food was good, the restaurant 's ambience was great, beautifully decorated, and the service was great!</li><li>Good service.</li><li>Service was n't all that great, as our server did n't seem to want to be there.</li><li>This is the third Symposium Cafe I 've been to and service has always been an issue.</li><li>Service is always so slow!</li><li>I 'd prefer to not go back but somehow my friends usually choose to meet at a Symposium Cafe for brunch- likely for convenience of location vs the food and service.</li><li>Way to throw the restaurant under the bus, so not only was her service terrible but I now know the restaurant does n't know how to handle Sunday brunch.</li><li>Overall, I thought the service was pretty good.</li><li>The place was more than sufficiently staffed, however the service was horrendously terrible.</li><li>The quality of food was as bad as the service.</li><li>The service is great and the food is really good, especially for the price.</li><li>Amazing Service and Amazing staff Great setting, great everything, I 've only been once, but I can already say that we will be frequenting this spot as often as we can!</li><li>Great decor, good service BUT had better food: 1.</li><li>Food quality is 3.5 and service is 4.</li><li>The staff were very nice, the service was great. i had icecream parfait and it was nothing special.</li><li>The service was awful.</li><li>The best thing about this chain of cafes is the top-notch service from everyone, even if it 's a busy day or stressed.</li><li>Decent meals w. decent service and decent prices.</li><li>One star for okay service.</li><li>Food was good but service was lacking.</li><li>Service is impeccable.</li><li>Upon walking through the doors we were seated immediately by the owner which I thought was excellent service.</li><li>He truly did not miss a thing and gave us excellent customer service.</li><li>Overall this restaurant has good food, service, and is conveniently located for those who live in the area and are looking to eat/drink in walking distance.</li><li>The food tasted as it always does .... but I 'll figure something else out next time! what is the deal with this mcdonalds ? i only go here because sometimes i work really late and its around the corner from my shop. they have the slowest service out of all mcdonalds ive ever been to. and on top of that, which i find ridiculous, they also charge more than other mcdonalds .. how ??? and when you get your order of fries, they NEVER fill it up, its always HALF. the food tastes as you would expect, but this place must be struggling financially to charge more than other mcdonalds, and only fill your fries HALF of what you should get. if you dont mind getting ripped off, then go here, otherwise go to the mconalds on keele just south of lawrence.</li><li>The ingredients were fresh, the taste was delicious, and the service was very friendly.</li><li>The portions are a good size, and the service is very good.</li><li>The service was okay, nothing special.</li><li>The service was slow and when they asked how the food was, I told them the ribs were not easy to eat and too hard, they told me it 's because of the cut .... did n't offer to comp since I only touched one, or apologize either.</li><li>The service was impeccable and fast.</li><li>For those who care about service ( I do n't), it 's fine.</li><li>The service was less than average and the wait staff seemed like they did n't like their jobs.</li><li>Memphis Style 's food sucks, and their service sucks.</li><li>On the bright side the service was really good and the one server working the patio was really quick and very helpful.</li><li>I 'll be back. maybe it 's just me but some of the stinkiest Asian foods out there always tend to have strong but tasty flavours to it. eventually u just get use to the smell but man this bean paste type soup is always welcome in my stomach. although the bowl ( $ 10) with rice does not appear very big it does fill you for a lunch meal. as mentioned in other reviews the service was good. def be back for lunch again soon. fantastic samgyeopsal !!!!!! although the price is a bit more expensive than other korean restaurant, the quality is not comparable. best quality for its price. the owner is super nice and his english is really good. he 's a fun person to talk too. the place is quite small but its never packed ( everytime when i visited).</li><li>I 'd come back because the service is wonderful- maybe I 'll give the table top cooking items a shot next time!</li><li>On the other hand, service was frustrating ( and that 's an understatement).</li><li>He eventually disappeared towards the end of our meal and it went from over-service to completely lack of service.</li><li>The service was good.</li><li>Great service and tasty food!</li><li>The latter is what you need to know about:- Service is paced and patient ( vs. rushed with grunts, bells, and finger pointing ... you know what i 'm talking about).</li><li>Service: The lady who served us happily answered any questions we had and offered some suggestions.</li><li>It surely has the best service for customers.</li><li>Even when their busy- their service is still 100%.</li><li>Overall the service is amazing and the food is filling and delicious!</li><li>Packed and busy because of it and services slows down as a result, but the owner is a true caring man who takes time to deliver personalized service, recommendation and assistance.</li><li>He 's so friendly and give the best service even if you do n't speak Korean.</li><li>Good food, but even better service.</li><li>I know hard to believe, good service in Canada ?!</li><li>The service is friendly as the owner is the one who handles the wait duties.</li><li>Service is friendly, food is quick and always so delicious.</li><li>I might be over looked since I have n't had anything for 10 hours before I stepped in: P The restaurant is a little bit small since they have no window, but service was remarkable.</li><li>The service needs improvement as all the waiters/waitresses seem to work on their own.</li><li>The food is good- 4 stars The service- 3 stars Clean and tidy- 4 stars Bathroom- I have n't checked.</li><li>Fresh cooked to order and friendly service.</li><li>As for service, the service is probably the factor where they lose stars.</li><li>As for service, the

everyone was super nice and friendly.</li><li>Great food and good service at a reasonable cost.</li><li>This little gem is definitely worth the drive, I would love to keep it my little secret, but the food, atmosphere, &amp; service is too good to not share!</li><li>Nice decor and excellent and attentive service.</li><li>Nice interior with great food and good service.</li><li>Service and food is great.</li><li>The food was good and the service was good too.</li><li>Service was standard.</li><li>The service was mediocre, she took out orders accurately and was able to split bills quickly.</li><li>Though there was not many people at the restaurant, and the service was still slow.</li><li>The service is quite fast, and the servers are very welcoming and friendly.</li><li>The prices however, are slightly on the pricier side, but with the great food, service, and ambience, I found it worth it.</li><li>Service 4/5 Fast and attentive.</li><li>Clean and friendly service!</li><li>The service was good, the atmosphere intimate with nice instrumental music playing in the back ground.</li><li>Service was beautifully polite and non-intrusive.</li><li>The service was notably accommodating too, considering we came very close to their closing time at 10:30.</li><li>The service is quick.</li><li>Great decor, solid service and superb quality sushi.</li><li>Staff is unpleasant service is slow and they never offer compliments for waiting customers Too be because the food is actually good.</li><li>The service is always incredible with fun people ready to get you whatever you need or might be missing.</li><li>TL; DR service was terrible, menu confusing, wings n fries still awesome!</li><li>What I do like about this location is the service and the atmosphere.</li><li>The service on the day I was there was pretty good for a full house, they were attentive, especially to empty glasses sitting at our table, asking if we wanted more water, or beer.</li><li>Nothing beats oven baked wings, hot fries, and* excellent* service every time.</li><li>Love the fries Wings are decent Prompt and kind service Nice decor Several televisions.</li><li>The service is truly terrible, terrible, terrible.</li><li>It 's two start because service was non-existent.</li><li>Been to other locations and service was great.</li><li>Overall, I like their environment and service ... their wings are great too! give it a try when u stop by !! =).</li><li>They are nice people, but do n't expect good service on Tuesdays, and specially in the summer, prepare for a 45 minute line up.</li><li>Their service is decently prompt.</li><li>Sports pub vibe, large screen TV 's, friendly staff and speedy service.</li><li>Better food, and always better service, elsewhere.</li><li>Terrible service.</li><li>Nothing wrong with the service.</li><li>Service, food and atmosphere Amazing!</li><li>Good service.</li><li>I said fine, but i was bitter at their poor service.</li><li>The servers there knew we could n't leave them any kind of decent tip so they did n't bother with us, and we did n't bother with them .. at least, I thought it was just because we were young and lacked money that the service was terrible ..</li><li>The service at this Yonge/ ( north of) Sheppard location is just as bad as I remembered it.</li><li>No wait, the service IS terrible.</li><li>I do n't think I 've EVER seen anyone smile there, and service means a lot to me.</li><li>Really fast service and a good portion of wings.</li><li>From her customer service, I would return to The Lounge in the future.</li><li>Service was really good, the waitresses came by to check on us and refill any drinks we needed.</li><li>Loved the food and the service just dislike the seating arrangement.</li><li>I absolutely love this bar, it 's got great service and is always a good time to hang out with friends to grab a few drinks.</li><li>This St Louis is like every other St Louis out there since it is a franchise but the service here is FANTASTIC and very friendly.</li><li>The environment, service and popularity of this place makes it the bar to be in the area.</li><li>The service of the place seemed average along with the atmosphere.</li><li>Nothing really blew me away with service but being such a busy location I guess they do n't really have to.</li><li>Good place, solid food and good service we go there a lot for UFC nights but try to go to the bar upstairs much better atmosphere than the ground floor, better service and even the food.</li><li>Good place, solid food and good service we go there a lot for UFC nights but try to go to the bar upstairs much better atmosphere than the ground floor, better service and even the food.</li><li>We were at the National this Saturday with friends and had an awesome time: delicious food, friendly service, great live music ( all night long !!!), and a wonderful surprise of a Las Vegas style show, which was mouth dropping.</li><li>The wait times are a bit longer than other steak places and they often have poor service due to short staffed shifts during dinner rush.</li><li>The service here is friendly and they try to be nice but the main server that I always see ( older moustached gentleman) ca n't hide his impatience and is a bit condescending when you ask about menu items.</li><li>I 'll likely forget about the meal I had here as there was n't anything truly exquisite about the flavour, service or ambiance.</li><li>Always friendly service and well executed dishes in a dated but comfortable environment, this place will be missed ( especially the pickles).</li><li>Service was different every time.</li><li>The service was as well.</li><li>The service is tops, and it has a real family run business vibe.</li><li>Service was excellent and the food was terrible.</li><li>You dont find service like this anymore so I was pretty impressed.</li><li>This isnt your fancy steak resturant so the price isnt too high compared to other steak resturant and the service is superb.</li><li>The service was alright.</li><li>The service is n't bad despite what everyone says, yes, they do gossip in Chinese but when they serve me, they are also nice and bring me what I ask for.</li><li>I`m giving it 1.5 stars because the service was decent but the food and atmosphere could be improved ( the place looked old and not well kept).</li><li>Always seating for small and big groups The service is good not long wait ..</li><li>Their food and service sucks.</li><li>The service has always been iffy, but it was really terrible today.</li><li>Customer service is adequate and the ambiance is inviting for large groups.</li><li>Service was slow, it 's a pretty large venue, lots of lighting and red/gold decor.</li><li>Granted, I 've never experienced the horrific food or service that everyone else seems to agree on.</li><li>Maybe it 's because I frequent much sketchier Chinese joints often, but I 've never had found anything to complain about with the service.</li><li>The service was COLD and rude as the waiter just barges in to drop our food off without a smile or a word.</li><li>Is there a new trend towards expensive crappy food with bad service ?</li><li>Service was pretty lousy, but I counted 4 servers in a big, busy restaurant, so whatevs.</li><li>We do n't come for the service but we do n't have to wait for a seat during the Sunday lunch hour so it 's bearable.</li><li>Mediocore food and terrible service.</li><li>The service has a lot to be desired and the food is okay.</li><li>Service was good, not exceptional, but adequate.</li><li>Worst service ever.</li><li>It sad when staff do n't care about the quality of their service and it reflects badly on the restaurant.</li><li>Had better, service is alright though, quality is good but portion is small.</li><li>Food was OK but the service left much to be desired.</li><li>The quality of the food is mediocre but passable, the service is awful but if you 're lucky you 'll get a teppanyaki chef that will put on a good show for your group.</li><li>It 's one thing to have bad service, but it 's another when you have to ask 10 times for the servers to bring you the food that you ordered.</li><li>Atmosphere was nice and quiet, service was decent, waiters were pretty friendly and helpful.</li><li>I did n't find the service to be all that bad, I mean it 's not a fine dining restaurant by any means ...</li><li>Service was n't lacking at all, even though the restaurant was plenty busy at noon on a Saturday.</li><li>In terms of service, the service was mediocre.</li><li>In terms of service, the service was mediocre.</li><li>They were n't bad nor did they go out of their way to go the extra mile to make service excellent.</li><li>Also, the service was slow, even though we had four different servers for our table.</li><li>Overall, the food is okay, the service is slow, the servers are unorganized and the place can get loud and crowded.</li><li>Was there last night, the service was atrocious and I did n't even get the second half of my meal.</li><li>I gotta note, the service is pretty so-so, or annoying or bad sometimes.</li><li>The rolls look fresh and service is ok.</li><li>Amazing food, great prices, good service ... arranged a group of 12 people, and they were very accommodating.</li><li>The workers in the restaurant took to the same attention to service like worker bees in a hive!</li><li>Friendly and fast service.</li><li>I went to Tako with my cousin for dinner last night and did n't exactly get the greatest service.</li><li>Unfortunately, it was kinda chaotic in there on a Monday night! so much so that service was a bit slow and inefficient.</li><li>The food was passable, nothing special, and the service was friendly but terrible.</li><li>Spoke to two managers about the terrible service and was simply offered `` a promotion next time we come in!''. ha.</li><li>Most of the time they get the correct order, but usually it 's a fairly slow service where most waiters speak little English.</li><li>The food is cheap, but the service lacks a lot.</li><li>I thought this place would be different from its new Mississauga location, which I have been to, and was not impressed with the service.</li><li>More importantly, the service.</li><li>Our food was also served with a side of Appalling Service.</li><li>The young male waiters would chatter between Mandarin and Cantonese and seem to have no sense of what good service means; do n't expect thank you 's or any polite nods.</li><li>Read the reviews which were really mixed and we walked in expecting crappy service but wanted Wimpy 's Breakfast ... we wo n't be back.</li><li>Our waitress with short hair was actually really nice and had good service and very friendly.</li><li>The place is extremely dirty, the food is questionably and definitely microwaved, and the servers did n't have their customer service training.</li><li>The service here has really taken a turn for the worst, our so called `` waitress'' had a horrible attitude the way she talked to us &amp; those other customers around us, was ridiculious &amp; the service as a whole was just plain slow &amp; bad.</li><li>The service here has really taken a turn for the worst, our so called ``

's great &amp; what can once more, is Fantastic food, service &amp; the feeling of being in a happy 50 's diner !!!!</li><li>Delicious, gigantic burgers and friendly service.</li><li>Good service and good food.</li><li>Typical diner- good food and very good service.</li><li>That is seamless service to a customer concern.</li><li>The food and service was also great from our waitress.</li><li>The

fast.</li><li>Plenty of food, decent price and prompt service.</li><li>It 's a diner, portions are great but do n't expect a 5 star restaurants service.</li><li>The service is typically above average.</li><li>Good food, service and vibes.</li><li>Service.</li><li>Service and ambiance is top notch.</li><li>The service was good initially but they brought one member of our group the wrong order and did nothing to remedy the situation.</li><li>Cheaper, better food, and better service.</li><li>The service sucks!</li><li>For a fancy and expensive restaurant, I expect a higher customer service level and this place did n't achieve it.</li><li>Service is certainly not as friendly and warm as before.</li><li>The service was what you would expect from an old school steakhouse.</li><li>Top notch service.</li><li>Service was very nice and serving was n't too slow.</li><li>As for service, if the senior citizens working there are happy doing what they do, I figured I should just be thankful and enjoy the impeccable services that result from their years ' of experience.</li><li>It 's the type of spot that older people would love- very traditional- but the service, ambiance and decor make it a perfect date spot.</li><li>Service was excellent.</li><li>However, they lose stars from me because of poor service.</li><li>However, service was extremely mediocre.</li><li>They pretty much handed us our bill in the middle of a conversation we were having and as soon as we paid our bill, they stopped all their service altogether.</li><li>In any case, although the food was good, it 's not like I ca n't get that same quality somewhere else in Toronto ( that also has great service).</li><li>I really also hope they take these reviews into serious consideration because I 'm reading other people 's reviews and clearly, I 'm not the only one who is unhappy with their service.</li><li>Terrible Service!</li><li>The waiter was professional and the service was top notch!</li><li>Although the reason for the rating to be 2 was due to the service at the David Duncan House.</li><li>I do not appreciate the service there and will definitely not be returning.</li><li>Service was not the best.</li><li>Service was pretty mediocre for the bill coming up to $ 300 for two.</li><li>The service is also very good.</li><li>Not to put down any of the other reviews here, but this place is definitely overrated for the decor, service and $ $ $ $.</li><li>New owners apparently and it is evident, will not be returning after horrid experience Medium well filet came medium rare, took 30 mins to get waiter to cook some more and than half came well done other half still medium rare Presentation was better but food quality, cooking and service down a notch, previously my favourite restaurant but I will never return Thanks for the memories old owners.</li><li>Professional service.</li><li>The service was great, waiter was very attentive and there was complimentary coat check.</li><li>The SERVICE here is amazing! everyone is very very detail oriented! and that 's what makes the experience here such a wonderful experience, and keeps us coming back! thank you!</li><li>I have been a regular at the Duncan House for years and have always loved their food, service, and the overall atmosphere.</li><li>Service is still top-rate.</li><li>I went for Valentines dinner tonight and the service was not the same.</li><li>It 's common courtesy for your customers that are spending top dollar to have top service.</li><li>Again, I have been going there from a decade ago and the service has gone downhill big time.</li><li>The mansion has tons of seating ( well duh, it 's a mansion) and you 're always treated to the best of service, as it 's an upscale establishment.</li><li>My bf had taken me to David Duncan House for a surprise anniversary dinner, and I was very impressed with the excellent service, quality of dishes, and the beautiful appearance of the outside as well as the warm and intimate ambiance inside.</li><li>Service was impolite and ill-informed.</li><li>Service was extremely poor.</li><li>If our service and food was so poor on a slow night, can you even fathom a busy night ?</li><li>Also for a `` fine dining'' venue the service is a complete fail.</li><li>The service is perfect.</li><li>The venue has a classy vintage feel with ample parking. the setting is very nice, calamari was chewy, steak was overcooked, service was slow and unprofessional, dessert was great. would not return.</li><li>I was planning on giving him 1 $ bc that 's literally how bad the service was, but I could n't find it so i just gave him 2 $ and he was like no, 3 $ more.</li><li>I do n't recommend this place for their crap service ( a woman was serving us too while she was eating her mouth full).</li><li>It was clean and service was fast and prompt.</li><li>1.5 stars Service is good.</li><li>Pros: good service ( was n't too busy) variety of appetizers and good hotpot Cons: no major cons but food took some time.</li><li>For service, it is almost nonexistent but it is what it is for most Korean restaurants so not applicable for me.</li><li>Their service is OK, not the best.</li><li>The food was terrible and the service was really bad.</li><li>Service is friendly and prompt.</li><li>Service: Despite having a call button, there were only 3 waiters so we had to keep reminding them to bring us water and food/drinks that we ordered.</li><li>The food was great, but the service could be a lot better.</li><li>Service was n't too bad, but they did n't seem to have enough servers working.</li><li>The service was polite and friendly.</li><li>I will not come back again for the lackluster service and over charging compared to menu pricing.</li><li>Overall the service was a-ok.</li><li>The food has always been decent, service was always subpar and there have been a few occasions where issues like `` you need to order a certain amount of table bbq to eat here'' happened, though this `` rule'' seems to be inconsistent.</li><li>Do n't eat here unless you want horrible service, and to get overcharged on your bill, or forced to pay twice.</li><li>For these kind of service, I am not leaving them any tips.</li><li>There is always that one place that no matter how bad the service or how inconvenient the parking situation is, you still keep going back.</li><li>Now I am not saying the service is horrible, I 've had great service here before, but it is hit or miss. Now on to the important part; the foodizzle.</li><li>Now I am not saying the service is horrible, I 've had great service here before, but it is hit or miss.

angle.</li><li>Service- The absolute worst service i have ever received in my life from every angle.</li><li>My hubby gave a $ 20 bill and as there 's not much service, so I 'm thinking whether to

it is a bit less barnlike and the service was nicer.</li><li>The service was ok ... it looked like they hired a lot of new people ( they had Trainee badges on) and were always accompanied by a trained

here among the most efficient in any Chinese restaurant, and the staff are as professional as they come.</li><li>Portions are enormous and service is efficient.</li><li>Just like you would in a diner,

and this is because they give huge portions for an affordable price, and service is very quick.</li><li>I 've also had times where a server would check up on my table, which is what I call a `` rare event'' because Chinese restaurants are usually very poor in service.</li><li>Service is not great, but it 's a Chinese restaurant, what can you expect ?</li><li>Out of all the Congee Wong 's, this is the best because of the quality of their food and service.</li><li>It 's been awhile since I dined in at the restaurant, so I ca n't really say much about the service.</li><li>Would have to say this time they were better at the service.</li><li>Better service this time around from the nice waiter.</li><li>All the food came out super fast though service in general was n't the best ( had to ask multiple times for soy sauce and boxes).</li><li>Service was pretty bad.</li><li>The food is delicious but the service is n't the greatest.</li><li>The service is fast.</li><li>Service is meh, but you do n't go for the service ... grab take-out otherwise.</li><li>Service is meh, but you do n't go for the service ... grab take-out otherwise.</li><li>Do n't expect top notch service as they are the quick and efficient type.</li><li>The congee is also excellent, and the service fast and pleasant, in view of the crowding.</li><li>Some other observations we had were that, like many Chinese restaurants in North America, the service was quick and swift, but not extremely friendly.</li><li>The service is pretty standard for a busy Chinese restaurant ( i.e. do n't come looking for great service).</li><li>The service is pretty standard for a busy Chinese restaurant ( i.e. do n't come looking for great service).</li><li>This place never disappoints, service is quick and easy, everyone understands at least three languages ( English, Mandarin, Cantonese) and the food portion sizes are excellent.</li><li>Service is fast and friendly, the décor is contemporary, inviting and clean and the food here is very fresh and flavorful and the portions are generous.</li><li>Quick service but no discount when paying in cash.</li><li>The service here is real quick and it makes for quick turnaround dining because people always seem to be in and out.</li><li>Service is okay, but could be a lot better.</li><li>What horrible customer service ... at least they could have had a voicemail indicating that they are renovating until further notice ... anyhow ... not so pleased ...</li><li>The portions are still large as well and the service still extremely fast.</li><li>Great food, good service and a clean open style restaurant.</li><li>The service was really good ( and the waitress use their own form of sign language to communicate with one another rather than shouting across the restaurant) and they were so helpful in getting my boyfriend 's grandparents situated at the table with their wheelchairs.</li><li>Fast and friendly service, delicious food.</li><li>Other than that service is friendly and efficient, so it is ok to drop by for a late night snack or quick lunch, but my heart remains set on Congee Queen as it is really the queen of my congee.</li><li>Very quick and efficient service!</li><li>Service is so so here.</li><li>There 's almost always a lineup, but service is fast and efficient.</li><li>The receptionist does n't really have a customer service oriented attitude, but I did n't expect so.</li><li>Do n't expect high level of service but the food is banged out at a super fast pace.</li><li>Service was good but was n't impressed by the food.</li><li>Their service is also good.</li><li>Service is crap like most asian places but I know when I go to asian places I 'm not expecting service and neither should you.</li><li>Service was not so good.</li><li>The waitresses know me as a regular, and yet the consistently the apathetic quality of service never fails to frustrate me.</li><li>On this last visit however, I do n't know if it was because they were super busy or what but the service was bad tonight.</li><li>If I had to rate just this visit, I would give it a 3 because of service.</li><li>That being said, the food was still just fantastic and I know that usually, the service is better.</li><li>I 've been here a couple times hoping the next thing I ordered would taste better than the last ( and that the service would improve- they treat you like they are doing YOU a huge favour).</li><li>However, the service is terrible, the people behind the counter are rude and generally could careless if people came in or not.</li><li>Their service is sucky .. indifferent and borderline rude, especially from any of the females.</li><li>Service is n't great, so I recommend not staying there, just do take out.</li><li>Mediocre service.</li><li>Service is quick and the food arrived quickly too.</li><li>Their service ( or lack thereof) has now been CONSISTENTLY very poor!</li><li>Feb visit #2- Service very slow.</li><li>Jan visit #1- Excellent service.</li><li>The service is not that great.</li><li>In terms of service, I find the servers have a bit of an attitude.</li><li>The service, was decent enough.</li><li>But the service is not so good, the people there are not that friendly.</li><li>Their service, although not horrible, was not particularly great and had they not already slapped a 15% gratuity on their bill, I would not have given that at all.</li><li>The service is decent when you go later in the evening for just desserts.</li><li>It was good ( strawberry) but the reason why it 's one star is 100% service.</li><li>We all expect sub par service at Asian restaurants but this was just next level.</li><li>Since that 's not my thing, I ca n't really give them a high rating, the experience and the service is not that great.</li><li>Although the decor got an update, the people and service have not changed.</li><li>Otherwise, the decor was blah, the ambience meh and service okay ...</li><li>The service here is usually good and the staff are really friendly.</li><li>Cakes are good, but service is bad!</li><li>The service is friendly and the food is very decent.</li><li>The food is average and service is average.</li><li>The staff did not seem to care about their lack of service, nor did management.</li><li>Your food and drink prices are too expensive for what you are serving, and if you continue on with the lack of service, pretty soon, your competition will over take you.</li><li>I 'm sure I 'm not the only one here who feels this way about your poor service.</li><li>Cakes 4 Star Service 1- 3 Star ( depending who you get) Dining 3 Star Randomly located on Finch Avenue in a 1 level small strip plaza one wonders who on earth would come here for cake.</li><li>Which gives me a vibe that this place is run by some snobberish foodie. ( not a bad thing unless it becomes more snobberish than the latter) The service as other reviewers have mentioned is grade a Snotty.</li><li>The staff here has a VERY authentic HK ( Hong Kong) charm and customer service.</li><li>With service like his it feels more like I 'm walking in to a cheap Chinese diner than a bakery where I 've been treated far better.</li><li>Despite the bad service the cakes here are good.</li><li>Please do yourself a service and come for the cake and try to limit your interactions with the Man in dark rimmed glasses cause he 's a bit of a buzz kill.</li><li>I had dinner here- it was pretty good and the service I received was also pretty good.</li><li>The service ... they mean well, but it 's terrible.</li><li>Service was decent.</li><li>This place does n't have thE best bagels in the world, but there are a few key items which are fantastic- combined with friendly and polite counter service.</li><li>We wo n't be going back for substandard food and extremely poor service.</li><li>I 'd rather take my hard earned money elsewhere for more attentive service and better quality food.</li><li>The service is fantastic!</li><li>3.5/5, + .5 for service.</li><li>Service was fantastic, and to my huge surprise, very quick for an Italian restaurant.</li><li>I say that because the service was VERY slow and there were only 2 other tables in the entire place.</li><li>The service was good.</li><li>Service was great.</li><li>Worst service ever and the food was mediocre.</li><li>The service here is a bit on the slow side- I think they are going for an unhurried vibe, but at times we had to call them over for routine things like keeping water topped up.</li><li>Service was very strange on the particular night I went.</li><li>Service looked like maybe the manager was not around, and these guys ( about 4 of them working) did not want to be there.</li><li>So, here 's the good, bad and the ugly: The good: The lady taking the order was courteous, pleasent and nice. ( as one must be in the service industry) What I liked though is the she was willing to accommodate my request to change one item from their combo-I wanted to try their butter chicken instead of the lamb kadai gosht.</li><li>Find something else. went there with a friend for lunch, it was buffet. the place was quite small but with a lot of places to sit! they have large tables too! the service was great, fast and friendly people. the buffet include: one soup 2 or 3 salad options many dips and sauces 1 rice 3-4 kind of vegetable dishes 5-6 meat dishes ( include chicken, lamb, beef, shrimps) they also have bread ( nan) and appetizers ( could not remember the names) they also have desserts ( 2 kinds) and fruits the taste was very good and not too spicy, however they have really extreme spicy sauces! the price was around 10 dollars as a neighborhood restaurant it one of the best options in the area and for sure I 'll be back:).</li><li>It started with the service, which was slow and it seemed that I was more of a problem then a guest in their establishment.</li><li>Not the fastest service but acceptable.</li><li>The service was also great and I like how they bring you an appetizer when you first arrive.</li><li>The service was okay pretty standard.</li><li>Service can be slow and the waiters are not always on the ball, but they are polite.</li><li>The service is very friendly.</li><li>The service was fast and the restaurant looks neat.</li><li>Service is always great.</li><li>They work hard for their service.</li><li>All in all, food was good but price and service left something to be desired.</li><li>Service a little slow ( particularly at end of meal), but the food itself was sublime.</li><li>The service here is great.</li><li>Service is always friendly and portions are huge ..</li><li>Service was quick, staff was friendly and food was delicious.</li><li>The atmosphere is quite old and the service is fine.</li><li>Fast friendly service.</li><li>Service does n't change, always excellent!</li><li>The service was quick, efficient, and servers were really friendly!</li><li>The service was prompt and professional.</li><li>Amazing food, outstanding &amp; quick service, warm atmosphere, great management, and everyone I 've brought here has been pleased by how great of a restaurant this is overall.</li><li>It 's not just about service or price.</li><li>Everything about this place met all my expectations: great service, wonderful ambience, and delicious food.</li><li>Great breakfast and great service!</li><li>Fast service and a smile.</li><li>Good food. great service.</li><li>Was greeted really nicely and the service was extremely fast and proficient.</li><li>The service is and always is excellent.</li><li>I believe the restaurant is family owned, and the waitresses are all very nice ladies with very good customer service skills.</li><li>Great food, great prices and great service!</li><li>Highly recommended! my go to breakfast place. great atmosphere, awesome food and great friendly service ... if you like all day breakfast 's, go to the valley, you wo n't be dissappointed!</li><li>The service is quick and friendly too, the only thing is that they close at 3pm and sometimes I do n't have time to go for lunch before then.</li><li>Service was very fast and friendly.</li><li>Quick service!</li><li>Very consistent with service and food.</li><li>The service is always friendly and quick.</li><li>Beautiful place and fast service.</li><li>Always treated like family and service is fast and friendly But yes the place gets packed on the weekend, but it 's worth the wait.</li><li>Homey atmosphere, good service, good food, good value for your money.</li><li>The service was really fast and friendly; it seemed that a lot of the customers were regulars.</li><li>A hearty recommendation for anyone looking for good food and service at a good price.</li><li>Service is a bit a slow but friendly.</li><li>The service was slow but that 's because a big group came and they only had 2 servers running the show.</li><li>The service here can be inconsistent, with certain servers going absentee at times ( e.g. not refilling water or bringing cutlery), though it 's likely due to their being understaffed.</li><li>I really liked their service, it was simply great.</li><li>Service is slow here, but the staff has always been very warm and friendly.</li><li>The service is quick and ramen is amazing as well!</li><li>They have authentic okonomiyaki that they make fresh and serve on a sizzling platter with all the fixings. their gyoza is fresh and cooked to perfection. their takoyaki ( round pancake balls with a piece of octopus) is authentic and fresh too. less soup base options to ajisen, but if you find the equivalent here, you should find that it is less salty, less msg. being korean run, seeing any kimchi or pickled radish actually makes sense, and i think there is kalbi ( korean beef short ribs) on the menu as well. their service is not fast, and this place can be quite busy at times, but if you want ramen and you are not downtown on dundas or queen street, this is the best ramen you can get. i can vouch for the quality and consistency of this particular location, dunno about other Kenzo locations. i miss the tempura they used to have at this location, but it was taken off the menu. if you want an authentic bowl of ramen or okonomiyaki that is the closest thing to getting to Japan and having one there, this is the place if you are uptown.</li><li>Staff are very nice and service is quick.</li><li>Service here is nice and friendly.</li><li>Rating: Service: 4/5 Food Quality: 4/5 Comfort 3/5 Decor 3/5 Value: 3/5 Parking: 4/5.</li><li>The ramen was just okay, nothing to write home about, however, the service was dismal.</li><li>Anyway, given the poor service, I will not go back.</li><li>Service was good, but not very quick.</li><li>However, the service is pretty terrible.</li><li>The service at this Sheppard location is quite attentive, always coming by to refill your water and keeping up with greetings.</li><li>This is a favorite new ramen places, thought I wish they had vegetarian options. food okay, service horrible. waited over half an hour to get food at 2:00 in the afternoon.</li><li>Okay food, no service at all.</li><li>Great, friendly, and attentive service.</li><li>Service here is n't always the best, but that 's pretty typical of Asian restaurants.</li><li>Food- 5/5 Service- take out but 5/5 Ambiance- 2/5 Price to value ratio: 4.5/5. soft bread, crispy bacons, shredded crispy lettuce, huge size .. very good price, for such a nice sandwich, turkey bacon is my favorite, it going to be a regular lunch place for me for sure!</li><li>They do have a bank machine with an annoying service charge for using it.</li><li>Do n't expect any service, though the owner who is usually behind the counter is always friendly, but expect a simple well made submarine sandwich.</li><li>Memories! back in high school my friends and i used to driver over here to grab lunch, the place has n't changed one bit:) i always order the Bacon Combo but make sure you ask for GRAVY! that 's a secret tip. what makes this sub so good ? everything! all the small details they add. the bread is nice and soft, lettuce shredded, bacon super crispy, and the friendly service you get everytime. they always make you laugh or smile.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
