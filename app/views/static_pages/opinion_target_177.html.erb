available.</li><li>I asked for extra soy sauce and they gave us 4 packets.</li><li>Ordered: Gae-Jang ( marinated raw crab) 2/5* Plate of marinated crab for $ 12.99* You can order soy sauce based or spicy sauce based* I ordered soy sauce based Gae Jang* Basically you get 2 small crabs all cracked up* Soy sauce marinade was decent but a little too sweet* What turned me off from this is how the crabs did n't taste very fresh* Although it is marinated, because you are eating this raw- freshness is quite important* My mouth felt a little dry/tough after eating this and it was n't very pleasant* The claw part was n't cracked and there was no way I could break it with my teeth* I was quite disappointed with this dish since I was looking forward to it Ordered: CheolPan JjooGgooMi ( baby squid stir fry) 5/5* Baby squid stir fried with vegetables and ricecake for two people at $ 19.99* This was recommended by my friend who 's had it before* It 's meant for 2 people and cooked at your table* This is very spicy ( be aware !!)* It came with lots of baby squid, ricecakes and vegetables* Sauce was very intense in flavor ( spices) and it was good to eat with rice* I thought it was kind of odd how they had broccoli in it* I loved this dish and would go back just for it Complimentary: Kong Bi Ji* This is a grinded up bean paste that people like to eat with the rice* I am not a big fan of beans .... or grinded up beans so I did n't really enjoy it* But my friend said it was really good!</li><li>Ordered: Gae-Jang ( marinated raw crab) 2/5* Plate of marinated crab for $ 12.99*

to pour over the rice.</li><li>Do not order Thai Fried Rice ( sea food) if you do n't like your food too salty and has a strong soy sauce and fish sauce taste.</li><li>It was served with what tasted like a teriyaki-based soy sauce that was sweet and spicy, which was so good I scooped the leftovers from my plate when no one was looking: P The golden curry at a 6 spice was boarderline too spicy for
