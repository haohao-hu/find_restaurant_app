<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 829' %><h2>lunch options<br />occurrence: 5</h2><div><ol><li>Overall, just a crappy experience. been here only few times and always for lunch. lunch options are very good and at least vegetarian options are pretty cheap ( tofu bento box + soup + salad = $ 7). the food is yummy! and they have some interesting appetizers like avocado tempura! which is just delicious! the staff is friendly and helpful.</li><li>They also have great lunch options that I have gotten for take out before.</li><li>Nice and modern, this place serves some good lunch options like stuffed cr√®ps and wonderful waffles as well as a good selection of some tasty beverages.</li><li>The lunch options are neither extremely expensive nor very inexpensive, and there 's a wide variety of options for pricing.</li><li>We 'd pass other lunch options, sure, but none could touch the following equation: Turkey, bacon, extra mayo.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
