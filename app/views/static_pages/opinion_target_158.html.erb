<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 158' %><h2>soy sauce<br />occurrence: 41</h2><div><ol><li>My friend and I ordered- steamed xo sauce pork neck rice: a little bland, and came with a bowl of cooked lettuce in soy sauce ...- stinky hot pot: really good, with intestines, pigs blood, enokie mushrooms, fish balls, and fish cake- mixed vegetables and tofu dry pot: it was okay- herbal essence jelly in coconut milk: awesome- mango freeze: she said it was awesome The decor is nice, the service is unfriendly.</li><li>Also got tempura sauce taste like soy sauce.</li><li>They also have gluten free soy sauce available.</li><li>I asked for extra soy sauce and they gave us 4 packets.</li><li>It 's made with raw crabs ( usually smaller and soft-shelled) and marinated with either soy sauce or spicy sauce.</li><li>Ordered: Gae-Jang ( marinated raw crab) 2/5* Plate of marinated crab for $ 12.99* You can order soy sauce based or spicy sauce based* I ordered soy sauce based Gae Jang* Basically you get 2 small crabs all cracked up* Soy sauce marinade was decent but a little too sweet* What turned me off from this is how the crabs did n't taste very fresh* Although it is marinated, because you are eating this raw- freshness is quite important* My mouth felt a little dry/tough after eating this and it was n't very pleasant* The claw part was n't cracked and there was no way I could break it with my teeth* I was quite disappointed with this dish since I was looking forward to it Ordered: CheolPan JjooGgooMi ( baby squid stir fry) 5/5* Baby squid stir fried with vegetables and ricecake for two people at $ 19.99* This was recommended by my friend who 's had it before* It 's meant for 2 people and cooked at your table* This is very spicy ( be aware !!)* It came with lots of baby squid, ricecakes and vegetables* Sauce was very intense in flavor ( spices) and it was good to eat with rice* I thought it was kind of odd how they had broccoli in it* I loved this dish and would go back just for it Complimentary: Kong Bi Ji* This is a grinded up bean paste that people like to eat with the rice* I am not a big fan of beans .... or grinded up beans so I did n't really enjoy it* But my friend said it was really good!</li><li>Ordered: Gae-Jang ( marinated raw crab) 2/5* Plate of marinated crab for $ 12.99* You can order soy sauce based or spicy sauce based* I ordered soy sauce based

special, unique soy sauce)- $ 14.99 I found the brine for the GanJang to be more flavorful while not overpowering nor too salty.</li><li>Gen was a big fan of the special soy sauce blend and taught us to eat it by taking some of the rice and putting it into the shell of the crab in order to use up the soy sauce blend.</li><li>The soy sauce was actually really delicious!</li><li>The only reason I did n't rate them a full 5 stars is because they use regular soy sauce to season the sushi on the Tokyo platter and the sodium level was much too high for my liking.</li><li>There was no other seasoning besides the soy sauce they provided.</li><li>The rice lacked flavour and I had to rely heavily on the soy sauce.</li><li>Lechon Kawali ( crispy fried pork), pancit canton ( thick egg noodles w/ veggies in a tasty sauce), beefsteak ( thinly sliced beef w/ onions in a rich sauce) and the best Garlic rice I 've ever had ( think Chinese fried rice w/o all the soy sauce just lots of garlic).</li><li>There were two pieces of agedashi tofu ( deep fried tofu with a sweet/fishy/savory soy sauce).</li><li>The Shrimp with lobster sauce was very dark ( looked liked they seasoned it with soy sauce), not authentic but tasty with lots of sauce to pour over the rice.</li><li>This was a soy sauce based version that I found lacked depth since I could only taste salt as the main spice with a hint of Jerk seasoning.</li><li>Do not order Thai Fried Rice ( sea food) if you do n't like your food too salty and has a strong soy sauce and fish sauce taste.</li><li>It was served with what tasted like a teriyaki-based soy sauce that was sweet and spicy, which was so good I scooped the leftovers from my plate when no one was looking: P The golden curry at a 6 spice was boarderline too spicy for me ( and I 'm a hot sauce on anything you can imagine kind of girl), but was complimented well by the cooling coconut milk that comes as an aftertaste to the initial chili and spice taste.</li><li>I had to get our soy sauce and wasabi.</li><li>Their rice is just plain white rice, which they ask if you want soy sauce on and their garlic bread is just really mediocre.</li><li>Sausage &amp; minced pork rice with egg: rice was way over cooked, mince pork tasted nothing but soy sauce, egg was burnt on one side, vegetable look and tasted like left over from 2 days ago coming straight out of fridge.</li><li>They 'll get the job done, but do n't expect a pleasant smile when you ask for extra soy sauce.</li><li>The sliced beef is braised marble beef slices tossed in a special house soy sauce topped with sesame seeds and cilantro.</li><li>You can taste the soy sauce used in their cooking is more of the phoney Maggi/China Lily variety.</li><li>He says it just tastes like sweet soy sauce and it makes the chicken soggy.</li><li>However, they seriously need to change their soy sauce ( b/c it 's way too salty) and ruined my sushi.</li><li>Came with a very small salad and soy sauce.</li><li>It was a rip off, I was soooo hungry, that I had to put soy sauce all over my rice and fill up on that.</li><li>Ca n't go wrong with a spritz of soy sauce and crumbles of wasabi.</li><li>I have several allergies and brought my own `` soy sauce.''</li><li>My boyfriend and I asked for a side of rice and soy sauce and a Budweiser.</li><li>My boyfriend ordered the beer and 2 side orders of rice with soy sauce, since I was n't hungry and he does n't have a big appetite.</li><li>BulGoGi Busot JjiGae 韓式牛肉蘑茹湯 Bulgogi and mushroom soup with sweet soy sauce* and this is what I ordered this is my favorite dish so I was really expecting it to taste the same it did n't lack some flavor but still good I would say they did n't put enough of the sweet potato noodles compared to the other location but I did finish it ..</li><li>The steam sea bass was alright, they soy sauce really goes well with the fish.</li><li>I expected a savory component that I did not find ( for example, a touch of soy sauce).</li><li>I ordered all the most horrifying things to a sashimi virgin, and mixed the wasabi and soy sauce for him.</li><li>Lunch is a bad experience with a dark interior, an Asian man in an ill-fitting suit who pours the soy sauce for you and says `` watch out for the wasabi'', and an Asian woman with a geisha outfit that does n't know the first thing about poise, etiquette and gracefulness.</li><li>Does it have a good flavor without having to add chili oil or soy sauce.</li><li>I ordered the Orochong Ramen ( Soy sauce flavoured spicy ramen with chicken and vegetable toppings).</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
