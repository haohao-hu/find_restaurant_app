<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 189' %><h2>girl<br />occurrence: 33</h2><div><ol><li>The girl who was the only waitress there was super nice and helpful and polite.</li><li>There was this one time where I was here with two of my girlfriends and I was telling them about this girl named Melinda whom I has a crush on during Chinese school, and then I sat up straight only to see Melinda looking at me with her huge eyeballs in the booth next to mine.</li><li>This is one crazy Flea Market that basically has everything from antiques, persian rugs, perfume, clothes, car parts, electronics and knock off stuff Come hungry because the food court at the back offers the most diverse menu Caribbean, latin american, chinese, and a girl that makes awesome cupcakes.</li><li>Also, the bartender, particularly the girl in black, dealt with a huge influx of orders with stellar coolness and efficiency.</li><li>Almost ready to pay, the fat owner comes out from the back and sees the friendly girl who served my about to ring up this fantastic coffee ( did I mention I love it ?).</li><li>What I really love about this place is the environment so if you want to come here with friends or a girl this place will be your good choice as it is nice and organized.</li><li>The poor girl looked so distressed, I wanted to jump behind the counter and help her.</li><li>But she never used the spray bottle of cleanser on any of the services which include the dirty stacked up garbage area, She looks like the little rich girl who was forced to help out by her Chinese daddy so was working his butt off behind the counter.</li><li>The girl at the tile seems to hate her life and was acting super rude, throwing napkins at me.</li><li>The girl at the counter ca n't seem to even take a simple order, after repeating my requesting for pudding on top of my pearl bbtea, she even repeated it verifying pearls and pudding ?</li><li>It was served with what tasted like a teriyaki-based soy sauce that was sweet and spicy, which was so good I scooped the leftovers from my plate when no one was looking: P The golden curry at a 6 spice was boarderline too spicy for me ( and I 'm a hot sauce on anything you can imagine kind of girl), but was complimented well by the cooling coconut milk that comes as an aftertaste to the initial chili and spice taste.</li><li>The girl says it is and I tell her its not because I can see chunks of the green tea powder stuck at the bottom.</li><li>The take out lady took a phone order and a girl who was obviously new was left to man the station.</li><li>The girl that works there is super nice.</li><li>The girl at the counter was super excited and friendly.</li><li>Waiter and this tiny little short girl who is the manager say they cannot redeem me the full value of my groupon because my kids are not adults and thus we are not a group of 4 !!!!</li><li>Tiny little short girl manager says i can give you what you paid for your groupon and redeems 36.50 on my final bill after taxes.</li><li>I 've only encountered one nice girl ...</li><li>The girl who answered my call refused to take this order and asked me to call her back at 8pm to remind her otherwise it will be too confusing!</li><li>The girl working here was quite rude as if she did n't want to be there.</li><li>I double checked with both the guy who took my order and the girl who gave me my order and both repeatedly stated that there was lime in my bag of takeout containers.</li><li>The girl who worked there said, in a not-so-nice tone, that it will be 15min like I was inconveniencing her by ordering the lunch special.</li><li>Fourth star, and this is a big one ladies and gents, goes bye bye because the same rude girl DROPPED a cup on the floor, PICKED it up and then put it on the table she was serving after checking whether the guys eating noticed:) Amazing.</li><li>A coworker wanted to share ( I thank her silently in my head everytime i get to go, still to this day) and she said to me `` Girl, I could drink the whipped cream here'' and I said oh you can have mines.</li><li>Nice and clean, though the decor is confusing ( christmas garlands with nutcrackers and fake summer flowers ?) anyway, the service is great, the girl is always standing waiting to serve you, though she did n't understand my question when i asked what type of cakes they have.</li><li>I do n't know how many times I had to ask for my water refill and when it did happen, the girl was n't very nice, pouring it rudely while spilling a bit on the table.</li><li>The other two dishes did n't show up for another five ( the guy 's meal) and then ten ( the girl with the missing place mat 's meal) minutes.</li><li>Salmon sushi pizza Salmon sushi hand roll Salmon sushi $ 38.40 Rice tasted weird Sushi had a stale after taste Drowned my salmon sushi in soya sauce and it still did n't help get rid of the awful aftertaste They charge you extra for fish eggs ( The girl kept telling me it was 5 cents extra and they charged me $ 2.50 When I spoke to the manager he said it was 50 cents extra per order) The girl taking my order could n't spell or understand English The food was awful, I usually order from Vip sushi whose prices and food taste way better.</li><li>Salmon sushi pizza Salmon sushi hand roll Salmon sushi $ 38.40 Rice tasted weird Sushi had a stale after

was good to the timing!</li><li>The girl behind the counter finally came and said `` hello'' to us as we were leaving.</li><li>One girl in our party told the waitress that she could not eat anything with black pepper in her food due to an intolerance.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
