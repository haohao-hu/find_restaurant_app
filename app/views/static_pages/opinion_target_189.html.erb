<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 189' %><h2>sushi bar<br />occurrence: 27</h2><div><ol><li>I also noticed they had a blowtorch at the sushi bar.</li><li>I sat by the sushi bar, and I noticed that there is a huge plate of spicy salmon and tuna rolls just sitting there, god knows how many hours ago they were made.</li><li>What 's even worse is that plates of food sit for up to 20 minutes by the sushi bar before a waitress would come pick it up.</li><li>We had a delicious meal here- unfortunately the server was n't very quick to greet us and our food sat on top of the sushi bar waiting to come to us for a long long time.</li><li>Bar-like atmosphere with the sushi bar smack dab in the middle of the restaurant.</li><li>First impression of the place was great ~ the interior decoration looked nice and the sushi bar tied everything together.</li><li>It is n't often that one leaves a sushi bar comfortably full while not paying a huge amount for it.</li><li>Ambience is cool, they managed to successfully transform it from the previous run down pub to an upscale sushi bar.</li><li>I sat at the sushi bar, since I was alone, and it took forever ( at least 15 minutes) to even be greeted by a server, despite the fact that I was literally sitting right next to where they grabbed the sushi from to take to other tables.</li><li>The only thing I do n't like is their sushi bar is full, and I did n't get a chance to sit there ~.</li><li>The sushi bar is definitely one of the best I have been to anywhere.</li><li>The sushi bar is excellent for the following reasons: a) the seats are comfortable and have backs so you can hang your coat, b) they are high enough so that you 're not looking up at the sushi cooler and c) the activity behind the bar is theatrical.</li><li>I was told once that a sushi experience happens at the sushi bar.</li><li>Though I was seated at the sushi bar but far away from the 2 sushi chefs who were so busy the whole time I was there!</li><li>All of the staff seemed very enthused by our presence at the sushi bar and we were comped an amazingly delicious whole grilled saba ( mackerel- 5 stars).</li><li>If you appreciate the sushi bar experience and are in the area, please come in and give these folks a break from the constant stream of take out orders!</li><li>And I usually like to see through the sushi bar to watch how they make all kinds of sushi but the layout of this restaurant limits you doing that.</li><li>You barely can see the sushi bar.</li><li>I personally thought the way the salads were presented was beautiful. really fresh fish for its low price. this sushi resaurant is actually one of the oldest in north york area since 1999 ( ? im pretty sure) when u enter, sushi bar greets u with irashaimasen and ur immediately seated by a waitress or waiter. hot green tea is usually given as soon as you seat down and after you order, some free edamame and tofu comes out. then u get the food u ordered ( fast) and ur tea is never emptied bc of the constant refill and quality checks. the place is old but i looks neat.</li><li>A large sushi bar looks like it would fill up if people could pick this place out of the crowd.</li><li>Gone was the old sushi bar and all the Japanese decoration but the lay out of the restaurant is really similar.</li><li>This sushi bar has a lot of fusion sushi rolls, guess it is to accommodate the western population that are living in the area.</li><li>The place itself is actually pretty nice inside and there is a sushi bar ( like most places), where you can watch the guy make the sushi I ordered a krab roll with a Beef Don.</li><li>A dining area out front devoted to all things sushi, another dining area in back with six large teppanyaki grills for eating and a large sushi bar that runs along one side of the restaurant with a pond on the opposite wall.</li><li>This is an AYCE sushi bar which seems to be the only one near me and is worth the 2 block walk south down yonge street.</li><li>I have also tried the teppanyaki here, and although i find it baffling that anybody would choose teppanyaki table over sitting at the sushi bar, that is my own opinion.</li><li>There was even talk of the changed ownership demanding that the sushi bar be removed ( equivalent to going to a baseball game and having the concession foods removed).</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
