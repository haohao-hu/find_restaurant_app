<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 624' %><h2>corned beef<br />occurrence: 6</h2><div><ol><li>This is a small deli in a small strip mall on Sheppard, serving smoked meat, corned beef and pastrami sandwiches, as well as knishes and a few other things.</li><li>The spicy mustard that went with the rye bread and the beef made the dish all the more salivating and I took home a pound of the corned beef following my meal ...... three homemade sandwiches later with Wolfie 's meat, I 'd still go back for more I quite liked the friendly man who served us the two times we went.</li><li>If I 'm ever in Toronto again, this California girl is coming back to Katz. there pastrami/ corned beef is good, they stack em pretty high and just a lttle dry, cafeteria like, everything is ala carte, i usually get, a big pastrami sandwich on rye, fries and a piece of the rich chocolate cake, a vernors to wash it all down .... gets busy a lunch, plenty of seating, a bit expensive, last time i went $ 9 bucks a sandwich ( around there) ... But this place has been around since i was a kid ( dating myself) right across the street from yorkdale, easy access from the 401, right on dufferin .... try it once a bet youll go back ....</li><li>The lady at Katz 's described them this way: `` corned beef is mild, pastrami is spicy, smoked meat is sweet''.</li><li>The corned beef is certainly edible, but lacks the flavour and pop of the good stuff.</li><li>MENU RECOMMENDATIONS Seeing as it ` a `` Corned Beef Emporium'' I figured I 'd get the corned beef.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
