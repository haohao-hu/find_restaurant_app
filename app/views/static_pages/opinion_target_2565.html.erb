<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 2565' %><h2>custard<br />occurrence: 1</h2><div><ol><li>It was not great but awful.- clear skin chive and shrimp dimpling: okay. no complaint here.- black bean spare ribs: extremely salty but very tasty- deep fried squid tentacles: it did n't taste all the fresh because the whole thing was just not al dente enough. it should be less chewy and more rubbery. flavour was okay- garlic baby bok choy: a `` Special'' dish that was over $ 5 with fairly small portion. it was done VERY well though. best dish probably- custard bun: way too much flour and the custard was not dense at all.- singapore vermicelli: good, no complaints Overall, the food was decent, not the greatest dimsum but it satiates the craving, any time of the day.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
