<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 738' %><h2>nihari<br />occurrence: 6</h2><div><ol><li>The karahi and kebabs were decent but the nihari was one of the worst I have ever had.</li><li>The tawa keema and nihari with freshly made naan is awesome too.</li><li>The pieces of beef in the nihari were all chunks of fat and no meat.</li><li>The nihari was covered, immersed in oil, more oil, less curry, clumps of starch powder, and chunks of fat in lieu of meat.</li><li>You should orders things like: Halwa Puri ( Yummm), Nihari, Haleem, Chicken Seekh kabab, Butter Til Naan, Paaya, Lamb Biryani, Chicken Biryani, Lahori Chana masala, chicken tikka.</li><li>Would definitely recommend- Nihari, Paaya- the Nihari was quite good ( my mom said it was her favourite dish at the restaurant), but the Paaya was very tasteless and inedible I would definitely come here again, just stay away from the Paaya.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
