<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 756' %><h2>duck meat<br />occurrence: 5</h2><div><ol><li>The duck meat is prepared differently, more roasted and the meat literally flakes and falls off the bone, but so juicy!</li><li>We did get some very crispy skin pieces as well as pieces with both skin and the right amount of duck meat.</li><li>First course, slightly crispy duck skin ( though not nearly crispy enough to my liking), with fine slices of duck meat, to be wrapped in rice paper.</li><li>Second course, stir-fried duck meat.</li><li>In terms of taste, the duck was crispy and decent. it didnt have much flavour on its own, so you have to rely on the sauce provided to give it flavour. after you eat the skin, there are multiple options on how you want to eat the rest of the duck meat, you can serve it with garlic sauce or you can add more $ $ to eat it diced with lettuce or other options available.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
