<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 129' %><h2>thai food<br />occurrence: 46</h2><div><ol><li>I mean do n't expect authentic thai food, it 's more like thai fusion.</li><li>Their Thai food tastes like Chinese food.</li><li>I found better spring rolls in a tiny shop down the street I looooooove thai food ... not in spring rolls though ... it 's ok to come here for food on a lunch break maybe or while waiting for the movie at the cinema ... but not the ultimate food destination. what makes me put 2 starts is not even quality or authenticity of food but the smell of fried cheap oil that surrounds this restaurant whenever you pass it on the street ... there is also a hint of that smell inside in some parts of the restaurant ... other spring rolls locations would probably get a higher rating from me.</li><li>Our friends like thai food so we found ourselves at this cute little establishment a few weeks ago.</li><li>I never go out of my way for Thai food but this place was n't bad.</li><li>Probably the best Thai food you can get within 10 km radius.</li><li>Will definitely be back for more scrumptious Thai food!:) Zero stars if I could.</li><li>Normal Thai food restaurant in north york area.</li><li>One of the best thai places in Toronto for authentic thai food.</li><li>It 's our go to place for when we have a craving for Thai food.</li><li>One of the best Thai food I

was n't the greatest either. after eating dinner at Linda, s modern thai last night, I would not refer anyone who like, s good thai food to go there.the food is plan, and the portions are very small, well the price, s are high. dinner with two dish, s and a small salad was around seventy five dollar, s.we had to pick up food on the way home as we were still not full.there are so many better thai place, s in Toronto.</li><li>I love Thai food, but this place was just average for me.</li><li>If you want good thai food, go for Salad King or Khao San Road ( or Mengrai if looking for something
