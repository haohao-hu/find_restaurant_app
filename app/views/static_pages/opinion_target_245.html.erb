<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 245' %><h2>Persian food<br />occurrence: 23</h2><div><ol><li>Best Persian food in Ontario, Canada.</li><li>This is my first time having Persian food and I 'm SO glad someone brought me to her favourite Persian restaurant.</li><li>I have no experience with having Persian food so I have nothing to compare it to .. but it was one of the best new things I ever tried!</li><li>It 's also got curries and Persian food that you wo n't find at other Italian restaurants.</li><li>This is probably the BEST Persian food I 've had ... when I first encountered it about 5 years ago, the Koobideh was so amazing, very juicy and full of life!</li><li>Persian food available 24/7 WHAT ?!</li><li>From now on I will go there for Persian food and also will recommend this restaurant to all my friends.</li><li>Darband is for sure going to be a place that we 're going back to for some great and tasty Persian food.</li><li>I love Persian food, and found this place, it did not disappoint.</li><li>Ava Food Market has a little Persian food hot counter setup going in the back of their market.</li><li>I 've been on a bit of a Korean food kick for the last year and a half or so, but when I 'm not craving Korean food, I 'm craving Persian food.</li><li>Definitely check this place out if you want to try some authentic Persian food!</li><li>This place is great, if you like to buy good Persian food for cheap.</li><li>Definitely the best Persian food in the GTA.</li><li>The thing that surprised me is that not only does this restaurant have Persian food, it has a bit of the Arabic food touch and Italian dishes like pastas and pizzas.</li><li>They 've made this place more western rather than Persian ( I 'd almost classify it as a Persian/Italian place) which has pushed away a lot of their Iranian clientele however they are drawing in the foreign crowd which is a good thing in itself since everyone gets hooked on Persian food once they try it!</li><li>This is my first time having Persian food so I was n't too familiar with it.</li><li>I will most likely come back next time for more Persian food.</li><li>It was decent but I 'm spoiled with Banu as my benchmark for Persian food.</li><li>Not my go-to for Persian food.</li><li>Excellent best Persian food I tasted so far.</li><li>The only reason I 'll go back to this place is to try the ghormeh sabzi ( another basic persian food), so that I can add or remove another star from the review! 3.5/5- this place is usually friend and my go to place for Persian food.</li><li>Outdated tables and chairs, very dark and unpleasant atmosphere ... the food is by far the worst persian food Ive had .... no taste at all.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
