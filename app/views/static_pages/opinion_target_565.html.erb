<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 565' %><h2>spices<br />occurrence: 8</h2><div><ol><li>The grilled chicken is incredible because they char it up real nicely and the spices taste soaked into the meat and skin.</li><li>I think it 's the coconut milk that they use or the spices but basically I only like butter chicken.</li><li>While they prepare your fresh hot kabab you can go around and pick out some nuts, dates, breads, spices, cheeses, desserts, canned goods, teas, honey, a few fresh produce items, etc.</li><li>Their spices are very different.</li><li>This is not your run-of-the-mill Hakka place, this place serves Xinjiang style food, so do n't think Hakka or typical Chinese food, the spices here are very different.</li><li>The lamb was very soft and marinated in delicious spices which was n't overpowering at all.</li><li>At the back they have a selection of meats, veggies, aromatics, sauces, spices, noodles etc.</li><li>Would never go back to this place again for their unappetizing noodles that was overcooked, overly starchy broth, off balance of spices.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
