<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 292' %><h2>cabbage<br />occurrence: 19</h2><div><ol><li>No thick tomato sauce some places give you but a nice mild thin sauce that flavored the cabbage.</li><li>This goes very well with the cabbage and the fish fillet.</li><li>Ordered: Dak-Gal-Bee ( JS-1) 4/5* Chicken ( boneless dark meat) and assorted vegetables ( cabbage, sweet potato and greeon onion)* Choose your spiciness ( we went with B. The Joons Original Spicy Sauce)* $ 9.25 per portion ( 2 portions minimum), we ordered 3 portions for 3 people* Extra Add On: rice cake, mozzarella cheese, instant noodle, vegetables and fried rice* Extra add ons are all $ 2 except the fried rice* Everything is thrown together and comes to your table uncooked* Because it 's chicken, they take a while to fully cook and it drives you crazy* Servers will come around and cook them for you so do n't worry about the process* If you order mozarella cheese, they come midway and add it on near the end* For 3 portion order, I found there were n't much chicken* Original spicy sauce is not spicy at all !!</li><li>There was an addition dish of thinly shredded cabbage, lime onions and mint/ herbs to put in the soup.</li><li>I would admit that they gave a generous amount of pork, cabbage and noodles.</li><li>The cabbage was undercooked, so was the rice cakes.</li><li>There were barely any other ingredients- not much cabbage, green onions, etc.</li><li>The chicken and the cabbage though ?</li><li>I totes feel the pain of the other Yelpers, in that the cabbage and chicken did not taste fresh at all.</li><li>This option had chicken, mussels, cabbage, squid and shrimp mixed in.</li><li>I recommend getting the Seafood Dakgalbee, which comes with chicken ( boneless dark meat), assorted seafood ( baby octopus, shrimp, mussels), and cabbage.</li><li>The chicken chunks are tender pieces of dark meat, while the cabbage is softened by the sauce and heat.</li><li>What you need to know:- Do NOT order the dumplings- they tasted of freezer burn and were plated on stale cabbage.</li><li>Soontofu or Soondubu is probably my favourite Korean dish so far because it usually comes spicy, it has both meat ( should you choose), egg ( s), and veggies ( tofu, cabbage and stuff)!</li><li>They just ca n't get enough of this fermented cabbage.</li><li>This dish is a mixture of rice cakes, cabbage and small strips of pork.</li><li>For the sides; hummus, red cabbage, sliced tomatoes, onion herb mix and banana peppers with tahini sauce.</li><li>They also used cabbage which is not a common ingredient for this dish.</li><li>The salad was nice albeit a little difficult to eat because the cabbage was sliced so long and the Gyoza was really tasty.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
