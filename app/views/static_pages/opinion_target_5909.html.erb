<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 5909' %><h2>black sesame crepe for dessert<br />occurrence: 1</h2><div><ol><li>I mean it was good, just not excellent. it also came with a side salad that was dressed simply with oil and vinegar, a really nice touch. then we got the black sesame crepe for dessert, and let me just say, the ice cream is KILLER. you can taste the homemadeness of it. the whole thing was sprinkled with roasted peanuts and toasted oats ( kinda like granola) that added crunch. it was fairly big, pretty damn good, and the presentation was frickin sexy. i 'll definitely be back, but maybe next time I 'll only go the dessert route.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
