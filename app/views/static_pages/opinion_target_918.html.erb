<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 918' %><h2>mozarella cheese<br />occurrence: 4</h2><div><ol><li>Ordered: Dak-Gal-Bee ( JS-1) 4/5* Chicken ( boneless dark meat) and assorted vegetables ( cabbage, sweet potato and greeon onion)* Choose your spiciness ( we went with B. The Joons Original Spicy Sauce)* $ 9.25 per portion ( 2 portions minimum), we ordered 3 portions for 3 people* Extra Add On: rice cake, mozzarella cheese, instant noodle, vegetables and fried rice* Extra add ons are all $ 2 except the fried rice* Everything is thrown together and comes to your table uncooked* Because it 's chicken, they take a while to fully cook and it drives you crazy* Servers will come around and cook them for you so do n't worry about the process* If you order mozarella cheese, they come midway and add it on near the end* For 3 portion order, I found there were n't much chicken* Original spicy sauce is not spicy at all !!</li><li>If I say it 's not spicy ... it 's really not spicy* I did n't like the mozarella cheese, it had weird texture and it took away the spiciness of the dish* Instant noodles were good after it soaked up all the sauce* When you are 80% done, ask for your rice to be cooked and they will do it for you* I love the crispy bottom part of the rice Summary: I would go back to Joons, but would order things differently.</li><li>I would get the Suicidal spicy sauce ( although it sounds scary, Original spicy is not spicy at all) and would skip the mozarella cheese.</li><li>How can you make salade caprese with stale mozarella cheese and unripe tomatoes ?</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
