<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 141' %><h2>shrimp<br />occurrence: 49</h2><div><ol><li>The shrimp they use is slightly larger than what 's used at some other places.</li><li>The shrimp was really fresh!</li><li>If your looking for something fancy go somewhere else but if u want Chinese food and all u can eat then sure go here ... the shrimp is good but the lemon chicken is kinda funky.</li><li>It seems like they cut it in half to make it look bigger then deep fry with batter to hide the small shrimp.</li><li>The color was kind of off- all sashimi had a warm taste and it was covered in water- it just did n't taste pleasant, we ordered a second round of sashimi .. same thing Rolls- Our roll order was forgotten on the FIRST ticket .. mmm .. we ordered their signature roll .. it was really meh .... and the nori was chewy handroll- the Nori was very soft when it came ... portion of rice to filling .. rice more .. filling a bit .. no good Hot Food- beef roll enoki, and green onions, short ribs, grilled shrimp, grilled cutlet, grilled mushroom, grilled beef, grilled chicken heart, etc etc ( The shrimp did not taste fresh again) but overall the beef were all pretty good! ( or 2nd order some of the grill items were once again forgotten !!!! they were n't even full for the evening !!)</li><li>The tempura came out quick except for the shrimp, which took two additional orders until it finally came out.</li><li>This place knows how to deep fry properly as all the tempura came out crunchy, shrimp was the frozen kind ( mushy texture).</li><li>In terms of what we ordered: Mussels- excellent Chicken souvlaki- great Prime rib- no good, dont order this Garlic bread- excellent Steak and shrimp fajitas- steak not so good, shrimp was excellent Seems like they are n't too good with their beef, but everything else was great.</li><li>The Shrimp was so battered up and oily that I did n't even finish the one I took to try.</li><li>Slippage .. everything is way too greasy and they skimped on the shrimp in my noodle dish.</li><li>The right amount of sweet and salty to get our appetite going;) Then I ordered the Pescatore Alla Marinara which had Shrimp, calamari, clams, salmon &amp; mussels with linguine pasta, all tossed in marinara sauce.</li><li>The noodles, tempura ( veggies only, the shrimp was meh), beef and rock shrimp were the highlights.</li><li>I had a quail egg ( tasted canned), a wonton ( lots of shrimp and pork filling, I wished there was more than just 1), a shrimp ( a good size, but not completely de-veined), 2 pieces of squid ( tasted rubbery), a piece of BBQ pork ( good flavour and not too fatty), 2 pieces of thinly sliced liver ( I do n't usually like liver, but this was ok), 2 pieces of thinly sliced heart ( I gave this to my dad because other than liver I do n't eat organ meats), and a fried fish ball sliced in two ( tasted good).</li><li>She said the shrimp tasted soft and mushy and not fresh and the pancake was greasy.</li><li>Also, the shrimp were perfectly butterflied and cooked.</li><li>I thought the battered pieces of shrimp, though hearty in size, were just plain bland.</li><li>It featured good quality pasta, and an assortment of well-cooked seafood, including scallops, shrimp, crab, clams and mussels.</li><li>Besides the pork cutlet on rice, the shrimp and potato salad is also my mom 's favorite.</li><li>The additional charge was $ 5 and he got exactly 5 pieces of shrimp, so $ 1 per shrimp.</li><li>I thought we 're having Italian), my mom ordered it and it was n't bad + SHRIMP ARRABBIATTA, sister ordered it and it was n't bad either + VEAL PARMESAN, because I wanted something covered in tomato sauce and it was good too ... but I 've tasted better. + broski had the LASAGNA, and it was alright too. + daddyo had the GRILLED VEAL TENDERLOIN, yeah this one was actually really good.</li><li>I have been here many times before, and some of my favourite pastas are the following,- linguine clams pasta- shrimp Portabello pasta I wish their waiters would smile a little.</li><li>There was an abundance of seafood which includes squid, shrimp, clams, white fish ... etc.</li><li>It comes with clams, octopus, squid, and tiny shrimp.</li><li>Our son ordered the Fritta mista di mare, lightly breaded and fried mixture of large shrimp, calamari, and cuttlefish.</li><li>The calamari was tender, cuttlefish was light and tasty, shrimp were huge and scallops were cooked to perfection.</li><li>We had lobster bisque, papaya salad, giant shrimp, beef brisket in curry, soft shell crab, plus several more dishes.</li><li>We also ordered an assortment of appetizers, skewers, shrimp etc ... presentation was basic and for my main I had the homemade Panang Curry.</li><li>Seafood udon had next to no seafood ( we found half a shrimp ?).</li><li>There were a ton of chicken, scallops, shrimp, squid, green peppers, and more.</li><li>I recommend getting the Seafood Dakgalbee, which comes with chicken ( boneless dark meat), assorted seafood ( baby octopus, shrimp, mussels), and cabbage.</li><li>Not as good a selection as downtown Dim Sum places and our steam shrimp balls were undercooked- the shrimp inside was cold and still grey.</li><li>The salad was good and the shrimp were delicious.</li><li>Now I would never complain about that ratio ... but here 's the kicker ( s): The breaded strips of chicken had a very odd, smoky flavour which after a hesitant second bite, revealed itself to be a strip of bacon wrapped around the chicken ( um, Jewish neighbourhood and no mention of it on the menu), the two chicken wings had a distinctive metallic flavour, the pork ribs were terribly chewy and dry, the shrimp had a mealy, thick dough around them that was n't even fully cooked through and had a terrible, raw-fish smell and taste that lingered in my mouth for an hour afterward and the chicken balls were ok.</li><li>The shrimp was fresh and crispy!</li><li>Ordered the Combination Soon Tofu ( Beef, shrimp, mussels) with medium spicy.</li><li>Combination Soon Tofu + Dolsotbab ( Beef, Shrimp, Mussel, $ 7.08) had a great broth as the base and what else took it over and above Tofu Village was that the Beef was not sniff-able sized but were edible bites and more pieces than Tofu Village.</li><li>The soup had mussels, shrimp, tofu, and cabbage.</li><li>My go-to is the combination soontofu with beef, mussels and shrimp.</li><li>I had the hard tacos- shrimp, chicken and pulled beef.</li><li>They have whole wheat, I tried the vegetarian, as they were out of fish and the shrimp looked suspect.</li><li>A-OK Linguine Alla Pescatore ( $ 18)- fresh shrimp, scallops, &amp; mussels with linguine pasta, tossed in a light spicy tomato sauce Shrimp Penne Arrabiata ( $ 10)- fresh shrimps and penne tossed in a very spicy tomato sauce- I found the fault is in the sauce ... it just tasted canned ... and really Americanized/Canadianized ... just not really Italian Authentic- Portion wise for the Linguine Alla Pescatore is pretty small ... may I suggest Armando 's use a bigger plate and improve on the presentation Tiramisu ( $ 6)- MEH !!</li><li>I had the Suyatem Plate ( $ 28), which came w/ assorted nigiri sushi ( few pieces of raw sushi, 2 rolls), assorted tempera ( shrimp, zucchini, yam), chicken yakitori.</li><li>We were there to celebrate a birthday so my dad ordered various appetizers including beef sashimi ( tender and juicy, equivalent to eating beef tartare), a sushi boat ( featuring fresh spicy tuna maki, hamachi, toro, maguro, squid with salmon roe, and raw shrimp- good to order so that everyone at the table can sample different sushi and sashimi), the usual vegetables ( aka tempura), and blue tuna spicy and California hand rolls.</li><li>The shrimp were just OK.</li><li>Then there is the MONGOLIAN BBQ part- starting with proteins, you get a choice of chicken, lamb, beef, shrimp, calamari, tofu- there is lots to choose from for everybody.</li><li>The congee was good, lots of seafood variety with salmon, shrimp, crab etc. the cantonese chow mein was mediocre, it 's my brothers fave so we end up ordering that but I felt the noodles were too crispy for my liking.</li><li>The shrimp was disgusting!</li><li>Jumbo Prawn Masala- plump, juicy shrimp in a savoury gravy.</li><li>They have a variety of curry: chicken, beef, lamb, shrimp.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
