<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 3356' %><h2>tea + miso soup<br />occurrence: 1</h2><div><ol><li>I like the decor- feels authentic. not the music though. every time we get there it 's a collection of oldies ... still listenable ... but why not japanese classical music ? anyway. none of my friends every complained about the food. they only have one veg bento box on lunch special but it 's pretty good and very filling. tea + miso soup + orange at the end = included. they also introduced discount cards- collect 4 lunch stamps and get 5th one with 13% discount. collect 9 and get 10th with $ 10 discount. sounds as a good idea. the lunches end up costing around $ 12 with tax + tip.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
