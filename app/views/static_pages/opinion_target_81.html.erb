<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 81' %><h2>veggies<br />occurrence: 74</h2><div><ol><li>Whenever I call to them about my issues they never really seem to apologize, rather blame it on me; `` you did not tell me no sunflower seeds'' ( i did) `` do n't leave the salad in the car or the veggies get brown'' ( i never do) `` my chef forgot to put in the carrots, I will give you extra next time'' ( I watched her make my salad, not a chef &amp; my salad literally had lettuce, cheese and 4 mandarin oranges in it).</li><li>The veggies, all cold.</li><li>Bistec carne frita: Typical Chilean dish, served with flavorful rice, beef steak, veggies.</li><li>Lots of frozen fish and some frozen veggies available all at competitive prices.</li><li>They had salads, eggplant, veggies to the cooked meat from chicken in various styles from baked, breaded and stuffed to fish and pork.</li><li>The veggies were so peppered it had me coughing!</li><li>Being vegan, I have to exclude the beef and egg from my bibimbap, so the variety, freshness, and flavour of the veggies is what I look for.</li><li>The veggies are perfectly saut√©ed and very vibrant, which makes for a beautiful bibimbap.</li><li>The meat also felt very unfresh and the combination of veggies did n't even give the rice any flavour.</li><li>Moving on to the main dishes, the Shrimp sizzler tasted more Indian than Chinese, even with the spring onions and crisp veggies, a bit like how my grandma makes it ( her cooking is Burmese/Indian influenced).</li><li>The chicken itself has a pretty good flavor, but the wilted lettuce and sorry looking toppings always have me disappointed, and somehow there were fruit flies buzzing around all the veggies even though it 's- 4 degrees out ..</li><li>The portion is substantial, and they do n't cheap out on the veggies they add to the bun.</li><li>Not a fan of the noodles or the rice but the veggies and plantation bananas are all right I guess ( I 'm a carnivore to the core so if it is n't meat it 's a distraction anyway).</li><li>The veggies and mashed potatoes were good.</li><li>My side of ' seasonal veggies' was overcooked, and the bell peppers were too soft and with no crunch to it.</li><li>Food came out .. chicken dry .. but edible .. hubbys veggies were raw and my wild rice was hard as a rock.</li><li>Had the following Calamari- Not too greasy, could be a bit crispier but thoroughly enjoyed it with the Cajun dip Tortilla and Dip- Tasty and refills of tortillas was offered by our server Ribs with Fries n Beans- Ribs were prepared quite good, fall off the bone, not too fatty, not too much muscle fibers, sauce was good, fries were crispy, bans were not mush, definitely recommended NY and Top Sirloin Steak was cooked proper to medium rare, for the price it had a decent depth of flavor, salad that came with it was pretty standard, veggies were cooked well, mashed potatoes was good, first time having the Peppercorn sauce not taste like burnt chocolate, bravo to the new kitchen staff Probably will come back but I 'll probably request Miranda as my server as there 's been too many servers that take their job for granted at this location.*** note they do n't validate parking anymore 2apps 3 entrees Above average gratuity Around $ 150 for 3 happy and full people Will come back to this location if I 'm having a craving for tender ribs Really nicely designed.</li><li>I used to love the fresh veggies ( carrots, cauliflower &amp; broccoli), instead we got a few limp and oily pieces of pepper, and one piece of cauliflower.</li><li>We ordered the Kashk Bademjam ( puree of golden fried eggplant with onion whey and mint), Persian soup ( veggies, noodles, pinto beans, whey, sauteed garlic and mint), and Koobideh ( charbroiled, seasoned ground beef) Kebab with rice.</li><li>The freshest thing was the veggies.</li><li>What I loved:- extra cheese included many choices such as goat cheese, cheddar and Monterey Jack- extra bacon included 2-3 slices- guacamole was free- lots of great fixings to order from, veggies were also fresh ...- so much free sauce and spices ...</li><li>I wish we had ordered veggies to balance the meal.</li><li>The rice was not warm, and the veggies were hard, not cooked but flashed to heat.</li><li>Veggies tasted fresh.</li><li>My burger had all of the major food groups: spice, cheese, veggies, bacon, and beef.</li><li>All the veggies were raw and the chicken was half-cooked so it took awhile for everything in the hotpot to to be fully cooked, but it was worth the wait!</li><li>5) jap chae ( stir fried noodle with vegetables)- lots of veggies and meat, always comes out super hot and fresh, and never gets too ' sticky' or ' clumpy'. one of the best places for jap chae.</li><li>My breaded veal with peppercorn was not working for me at all but the veggies were n't bad.</li><li>It was perfectly balanced with the veggies and meat/shrimps.</li><li>The chicken was well seasoned and the veggies were fresh and crunchy.</li><li>I got the cheese, rice cake, fish cake, veggies and extra ramen for this ramen dish and it was shared among two people.</li><li>YUM! bad part is that the veggies is no really good or much variety. and you can only order one order of instant noodles, even if you want more and want to add money ? no way.</li><li>After the dumplings were served, they brought out plates of veggies ( green beans and spinach), then the rice and noodle dishes.</li><li>Ordered: Porkbelly BBQ ( Sam Kyup Sal)* Pork belly BBQ served with mushrooms, onions and veggies for wrapping* You cook this on a BBQ grill at your table* Served with green onions and you can add it to your ' ssam' Green onions with chili powder and some vinegar for you to eat with the grilled meat Ordered: Marinated Beef ( Ju Mul Luk)* Beef mixed with veggies in a sweet sauce* I much prefer this over Bulgogi which I find it to be too sweet* This you also cook at your table with the grill Ordered: Kimchi Stew ( KimChi JjiGae)* It was interesting to see vermicelli in a Kimchi stew* The soup was just spicy enough and not too sour* Usually you eat this with a bowl of rice Ordered: Dumplings ( Mandoo)* These were Mul-Mandoo which means it is cooked in boiling water* You dip this into soy sauce Ordered: Spicy Soup ( Jjam Ppong Tang)* This is usually a noodle dish but this specific one was made without for drinking* It makes a nice dish to order when you are drinking soju* Filled with seafood and veggies Ordered: Seafood Pancake ( Hae Mul Pa Jeon)* There was n't much seafood in the pancake* I did n't really enjoy this Ordered: Spicy octopus &amp; pork* This is a table top cooking with veggies, octopus and pork* You can adjust the spiciness of this dish* Usually comes in 2 portions but we added an extra serving* Because there was so much food it did take a while to cook Conclusion: Now that I 've been back 3 times and tried couple things off their menu, I am convinced that even from their never-ending menu- they serve good Korean food.</li><li>It comes wraped in warm toasted pita with all the veggies and served with a delicious tahini sauce.</li><li>Here are my favourites at this place:- Shrimp Tempura ( HUGE Shrimps with a nice crispy finish)- Red Dragon ( This roll is wrapped up in delicious smoked salmon)- Green Dragon ( a delicious combo of shrimp, crab and veggies wrapped up in fresh green avocado)- Golden California Rolls ( Not as healthy but it is fried to perfection and melts in your mouth)- Chicken Teriyaki bento box ( tons of food!</li><li>Chicken, veggies, rice, 6 pieces of sushi, and dessert) Overall, Ginza is cheap, yummy and close to anyone who lives far north in Toronto.</li><li>The toppings were very fresh and tasty, you could actually taste the different flavors in the veggies!</li><li>It was a nice dish when some of the spicy sauce was mixed in; the pot crisped the rice nicely, and the veggies were fresh.</li><li>Soontofu or Soondubu is probably my favourite Korean dish so far because it usually comes spicy, it has both meat ( should you choose), egg ( s), and veggies ( tofu, cabbage and stuff)!</li><li>The tofu is silky and is complimented by different meats, seafood and veggies.</li><li>But I always manage to convince whoever is with me to partake in the Bimbimbob which is full of yummy veggies.</li><li>The bibimbap is great too .. all with fresh veggies.</li><li>Teppanyaki Ume ( see picture) is a very good full lunch which includes soup, salad, shrimp appetizer, rice, veggies, chicken and steak.</li><li>It 's assembly-line style ordering: type of tortitlla, type of meat ( I 've had pulled pork), toppings like veggies, cheese, guac ( EXTRA $ $), sour cream, and type of salsa ( warning: the hot IS hot).</li><li>The standard burrito build is rice, your choice of re-fried or black beans, grilled veggies ( mixed peppers and onions mostly), mild or medium sauce, both tomato and corn salsas, cheese, lettuce and sour cream.</li><li>A lot of tender meat, enough veggies and a potato ( `` gamja'') was there.</li><li>Both dinners came with generous portions of veggies and salads that have an `` in house'' dressing that is so good they should sell it for take home!</li><li>We had booked the typical ten course meal of assorted BBQ meats, fried chicken, Peking duck, lettuce wrap with minced duck, seafood egg drop soup, lobster, fried fish, veggies, fried rice, fried noodles, and dessert.</li><li>The veggies and hummus they add are beyond delicious.</li><li>Here is a blow by blow Salad: Veggies were fresh but drowned in an odd oily dressing.</li><li>The veggies were okay- it was a mix of zucchini, onion and mushrooms.</li><li>The veggies are cooked to perfection and fresh, and the salmon is well seared and the sauce was tasty as well.</li><li>For the main, I had the special of the day which was a 6oz New York steak with crab cake and seasonal veggies.</li><li>It had the clear noodles, veggies, octopus and chicken.</li><li>Most of the meats and veggies were sliced, rather than in chunks.</li><li>I 'm almost certain that Genghis Khan did not conquer much of Central Asia and China by feeding his subjects a dizzying choose-your-own-adventure of meats, veggies, sauces and condiment sauces to be grilled on a giant stone lifesaver.</li><li>You pile it high in a bowl, from a choice of meats to a great variety of veggies, add sauce and/or seasonings and hand it over.</li><li>Do n't know the name but their main thing is a build your own dish ( pick from a large assortment of veggies, meats and sauces give to chef who cooks it for you on this 6-8 for wide circular flat top stove) which is incredible ... and the food too.</li><li>You can choose your veggies, your meat and your sauce and voila you have what I call stir steamed veggies within under 2 minutes.</li><li>You pile meat and veggies in a bowl, ladle them with sauce ingredients, and awaaaaayyy you go.</li><li>Plenty of signage explained each step of the process from meat, to why you should add veggies, the noodle station to the sauces.</li><li>At the back they have a selection of meats, veggies, aromatics, sauces, spices, noodles etc.</li><li>You take a bowl and load it up with protein, veggies, rice or noodles, and a ladle of sauce, and then you give it to the chef who stir-fries it on a huge flat teppan-table thing.</li><li>Pick your meats, veggies, noodles and sauces and watch while it all gets cooked on a huge flat grill while you wait ( about 30 seconds).</li><li>You select meat, veggies, sauces and they cook it in front of you.</li><li>The veggies are fresh and clean.</li><li>Walk two steps and add veggies.</li><li>There is 2 main buffet tables with stuff like rice, veggies, meats- your regular chinese buffet items.</li><li>Fried noodles with wonderful veggies, seafood, and sauce.</li><li>For example, one particular night, there was a live worm in my food- probably crawled out of the veggies in the kitchen on to my plate.</li><li>Again, limited spice in the curry but the rice noodle and bean sprouts and veggies all mixed up worked very well together.</li><li>Throughout the work week the veggies are all very fresh.</li><li>On the weekends, there were a few times that the cucumbers looked a little frosty/frozen but this has n't been the case in the last few months -- maybe there is higher cucumber turnover or the restaurant has made more of an effort to restock fresh veggies.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
