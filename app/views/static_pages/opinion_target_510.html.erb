<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 510' %><h2>cucumbers<br />occurrence: 9</h2><div><ol><li>The food:- Banchan: the are very generous with the appetizers here, the little spicy cucumbers and japchae are my favorite 4/5- Beef bone soup: dumplings/ rice cake/ egg white drop in a milky beef bone broth soup 4/5- Dolsot bibimbap: so many toppings!</li><li>I really liked the side dishes as well- black sesame dressing salad, spicy cucumbers, eggplant. so I came here about 3 times already.</li><li>Not to mention the cucumbers are mushy and gone bad.</li><li>The worst offense was watching the cashier cut cucumbers and then handle the cash screen, money, people 's cards, and then go back to cutting cucumbers WITHOUT WASHING HER HANDS!</li><li>Salad Shirazi ( cucumbers, tomato, onions, dry mint, S/P with lemon/olive oil dressing) please do n't ruin the salad by using lemon juice from a bottle!</li><li>Wide assortment of toppings such as lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, pickles, cucumbers, black olives, jalapenos, hot peppers and tons of sauces to choose from.</li><li>I made an effort to try everything, though some I could n't resist sampling a few times, such as:- eggplant and tomato puree with loads of garlic- blinis with caviar- pickled cabbage, cucumbers and watermelon ( the latter being my new favourite!)- chicken kebabs- shredded chicken salad- spiced mushrooms- stuffed turkey neck- bread pastry ( almost phillo) with stuffed cheese Since the food was already laid out when we arrived, we began eating at 8pm, washing it all down with vodka and wine.</li><li>Herring, shrimp, jumbo shrimp, cocktail sauce ( so much cocktail sauce it was gross), smoked salmon, capers, cucumbers, etc ...</li><li>On the weekends, there were a few times that the cucumbers looked a little frosty/frozen but this has n't been the case in the last few months -- maybe there is higher cucumber turnover or the restaurant has made more of an effort to restock fresh veggies.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
