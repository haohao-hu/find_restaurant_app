compared to a morning minute steak or the steak on a HK sizzling plate.</li><li>I got a steak, mashed potatoes and veggies.</li><li>I would n't mind coming back if I feel like Boston Pizza again. we were just here couple of minutes ago, ordered artichoke dip, wings and steak. everything is edible and taste good except for the steak, i told the server that the steak is chewy and she said it suppose to be ok especially its medium rare, and she said that she cant do anything about it .. the steak os chewy, to the point that its not edible! the server is very nice but in situation like that she does n't know how to handle it!</li><li>I would n't mind coming back if I feel like Boston Pizza again. we were just here couple of minutes ago, ordered artichoke dip, wings and steak. everything

situation like that she does n't know how to handle it!</li><li>In terms of what we ordered: Mussels- excellent Chicken souvlaki- great Prime rib- no good, dont order this Garlic bread- excellent Steak and shrimp fajitas- steak not so good, shrimp was excellent Seems like they are n't too good with their beef, but everything else was great.</li><li>The steak was yummy, as was everything else.</li><li>Ordered a philly cheese steak and my picture shows little steak.</li><li>Nice basic Greek and Italian dishes, with a few American options ( hoagies are very good, even if it 's cheap white bread, cheap steak, and cheap cheese ... works nicely).</li><li>The second plate was cooked medium rare, but the quality of the steak is not the best- It was a bit hard to chew through the tendons, which I 've never seen in filet mignons ..</li><li>Our apologetic server gave us two complimentary desserts to make up for the overcooked steak.</li><li>The steak however is missing flavour ...</li><li>Everything from pumpkin ravioli, to steak, to braised beef short ribs.</li><li>Was expecting smaller thiner fries and the steak was too salty.</li><li>Great steak, but not enough things other than lettuce in salad.</li><li>The steak was very tender and juicy with the right amount of seasoning.</li><li>Overall great casual steak experience.</li><li>Great steak!</li><li>The dessert and holiday menu were a little meh but the awesome steak made up for that.</li><li>But I would learn later that it would 've been the same had I used a spoon to cut the steak.</li><li>Though the steak did come out perfect at medium rare, they need to improve on the quality of the steak itself.</li><li>I 've been going to this location for the past 5 years or so ~ the rib steak has always been my favorite here, but I ca n't help to notice it 's getting smaller every year ... it 's just not as good as before, disappointed and after my last try few weeks ago I 'll prob never visit again.</li><li>Fries was delicious and so was the steak cooked medium rare.</li><li>It came out super tiny, over cooked, and 12 $ more than the lunch special steak.</li><li>Suggest going during the week if you want a quiet dinner with your loved one, easier to find parking too. $ $ for low quality food. really disappointed, never going back. i had steak, lobster poutine, and caesar cocktail.</li><li>Over cooked steak.</li><li>The steak needs more flavor.</li><li>And the steak- as per my father, who almost always orders steak when he dines out- is the best steak he 's tasted in any Western restaurant we 've taken him to dine at thus far.</li><li>Even just looking at it when it was brought to the table promised a nicely-charred, perfectly-marbled steak.</li><li>The steak we order is always cooked to perfection with just a simple side but it is delicious.</li><li>This is a steak house so when you go here gotta get the 6oz filet with garlic mash and veg.</li><li>I orderd mini steak, 2 eggs, toast, 1 hash brown, and a coffee.</li><li>I originally thought about having steak, but at $ 32, it seemed a bit too pricey.</li><li>Deviating from traditional thai dishes, my girlfriend and I opted for the spring lamb and the steak.</li><li>Heard great things about this place came by for Sunday brunch but was disappointed we ordered the eggs benedict the steak and eggs and a kids meal my eggs were blanched not post and vastly undercooked unfortunately the steak was a little salty and not perfectly consistent with the other orders we saw coming out by the end of everything with one extra orange juice the bill was close to $ 50 we waited for service and the wait staff seems he prioritizing Cutlery over bringing us additional copies and our bill not thrilled.</li><li>Heard great things about this place came by for Sunday brunch but was disappointed we ordered the eggs benedict the steak and eggs and a kids meal my eggs were blanched not post and

12.99) and despite how good the Big Big looked, I think I made the right choice.</li><li>The steak is a whole ny striploin though so none of that fancy cut steak strips.</li><li>Their steak was dry and not even done to what i requested as it came well done when i asked for medium rare.</li><li>But the $ 35 steak was way too dry.</li><li>The server asked if I wanted a menu to get something else because he figured the 3rd attempt would n't be any better, but it had been over an hour since I asked for the steak and eggs and I was very hungry at this point.</li><li>Soup was ok but the story here is the steak.</li><li>It was the worst steak I 'd ever had in my life.</li><li>The steak was completely cold all the way through.</li><li>Also had their steak and eggs breakfast again- latkes were n't up to snuff today, but they were crispy.</li><li>The categories of food are as follows: Insalata, gourmet salads `` Na Pizza with plain to gourmet toppings Pasta with gourmet and basic sauces Piadina ( Italian flat bread) with several varieties like grilled chicken, seared tuna, Calabrese sausages, prosciutto, portobello mushroom and goat Panini ( sandwiches) from braised veal, steak, chcken to meat balls Sides are salads, seared broccolini ( rapini), marinated olives, and tuscan fries seasoned with sea salt, truffle oil and shaved Grana Padano Cheese Ok Stop Salivating and Go eat here!</li><li>My friend ordered `` Steak All Italian'' and I ordered the `` Pollo Balsamico'' we shared a side `` Tuscan Fries'' and 1/2 liter of their finest vino We both enjoyed our meal very much, they were extremely tasty and we found the sandwich to be a huge size.</li><li>Cames with green salad, potato salad, palm hearts, one egg sunny side up, steak, bacon, provolone cheese, ham, olives, red pepper, tomatoes, mushroom, mayo.</li><li>It was a special that requires a group of 8, everyone got a few maki/sushi rolls, a bowl of salad, miso soup, fried rice, a shrimp, a scallop, chicken, mixed veggies, salmon and steak.</li><li>Having said that, steak, chicken and shrimps were adequately prepared but I wo n't be running back.</li><li>- Good sushi, overall the teppanyaki was pretty good, esp. the steak.</li><li>Portion on the fries could have been bigger and I would have preferred the steak to have 2 pieces of bread and not open faced, but still really liked it.</li><li>The steak doesnt have much flavour itself but I always get the spicy sandwich with mushrooms and jalapenos and it over masks it.</li><li>Whether it 's a hot veal, steak, or chicken cutlet sandwich this place has the right stuff.</li><li>I know what good steak tastes like and what I had was not quite what I had in mind.</li><li>This was a good steak.</li><li>It had a great charred flavour to it and you could taste the natural juices of the beef sealed within the steak.</li><li>Misses- tuna sushi was not fresh, tempura was tasteless and not crisp, Agedashi tofu no flavour, beef teriyaki tough to chew and low grade cut ( round steak), portion sizes for the cooked dishes are small and about half the size of what 's typical.</li><li>Tiger shrimp was salty and steak was just ok.</li><li>The food was okay; the steak was very tender but a bit bland.</li><li>My steak was made to perfection and it was scrumptious.</li><li>Everyone who had steak was very satisfied with their meal.</li><li>If you want a great steak, you should definitely try it out !!</li><li>I ordered the steak and ribs combo with the steak blue ... you can tell a lot about the quality of a place by eating their steak almost-raw ... the steak was 5 stars worthy and the ribs were 3 ...</li><li>I ate a little bit and left the steak.</li><li>When the bill came I told the server that the steak was almost inedible- because it was very chewy.</li><li>Never get the steak here.</li><li>This isnt your fancy steak resturant so the price isnt too high compared to other steak resturant and the service is superb.</li><li>Prices are a lot higher than you 're average steakhouse but you can definitely expect professionalism from the staff and your steak to be cooked to perfection.</li><li>Whenever I end up eating a bad steak somewhere I can rest assure that if I come to Duncan, the steak will fix my appetite.</li><li>The steak was delicious, and they give you the right amount of potatoes ( mashed or ovened) with a side of vegetables.</li><li>Same goes for their steak, which wasnt dry at all and once you cut into it, the colour was beautiful.</li><li>When an order of steak is over $ 40, I expect the food to at least be done right.</li><li>The waitress came by and asked how we were doing and since she asked, I frankly told her the steak was n't done right.</li><li>When she confronted the waiter about the undercooked steak, he asked `` Do you want it cooked some more ?''.</li><li>This was n't the best steak I 've ever had.</li><li>Excellent rib steak ...</li><li>My steak order was n't too shabby but other members certainly did not enjoy their order ( I believe it was the corn steak or something), saying it was too saucy or too much spice.</li><li>The steak is perfectly aged and always cooked exactly to my liking.</li><li>When I brought it to the attention of the staff, I was told that I was wrong and that the steak was indeed medium rare.</li><li>Their steak is not bad and the portion is very generous.</li><li>The absolutely fantastic 16oz rib steak was the only dish that showed the kitchen 's potential, and was much better then the sirloin Steak, over cooked lobster, or disappointing duck.</li><li>The steak was pretty big!</li><li>Sometimes it 's the best steak, and sometimes it 's average.</li><li>This is a heavenly steak.</li><li>The steak was pretty burnt out the outside and the inside was fine.</li><li>The reason I gave my rating two stars is because the steak was piss poor.</li><li>The venue has a classy vintage feel with ample parking. the setting is very nice, calamari was chewy, steak was overcooked, service was slow and unprofessional, dessert was great. would not return.</li><li>My boyfriend liked his steak and eggs, but I think we can both agree that my dish was better!</li><li>Waitress asked how he wanted his steak, he said medium, when it came it was definitely well done.</li><li>100x better than Subway and their steak and chees is the bomb!</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
