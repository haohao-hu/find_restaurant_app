<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1083' %><h2>owner lady<br />occurrence: 4</h2><div><ol><li>Do n't even know if we could go on our road trip today just because of this meal. visited on tuesday night around 7pm for dinner. the place was packed and noisy. there were only 2 servers + owner lady ? so the service was very slow ( especially they have to cook the food for u at the table). they were so busy and my order was confused but she apologized politely right away so we just ate our meal w/out complain. but i still prefer the downtown location. their food &amp; service is better. and its really hot in the inner part of the restaurant.</li><li>Hearty comfort food for me! n the mash potato side dish is so yummy too! towards the end when u only have a bit of chicken n pieces of veggies left in ur pan, you can ask them to make fried rice with it. they will bring over rice, hot sauce/sesame oil mixture n mix it all up for u. the owner lady even formed the rice into a heart shape for me n my boyfriend one time. it was too cute ~! the Dak Gal Bee is so good there, every time we go that 's all we get. so i do n't know how the other items on the menu taste. oh and the minimum order for Dak Gal Bee is 2 people portions. service is fine, waitresses are pleasant, but sometimes do n't speak much English, but who cares, food 's good!</li><li>The owner lady did n't even apologize!</li><li>The owner lady was not even apologetic about our service, and made a stink that we did n't leave them tips.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
