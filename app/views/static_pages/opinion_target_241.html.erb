<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 241' %><h2>MSG<br />occurrence: 18</h2><div><ol><li>Their `` not so brothy'' beef broth for Kal Gook Soo is due to the fact that they do not use MSG ( unlike Buk-Chang-Dong Soon Tu Fu where all you can taste is MSG in their broth, yet people RAVE about their broth) and does not overload it with salt.</li><li>Always good with special requests ( e.g. no MSG, little oil, no sugar, etc)- combo entrees come with a variety of drinks, their milk tea is my go-to- staff/owners are usually friendly ( the guy wo n't let you leave once you get him started).</li><li>No MSG, large portions and it arrives fresh from the Wok.</li><li>The small size was soooo big I almost could n't finish it, but then I am a twenty-something Asian, might have something to do with it: P I did n't want the rare beef so they gave me more brisket, the broth did have a hint of MSG, but show me a pho place that does n't nowadays!</li><li>: D Mmmmm, the salty taste of MSG.</li><li>The soup is always to full of flavour, a little less MSG would be better but then it would n't be pho joint.</li><li>The Scarborough location of pho dau bo is a joke, the soup does n't taste half as good and is full of MSG.</li><li>I think this is the original location of the franchise because it 's run by Vietnamese ppl, always busy and the soup has little to NO MSG.</li><li>Once my MSG meter went up the cook confirmed my fears that they indeed do use MSG.</li><li>And their dishes do n't use MSG ( not that I can tell at least).</li><li>I 'm not sure if it 's MSG, but something also does n't taste very good in their rolls.</li><li>The broth, I could taste the MSG, so I did n't drink.</li><li>While it was recovering it gave that numbing sensation I usually get with MSG.</li><li>Although I have a feeling they use a lot of MSG cuz I was super thirsty when I got home.</li><li>Chinese food is famous for using lots of MSG and often leaving you with a greasy after taste.</li><li>Overall, its a good place to go if you are under a budget! so sad! this place is close! i used to come here but recently i realize that it 's been replace by a korean restaurant. the wontons are so filled with shrimp, the fish balls had bones in them i always get scared the bones might choke me but the food tasted awesome! hot water dispenser is at each table so you make your own tea. the soups tasted too much of msg ... delicious but ... msg is bad for you. bye bye wonton place, i kinda miss you. small portions, but i love how u can put your own oyster sauce into your noodles, instead of asking like other regular wonton noodle places. also enjoyed having a hot water faucet at my table. clean and good atmosphere.</li><li>Siu Mai was large but too salty and artificial msg.</li><li>I 've read reviews of people suggesting that they use msg.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
