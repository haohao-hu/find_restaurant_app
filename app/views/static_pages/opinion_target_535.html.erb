<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 535' %><h2>kalbi ribs<br />occurrence: 7</h2><div><ol><li>We tried a wide selection of appetizers including the fried tofu with something on top ( I forget what that is called ...), kalbi ribs, gyoza, yakitori.</li><li>The kalbi ribs were perfectly done- tasty but not dripping in sauce.</li><li>Other AYCE sushi restaurants will give you proper sushi and Miso Soup, for an even lower price ( 11.99 on most places for weekday lunch hours). bf and i came here last Sunday afternoon and had the gold menu for AYCE. it was less than average especially for the price, $ 21.99 on weekends and holidays and does not include drinks except for water and tea. this is the only AYCE place that comes out with our order of sashimi last. the most disappointing part was the food. salmon sushi were huge and sliced in cubes, steak cubes came in bits and pieces but was decent, buttered mushrooms were burnt, masago was too salty due to low quality, beef tataki was not fresh, i think the kalbi ribs were old cause they were so chewy i couldnt chew through them, spider roll was the worst! i couldnt even drink the tea cause the cups had such a strong bleach scent. needless to say, we will not be returning and would not recommend it to anyone.</li><li>The kalbi ribs were very chewy and the chicken had a funky after taste.</li><li>My LA Kalbi lunch ( roughly 8 individual kalbi ribs plus a large bowl of rice) I believe was ~ $ 12.</li><li>I was a little disappointed because I wanted the table BBQ and I thought that they had it, also the kalbi ribs were n't served with lettuce wraps.</li><li>We ordered the kalbi ribs and japchae. both were yummy.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
