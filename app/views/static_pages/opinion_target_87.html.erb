side of salad, roasted veggies, or fries.</li><li>I 've gotten the Chicken Soup ( lacked flavor) and the wings ( they were wings ... just not good ones) and a variety of their sandwiches.</li><li>Some of the sandwiches are decent but overall are not good enough to justify going there.</li><li>While the sandwiches are tasty and usually ready in reasonable time, I am not completely convinced about

etc.</li><li>Ordered 3 ( foot long) sandwiches at $ 6.50 each: Chicken adana, Kofte, Lamb shish.</li><li>This kosher, Cholov Yisrael dairy restaurant does pizza, dessert, veggie burgers, sandwiches, all day Israeli-style breakfast, falafel, ice-cream, soups and fish.</li><li>Their sandwiches are rarely misaligned which I find with a lot of other locations.</li><li>La prep offers breakfast, sandwiches, sides, pastries, coffees, teas and freshly squeezed drinks.</li><li>The sandwiches and burgers are very good too.</li><li>The pizzas beat any pizza place in the city, the parms ( eggplant, chicken or veal) are the best in the city and the sandwiches are hearty, filling and so good as well!</li><li>The menu itself is pretty decent, lots of choices standard fare like burgers, steak frites, sandwiches .... prices were really good too.</li><li>So we go to look at the menu and the girl at the cash is looking at us and making like psh sounds when we got our order they gave us 2 extra sandwiches free of charge.</li><li>My favourite deli; the sandwiches are perfect sized.</li><li>The perfect Jewish deli experience- delicious sandwiches, all the trappings you 'd expect.</li><li>Super friendly, hot filling sandwiches.</li><li>Worth 2 sandwiches.</li><li>Great sandwiches!</li><li>The spicy mustard that went with the rye bread and the beef made the dish all the more salivating and I took home a pound of the corned beef following my meal ...... three homemade sandwiches later with Wolfie 's meat, I 'd still go back for more I quite liked the friendly man who served us the two times we went.</li><li>These sandwiches are addictive, after having just one, I lust for another, but had to hold back and control my urge.</li><li>Tiny sandwiches.</li><li>I

options One of the first things I noticed when we got to Tutto Pronto was the ambiance.</li><li>I ordered a Margarita Pizza, which in my opinion was mediocre, but the people I ate with all got sandwiches or pastas that were all really good.</li><li>You can get smoothies with three fruits for $ 3.99, deli sandwiches with a bunch of veggie and meat options, or choose however much/whatever you

would n't have minded as much if he wore gloves while man-handling our meat and sandwiches ... but he did n't, and THAT is sick.</li><li>Came to just about $ 30 for 2 sandwiches and a small drink.</li><li>If course it was n't the best, but that does n't warrant a terrible experience because it was GOOD -- the sandwiches were bigger than my face!</li><li>Finally get two sandwiches and over-priced dull potato salad ( $ 5.80 for small you could feed a small village potato salad homemade at this price).</li><li>I have n't eaten at Katz 's in a while but for $ 21 for 2 sandwiches, I was n't impressed.</li><li>It 's my opinion that they could improve on their menu by allowing a choice of size ( it seems their sandwiches only come in one, large size).</li><li>Almost everything aside from the sandwiches are already pre made.</li><li>The sandwiches are meaty, they stack up the meat but the rye accompanying the sandwich is rather small and you get an overwhelming mouthful of meat with little to no bread.</li><li>This place was good, sandwiches are piled high with meat, sides are good, everything is fairly priced.</li><li>My husband and I were and found the food to be good and the sandwiches to be extremely generous in size.</li><li>The sandwiches are about $ 10.00 which is kind of expensive when you are in a cafeteria style restaurant However the meat was fresh hot, moist and flavourful so we felt it was worth it.</li><li>I do n't think they have their sandwiches in the box like they used to at least not as big a box and not as low a price.</li><li>Food is decent, nothing worth writing home about Both had different pasta dishes both 2/5 I am guessing the sandwiches and pizzas are probably better so I suggest opting for those of you happen to choose this place Set up and workers are nice but forgettable food make this one I would not suggest to anyone whatsoever Disclaimer: I live in Woodbridge and am probably a little tougher on Italian restaurants due to the wealth of great options in my area.</li><li>The pastas and sandwiches are definitely their specialty.</li><li>Coffees, Pastries, Breads, Sandwiches are always fresh and delicious.</li><li>They serve your basic sandwiches, a variety of salads, and a good selection of soups.</li><li>Menu selection is limited to soup, sandwiches, salads, and desserts ( possibly also breakfast), but everything I 've ever ordered here has been good.</li><li>I 've had sandwiches and they are great.</li><li>Service was predictably a little shaky when the doors first opened, but inside a couple of months things were running tight with a friendly wait staff, a cheap before 11:00am breakfast special ( $ 3.99 for toast, breakfast potatoes, a couple of eggs and bacon/sausage) and some truly delicious burgers and sandwiches.</li><li>The sandwiches were gigantic, and stuffed with cooked peppers and mushrooms, loaded with sauce.</li><li>To the front, you 've got the coffee stand, the bakery, sandwiches, juice bar, pizza bar, soup/rotisserie, next to the pastries/crepe/waffle/ice cream stations group in the front half of the restaurant.</li><li>You have the rosti, pasta, burgers, sandwiches, seafood, and desserts.</li><li>Where they really shine is the pasta dishes and sandwiches I find.</li><li>They make good sandwiches and have daily specials too.</li><li>But they still make great deal sandwiches, especially if you like it `` hot'' with their roasted jalapeno peppers and mozzarella cheese.</li><li>Both sandwiches were 4.99 each and with extra toppings and a drink came up to $ 14.</li><li>The sandwiches were enormous, stuffed with lots of meat, big pieces of onions and hot peppers ( they are super hot with the seeds in) It was an impossible sandwich to finish, so you can definitely get two meals out of one if your not a big eater.</li><li>You 're here for the sandwiches.</li><li>After I ate the sandwich I did n't need a nap, which I find with these types of sandwiches I always end up in a meat coma.</li><li>Also the sandwiches are always good ( try The Griller).</li><li>Service is quick and dismissive but the sandwiches are fresh as any.</li><li>The sandwiches still taste good but are expensive and the veal is hammered paper thin.</li><li>I would also like to say that the sandwiches are not 100% consistent from location to location.</li><li>Too many times I have visited where I see the people preping the sandwiches taking their sweet time when there 's a lineup to the door.</li><li>I thought the sandwiches were weird and soo messy and a bit expensive, but now I find I get a craving for one every week or two.</li><li>Simple menu consisting of Italian style sandwiches, salads, and coffees.</li><li>This place is bustling with the lunch crowd and they are churning sandwiches in the perfect assembly line.</li><li>This location unlike some of the other ones, does not offer pasta, pizza, French fries or have a hot table or have the mini sandwiches.</li><li>It does n't really matter to me that they do n't offer as much sides, as I could careless since there sandwiches are so filling.</li><li>I wish I could have one of their sandwiches everyday.</li><li>Some of them even said `` after I leave Toronto, I know I 'm going to have cravings for these sandwiches''.</li><li>Friendly staff and tasty sandwiches.</li><li>The menu is n't very big and consists largely of very sloppy sandwiches that have a surplus of salty tomato sauce on white bread.</li><li>Very large sandwiches and super filling.</li><li>Their sandwiches and fries are great.</li><li>Chicken place sandwich is one of the best sandwiches in this city !!</li><li>I think these are different than the Laffa that they use to make the sandwiches which look much bigger and softer.</li><li>They have a couple of other options but the sandwiches are boss.</li><li>Not miles better than Subway or anything, but they make a good milkshake and the sandwiches are alright.</li><li>These days when everyone is wild about gourmet, it 's refreshing to go back to basics and have good wholesome sandwiches.</li></ol></div><ul
