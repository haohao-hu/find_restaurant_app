<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 567' %><h2>chicken souvlaki<br />occurrence: 6</h2><div><ol><li>So this year I knew exactly what to order, the chicken souvlaki.</li><li>The chicken souvlaki was verrrrrrrrryyyyyy dry.</li><li>Our order- Greek salad to share, chicken souvlaki with home made pita, 4 topping medium pizza, and Greek wine. ( seems like those are the consistent recommendations by the staff) ... For a Greek restaurant, I was surprised to see that every table while I was there ( about 6 others) all ordered pizza, we figured it had to be really good for every table to have it, so we ordered it as well.</li><li>Our chicken souvlaki was tough, dry, and burnt black in some spots.</li><li>Came here for lunch as my favourite spot ( Triple Z) was closed; I really wanted to like this place as its so close to my work and the reviews are great, sadly I wont be going back .. had the chicken souvlaki and although it was moist the flavor was bland, no zest of lemon, no zing from garlic .. tasted like something I 'd get from a hospital cafeteria .. I guess I was expecting something comparable to Extreme Pita who do an amazing lemon souvlaki-ill go out of my way and stick with EP when I need my pita fix This was my first Pita Pit stop--so to speak--so I do n't have another to which to compare.</li><li>We had chicken souvlaki but everything my hubby tried to order they were out of.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
