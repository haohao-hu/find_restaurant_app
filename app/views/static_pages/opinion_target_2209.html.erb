<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 2209' %><h2>lobster grandin<br />occurrence: 2</h2><div><ol><li>Anyways, fine, we decided to change our order and get lobster grandin ( appetizer $ 12), garlic jumbo shrimp ( entree $ 32), and 1 1/4 steamed lobster ( entree $ 36) for now to see how the food is then get more later if we like the foods ( yes we were that scared).</li><li>FOOD: the food came pretty fast probably because we came as soon as it opened. garlic bread was alright- nothing special. lobster bisque ( $ 10) was pretty good- I think this is their specialty since the owner wanted us to try it so bad. lobster grandin ( $ 12) was alright.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
