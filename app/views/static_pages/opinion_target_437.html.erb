( makes me feel less guilty that I 'm having veg ... lol), and yes the sammies are huge!</li><li>Both of us ordered calamari one lunch one dinner size ( order the small there is not that much a difference for the cash), had sides of bland rice and undercooked veg that that knife could not even cut through.</li><li>I have been here for lunch a few times with groups from work and I think they have something for everyone- seafood, veg, different meats, styles and spice.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
