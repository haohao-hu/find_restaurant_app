<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 463' %><h2>rice noodles<br />occurrence: 10</h2><div><ol><li>The chicken is organic, stuffed with sticky rice on the inside and comes with a small side of rice noodles which you can place in the soup.</li><li>Their rice noodle w/ black bean beef is also well delicious ( I 'm a texture slut, so rice noodles are always a must for me @ SG despite them not being very hakka-esque) I could go on and on with dishes like the Peanut Chicken, Sizzling Shrimp and Spicy Spare Garlic Ribs, but yo just need to go and experience it for yourself.</li><li>Noodles were quite good but were thick rice noodles and not vermicelli as listed.</li><li>The congee was thick and not watery, the rice noodles had the wok flame taste and the fried dough was hot and crispy.</li><li>The flavour was alright but who likes to eat short little bits of rice noodles ?</li><li>Crispy beef curry ( golden curry of course), traditional appetizer platter ( chicken lemon grass sausage-varies- sometimes yummy sometimes really dry, beef satay, and spring rolls are all well made), coconut seafood curry-wow but little pricey, the chicken &amp; vegs rice- you might feel it too sour but I like it- not the chicken though; the steak dish--good, crispy duck leg- no, etc., fresh, nice presentation, and more of the restaurant quality than the Thai eateries we usually go for pad thai, flat rice noodles, one plate meals, which are, obviously not Linda 's specialities either.</li><li>But what I did not appreciate was that my rice noodles were clumped up/stuck together in the soup until I tried to separate them with my chopsticks.</li><li>Menu is small and focused on exactly what they do best- wontons, beef brisket, fish balls, wonton noodles, rice noodles etc.</li><li>Overall if you really want to eat here, just stick with the free rice noodles!</li><li>We ordered the seafood supreme bowl, rice noodles, salt and pepper squid and the stir fried taro squares.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
