<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 4098' %><h2>preserves cabbage<br />occurrence: 1</h2><div><ol><li>I liked that it was hot ( yes, I know I said it already), noodles were a little dry but the sweetness of the preserves cabbage saved it a little bit- place was clean, service was fast ( I went around 5:30-6)- probably it was midtown, prices were jacked up 1-2 dollars compared to uptown.- overall, you 're going to a diner and this place delivered what a Chinese diner needs to be.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
