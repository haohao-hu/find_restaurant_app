<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 163' %><h2>spider roll<br />occurrence: 40</h2><div><ol><li>Not-so-great eats for me have been: spider roll ( the soft shell crab is panko breadcrumb crusted instead of tempura fried, I find it does n't taste as good), sukiyaki ( raw meats and noodles cooked in broth fondue style) and bibimbap ( korean stone bowl rice dish, which was done poorly).</li><li>The sushi is great, especially the spider roll.</li><li>Spider roll ( $ 10.95)- deep fried soft shell crab, avocado, cucumber, flying fish egg &amp; Japanese mayo.</li><li>Also the tiniest spider roll I 've ever seen.</li><li>I had a selection of appetizers, sushi, sashimi and a spider roll.</li><li>Spider roll was novice, the sashimi was fresh but so what ?</li><li>Their maki rolls ( we had their spider roll) tasted pretty good, but again, meh, I 've experienced better.* cough* Inaho* cough* As a bonus, though, they have free parking behind the building, so yay for convenience!</li><li>We also shared a spider roll.</li><li>Some, like the spider roll, are just plain terrible.</li><li>Other AYCE sushi restaurants will give you proper sushi and Miso Soup, for an even lower price ( 11.99 on most places for weekday lunch hours). bf and i came here last Sunday afternoon and had the gold menu for AYCE. it was less than average especially for the price, $ 21.99 on weekends and holidays and does not include drinks except for water and tea. this is the only AYCE place that comes out with our order of sashimi last. the most disappointing part was the food. salmon sushi were huge and sliced in cubes, steak cubes came in bits and pieces but was decent, buttered mushrooms were burnt, masago was too salty due to low quality, beef tataki was not fresh, i think the kalbi ribs were old cause they were so chewy i couldnt chew through them, spider roll was the worst! i couldnt even drink the tea cause the cups had such a strong bleach scent. needless to say, we will not be returning and would not recommend it to anyone.</li><li>But wow ... great rolls esp the spider roll: D.</li><li>Also love the spider roll and sushi bong special.</li><li>Their dynamite roll and spider roll are the size my arm.</li><li>Spider roll is okay too but I do n't like crab.</li><li>The Sushi Bong Special ( $ 9.50) is well worth it as well as the spider roll.</li><li>I still come back from time to time, love their spider roll and many other rolls.</li><li>We had their spider roll and I think that was around 10 and then their spicy salmon which was around 5.</li><li>I came here twice and so far i 've tried spicy salmon roll, spider roll, dynamite roll, white tuna roll and they are all so good! i was sharing it with my BF and we still could n't finish it!</li><li>We ordered spicy salmon, dragon roll ( shrimp tempura) and spider roll.</li><li>The Spider roll was unconventional in that it contained egg, avocado, cucumber, salmon ( ?), and soft shell crab.</li><li>Tried the spider roll today and it taste great too!</li><li>Called for take out: red dragon roll and spider roll ( $ 20 cash).</li><li>I usually like one with spicy mayo sauce and crispy bits w the salmon.:) Their spider roll ( which I tried last time) was also delishhhh filled with crispy soft shell crab and surrounded with ample filling!</li><li>The spider roll is a giant thing, filled with tasty crunchy soft-shell crab:) Seating is a little limited, but not as limited as the parking in the roundabout.</li><li>Magnifico. was introduced to this place by my bro. if i need a quick sushi fix on the way downtown or coming back up ill usually stop by this place because its awesome. ive heard mixed reviews about their sashimi but i cant comment on that because ive only ever gotten rolls .. and let me tell u they do not disappoint! the rolls are huge with tons of filling as opposed to places that make rolls with tons of rice and totally gimp out on filling. they are VERY busy during weekdays so u might hve to wait ( prepare yourself). not a good place to dine in ... i would recommend take-out ( they literally have like 2 tables) Amazing rolls for a great price ( 1 spider roll and 1 dynamite roll come to just under $ 20 but thy are so big that 2 rolls fill up a box).</li><li>We ordered a spider roll and a hardroll rock.</li><li>The spider roll was so long, the whole roll could not be fitted across the container but cut in half.</li><li>Every time I order I get Dynamite Roll, Chirashi ( which is essentially Sashimi on a bed of rice), Spider Roll, and Sushi Bong Special.</li><li>Got the spider roll ( softshell crab), hard rock nroll ( bbq eel) and a seaweed salad.</li><li>The spider roll was super legit.</li><li>I love their Spider Roll.</li><li>The Spider Roll, basically deep fried crab with vegetables, was crispy but did not have enough mayo sauce which made the roll very dry.</li><li>I had a salad, spider roll and then green tea ice cream.</li><li>Sushi wise, it 's nothing special, the spider roll with soft shell crab is not that good actually.</li><li>Envision spider roll but add avocado and eel on top.</li><li>I always get their Spicy Salmon, Tuna Sushi and Salmon Sushi combo for lunch for $ 5.99! ( yes, and that is like 8 pieces of sushi for that price) and sometimes when I feel like splurging a little for lunch, I order their spider roll for like $ 14.99 i think- which is like my favourite maki rolls and this place is generous when it comes to the soft shell crab they stuff in that shit.</li><li>Spider roll was 15 dollars.</li><li>- Spider roll, while nice and crunchy, was overpriced.</li><li>A friend and I ordered four rolls- the Spider Roll, Philadelphia Roll ( my favourite), Dragon Roll, and Rainbow Roll.</li><li>Server got our order of sushi wrong, brought two plates of Green Dragon rolls we corrected him and said we ordered one of that and one Spider Roll.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
