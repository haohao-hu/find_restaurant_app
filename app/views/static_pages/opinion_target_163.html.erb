<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 163' %><h2>water<br />occurrence: 32</h2><div><ol><li>The pitcher that held the water was once clear, but turned yellow.</li><li>Bottom line, ask for your Iced tea James Bond style and watch the water works.</li><li>I usually find complaints towards general service inadequacies to be petty attempts at a more sophisticated restaurant review, but it literally took me more than 4 requests to two different servers including my own to have my water filled just once, and the overabundance of sodium in the dishes did n't help much either.</li><li>We would never expect to be seated for over 20 minutes without anyone so much as offering us water.</li><li>Spaghetti- portion smaller than i expected 4 jumbo shrimps that tasted very shrimpy, had an ocean water taste like it was not rinsed.</li><li>The service has mainly been good, but slower on the patio where it can take longer to get a drink and you might have to ask more than once for water.</li><li>Just a little room for improvement in the customer service at the table. just give a little water refill ...:-).</li><li>The water was warm, I guess ice water is extra.</li><li>The only good thing is the consistency of the drink: not too thin/watery but not too thick/milky- too thick can be off-putting while too thin can make it feel like you 're drinking water than milk.</li><li>Service was impeccable- fresh ground pepper and fresh parmesan ready on standby, water refilled without even asking.</li><li>The food also took a bit longer to get to us, but our water was always filled and people were always checking on us to make sure we were okay.</li><li>The amount of water they mixed in with the latte is ridiculous.</li><li>They had those buttons on the side sign type of thing which u can press for the server, water, and any questions.</li><li>Also, the water was not even served until 10 minutes after we were seated and it smelled really strongly like chlorine !!! or some other chemical! like realllllly strong- we all could n't drink more than a few sips.</li><li>Water was quick, but everything else including side dishes took forever.</li><li>The owner explained that they pour water in before serving because the plate is sometimes too hot and it will burn the food.</li><li>We had to ask million times for menu, tea, water, bill etc. we were very unhappy about the service and left a small tip.</li><li>We had to walk all the way to the back of the restaurant and asked for everything that we needed, table, water, food .... our server wasnt friendly and got some attitudes.</li><li>Where are my side dishes and water ?</li><li>How rude you should be to not bring side dishes and water ?</li><li>Pros: Has lunch specials and dinner specials, food came out quickly, tempura and japchae was yummy Cons: miso soup was too salty, the waitress sat me in a booth and did n't check up on me once the food came, did n't get a water refill, no banchan or kimchi, skimped on the Kalbi for the lunch special If you 're looking for a place in the area that serves Korean food for the same price, your best bet would be the Seoul house on Orfus Rd. You might said I 'm picky but I do n't think I would come back to this place.</li><li>By the way, if you ever wonder why the waiter pour water in the rice stone after transferring the rice in the bowl, here 's the reason: like most non-korean people, we would think that they pour the water to easily clean the stone, but in fact, you should be eating it.</li><li>Cutlery, plus trays, and water is all self-service.</li><li>Service is minimal, basically give you what you need, the menu and water when you sit, chopsticks and bowls after you order.</li><li>The problem is the water is n't that hot, so the tea bag does n't completely soak.</li><li>Last time there, it was so bad that we did n't get the water, bowls, spoons and simple utensils requested.</li><li>Water was not served and had to be asked for.</li><li>Had to ask for the essentials; water, table setting, even wasabi and ginger ( which is essential for sushi restaurants ??).</li><li>The biggest problem for me is that the tea and water to taste like soap- either the teapot or the cups are not rinsed thoroughly ... this is extremely off putting and hard to ignore when evaluating any restaurant.</li><li>The server was friendly in the beginning, coming back with side dishes and water.</li><li>I 'd say stick to beer, water or soda pop. Moving into the buffet portion of GHMG, I was really impressed with the organized lay out for food and the overall freshness and organization of the Mongolian BBQ area.</li><li>Who knew rice and water could be so tasty ?!</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
