<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 496' %><h2>seat<br />occurrence: 9</h2><div><ol><li>Good thing is that you will always get a seat here, was pretty empty when we went but maybe because it 's the weekends ?</li><li>I 'd say any time you arrive before 11am, the easier it is to get a seat.</li><li>Not many people know about this place so usually you can always get a seat when you come in.</li><li>I feel like any brunch place gets packed really quickly, so do n't even know how early one would come to get a seat!</li><li>Was it ever packed, had to wait 20 mins to get a seat.</li><li>- The only possible reason to go there is to get the coffee and muffin for $ 1.98 deal, sit at the best seat ( whichever that is) for hours on end, drinking the free serve yourself water ( with a new cup each time), and choke the free wi-fi torrenting movies ... ( yet to try all this but its on my list).</li><li>When we arrived we were lucky to get a seat because every table was full.</li><li>The place is small seat may be 10 people, take out is available, and all the backing is done on site.</li><li>It 's popular with the business crowd in that area throughout the week, though never really too busy not to get a seat.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
