<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 149' %><h2>crab<br />occurrence: 35</h2><div><ol><li>The name to me sounded bizarre but it had crab and shrimp and was actually quite good!</li><li>Since we 're cutting out one of the most expensive ingredients in Chinese cooking -- shellfish like lobster, crab, abalone -- I would have expected the chef to choose ingredients that are finer or of higher quality or just special in some way to substitute.</li><li>First of all, it 's almost impossible to find the proper type of crab that wo n't break your teeth ....</li><li>Seeing the tomalley and roe just make us salivate even more and we could n't wait to give it a try =) The crab itself was pretty good, however the marinating sauce was a bit too ordinary.</li><li>While the crab was fresh, there was no other flavors such as sweet or salty and the crab was just .. bland and spicy.</li><li>While the crab was fresh, there was no other flavors such as sweet or salty and the crab was just .. bland and spicy.</li><li>This place has korean raw crab `` Ge-Jang'' that is one of my absolute favorites.</li><li>Food: 9/10- raw crab: 10/10. love it!</li><li>Gen was a big fan of the special soy sauce blend and taught us to eat it by taking some of the rice and putting it into the shell of the crab in order to use up the soy sauce blend.</li><li>The difference between cooked crabs and raw crabs is that the meat in the raw crab was very gooey, with its texture and consistency similar to that of egg yolk.</li><li>It also took a bit of time to chew through the shell and legs of the crab in order to eat it.</li><li>They have sauced crab.</li><li>Second time, we tried the crab, the recommended one year old kimchi soup, and seafood tofu soup.</li><li>The crab was quite expansive and it was not worth it.</li><li>And sexy summer rolls are the non-fried ones- they have avocado, lettuce, crab or shrimp, other greenery and come wrapped in a see through rice paper. yummmmzeeerrrzzzzz The staff at the Sheppard and Yonge location are super nice.</li><li>THE ROLLS- standouts were the green dragon, volcano and spicy crab.</li><li>It featured good quality pasta, and an assortment of well-cooked seafood, including scallops, shrimp, crab, clams and mussels.</li><li>I 've tried places with their crab fried rice and its always good but I did notice that this restaurant does n't get stingy when it comes to putting the crab in your rice !!</li><li>So each spoonful I taste -- i get lots of crab meat in there** real crab, not crab meat* !!</li><li>My boyfriend is a bit of a seafood connoisseur, so after eating crab and lobster a dozen of times at Chinese restaurants, Red Lobster and at home, we decided to go for something different.</li><li>The `` crab'' in it did n't really taste like crab, plus it was battered and deep fried and it just made the dish feel too heavy.</li><li>Will definitely be coming back !!- when there are loads of chinese folks as patrons, you 've come to the right spot.- definately try their house super bowl congee ( shrimp, scallop, salmon, grouper, crab, surf clam) and the fried chili turnip patties ... you will not regret it.- will definately be back.</li><li>The crab was n't really detectable until I added salt.</li><li>I ordered the Super House Congee- it came with shrimp, crab, salmon, scallop, grouper and green onions.</li><li>Deep Fried Wonton ......... 10/10 Soft shell crab fried rice was a pleasant surprise even though the amount of crab was not that great.</li><li>The spider roll is a giant thing, filled with tasty crunchy soft-shell crab:) Seating is a little limited, but not as limited as the parking in the roundabout.</li><li>The crab and the lobster were fried in the same tasteless junk probably used to grease door hinges.</li><li>Here are my favourites at this place:- Shrimp Tempura ( HUGE Shrimps with a nice crispy finish)- Red Dragon ( This roll is wrapped up in delicious smoked salmon)- Green Dragon ( a delicious combo of shrimp, crab and veggies wrapped up in fresh green avocado)- Golden California Rolls ( Not as healthy but it is fried to perfection and melts in your mouth)- Chicken Teriyaki bento box ( tons of food!</li><li>Here the crab and pork soup dumplings are the best.</li><li>Lobster, crab and shrimp.</li><li>( BTW ... the crab that is offered on a couple of the dishes is canned.</li><li>The novelty with the Mongolian Grill is that you are presented with a wide variety of raw meats ( beef, pork, chicken, and lamb) and vegetables, some seafoods ( shrimps, fake crab and squid rings), noodles ( egg, rice, udon, etc.) and a stupefying selection of soupy sauces ( spicy, curry, honey garlic ... more than 10 in total) and condiment sauces ( ginger, garlic, oyster ... more than 20 in total).</li><li>The congee was good, lots of seafood variety with salmon, shrimp, crab etc. the cantonese chow mein was mediocre, it 's my brothers fave so we end up ordering that but I felt the noodles were too crispy for my liking.</li><li>- Favorite congee: crab &amp; fish maw, or pork &amp; preserved egg.</li><li>I also ordered a crab and fish maw soup which was so bad that no one at the table would have any and I ordered a large bowl: ( It tasted like they were running out of soup and decided to reheat it and fill it up with water and egg white.</li></ol></div><ul
