<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 893' %><h2>chicken pie<br />occurrence: 4</h2><div><ol><li>Still, the food is so amazing and fresh, I still give this place FIVE STARS ALL DAY, SON!*****. the place is very clean. the fish i had was very fresh and the batter was very crispy. we also ordered the chicken pie which was good but the pie was taken out of the fridge in front of us and taken to the cook to be heated up. nothing special about the pie, a bit expensive in my opinion. it cost more than the fish. chips, fish and whatever has to be ordered separately. we did get free slices of brown bread with butter on the side. i just wish that they give a bit more on the plate than just a fish. weird.</li><li>All very good and the chicken pie was delicious!</li><li>The chicken pie is especially delicious with a nice balance of crust, creme, chicken and veggies.</li><li>I like their chicken pie: moist shredded chicken and vegetables topped with mashed potatoes.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
