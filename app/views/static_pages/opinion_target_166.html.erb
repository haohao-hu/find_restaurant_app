<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 166' %><h2>tuna<br />occurrence: 40</h2><div><ol><li>The salmon was really good, the tuna was terrible and left uneaten.</li><li>White tuna, red tuna, salmon, etc.</li><li>Again, I praise the variety, as many other restaurants will give you a load of salmon, tuna, red snapper, and maybe one other type of fish if you 're lucky.</li><li>There was pretty much no variety of sushi fish, with only salmon, tuna, red snapper, and shrimp.</li><li>Their small sashimi dinner was very standard ( salmon, tuna, tai, hamachi) nothing outstanding.</li><li>When the salad came, I had to ask the waitress if the `` TINY'' pieces of the red stuff was the tuna.</li><li>I 'm used to the larger portions of leafy greens and huge chunks of tuna, salmon etc from Sushi On Bloor and the price is only $ 7.95.</li><li>I would suggest the Rosemary 's Sunday ( because it had a little bit of everything; from eggs, sausage and home fries to pancakes) or the tuna melt.</li><li>We come here every weekend, the salmon and the tuna are always spectacular.</li><li>The selection was awesome- we opted for 2 maki and temaki sets ( A &amp; C), and the Tiger Roll ( Tuna, Avocado, Cream Cheese, wrapped in Salmon).</li><li>We split the assorted regular sashimi which came with salmon, tuna, surf clam, and some sort of white fish.</li><li>And after she took it back another woman came to my table and asked me if I ordered tuna ( yes) then another 10 minute wait to fix it.</li><li>Besides the usual sashimi slices of salmon, tuna, and tai, there were also warm saucy unagi slices and mini nigiri of spicy tuna mixed with crunchy tempura bits all laid out scrumptiously on a bed of sweet and vinegary warm rice.</li><li>There 's a good selection of healthy foods, including quinoa, couscous, tuna, broccoli, salads and a wide assortment of fruits.</li><li>Tried a variety of fish, photo added is of salmon, white tuna, squid, and mackerel.</li><li>There is only really 4 things i order from this place. super chirashi ( approx $ 14) enough food for you to take some home salmon chirashi ( $ 10)- never failed me sushi chirashi ( great assortment $ 10) ( accept requests for substitutes if you dont like shrimp, white tuna .. etc) uni sushi ( $ 5/2PCS)- SUPER fresh and not available during off season service can be kinda slow at times and staff tend to be loud when the restaurant is empty and ive seen the kitchen staff sitting next to us eating their meals however, like one of the previous yelper said the chirashi keeps me coming back for more. parking is the worst part about going to this restaurant.</li><li>Their sashimi did not taste fresh, tuna seemed light yellow in colour and the salmon did not have an oily complexion or buttery taste.</li><li>Nicely seasoned and the outside layer was burnt to perfection to give you the rough edge texture, but at the same time, able to retain the freshness of the tuna on the inside.</li><li>The bagels were still hard, even though I can make a delicious tuna and egg salad ( unlike the rest of the people who go here) I did try it and it was horrible, dry and tasteless.</li><li>You also have all the other standards: scoops of tuna and egg, cream cheese, salads, lox, and BAGELS!</li><li>I got dynamite, spicy tuna and california.</li><li>Salmon, white fish, and tuna are the three you typically get which are enormous and will keep you full for a while.</li><li>I looked at the spicy tuna .. on, y the middle pieces have tuna in the middle.</li><li>Some of the tuna could be better cut to avoid silver slivers.</li><li>I always get the california, spicy salmon, and spicy tuna, all extra crunchy.</li><li>Presentation is absent but they make up for it in quick and speedy delivery of food, bundled with overly large rolls stuffed with raw salmon or tuna, or tempura, whatever most sushi lovers desire.</li><li>The tuna did taste a bit off/bland but it had the tastiest salad dressing.</li><li>I had the arugula salad ( you can add chicken or seared tuna) which was lacking acidity in the dressing but they were more than happy to rectify that with a dressing more to my taste.</li><li>I am a huge sushi lover and Ginza is my local sushi stop when I am craving my spicy tuna and red dragon rolls but do not wish to travel across the city.</li><li>For $ 39 you can get a platter of 48 maki rolls from Tako Sushi on Don Mills but the quality is sub-par and they 're just plain salmon, tuna, cucumber, and California rolls.</li><li>The tuna was very rough and I felt like I was chewing beef tendons.</li><li>We were also unable to eat the tuna and two other kinds of fish ( I 'm not sure what the names are), as they were also fishy and not at all fresh.</li><li>Spicy Salmon Roll/Salmon/Tuna ( $ 5.99)- 6 pieces of Spicy Salmon roll has quite a bit of salmon and Tempura bites- Salmon and Tuna are both standard- Rice has a good balance of vinegar, nice and bouncy chew ...</li><li>They do have tuna, tako ( octopus), and eel as part of their ayce selection which is a plus.</li><li>The spicy tuna and salmon looked old, and red dragon and dynamite broke apart in my chop sticks due to them being so loosely rolled.</li><li>So the breakdown on food: Falafel 's = very good, Sandwiches = ive had the tuna melt ( with feta cheese) and the tunisian to date which are both great.</li><li>4/5 Here are some of the Chef 's Rolls I had: Fantastic Roll 5/5- This one is my favourite, if you love spicy tuna, avocado, tempura bits and green onions this is the roll for you.</li><li>The Caterpillar roll had tasty BBQ eel and a flavourful combination with cucumber, avocado, and tobiko and the Alaska roll was straightforward with tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and avocado.</li><li>The other fish ( tuna, albacore, yellowtail) could have been fresher, but it was n't at the point of needing to outright reject them or call the health department.</li><li>Also, bring cash and you pay at the cashier. soooooo, did you hear about what happened to the goldsteins ? how about the shmaltzbergs son michael, i heard he got an earring! no ? really. what a hoodlum. oy a broch. this might make virtually no sense to you at all or it might make all too much sense to you and either way when you are eating in the cramped space that is bagel plus youll hear this conversation in any number of incarnations at much louder decibel levels than in this review. right at the lip of one of torontos jewish areas ( spanning from as far south as eglinton you might say to as far north as sheppard all along bathurst as its spine) sits this boisterous place thats half bakery and takeaway and half sit down. there are classic chopped eggs, tuna, lox, cream cheese, and herring. then they have a bit of middle eastern flair with falafel plates. the falafel are huge and crispy. they also, make a great spinach salad with a huge ice cream scoop of chopped egg- im sure you can get a huge scoop of just about anything on it. and just about anything you get, will come with, as you would expect, a nice big bagel. i always enjoy my food whenever i go- the menu has long been set and they do it well, but i could do with a little less all the bar mitzvah talk. but when in poland ...</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
