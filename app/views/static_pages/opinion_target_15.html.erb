5.95.</li><li>So I got the salad first.</li><li>The tart sesame salad dressing blends well with the salad.</li><li>Do n't throw the entire dressing into the salad, just do a little bit at a time.</li><li>The best salad i have ever had.</li><li>Me and my friend having trouble finishing that .... and there is nothing really Chinese about the salad ... aside from those fried noodles

Vince- he would have given me a free salad as an apology.</li><li>I was disappointed with the salad as it only had some not so fresh salad and pieces of stale, perhaps home made croutons.</li><li>I was disappointed with the salad as it only had some not so fresh salad and pieces of stale, perhaps home made croutons.</li><li>A small salad is $ 2.99 and not only do they really pack it into the container but you also have the choice of whatever salad or combination of salads you 'd like!</li><li>The only reason I bothered with the souvlaki was the salad, they used almost no cheese ( I understand with prices going up and whatnot) but the worst part was that they skimped on the cheapest ingredient.</li><li>Got the calamari ( super greasy and overcooked) and pork souvlaki ( the salad was the best part, potatoes were home fries and when I asked for the tzatziki it came with she had no idea what I was talking about and brought `` ranch'' that tasted nothing like ranch.</li><li>I

sushi restaurants they have lunch deals -- which are bento boxes of your typical beef, chicken or salmon teriyaki meat, rice, salad, soup &amp; fried tempera.</li><li>I was warned that there would be nothing for me to eat here besides the salad bar, but I figured that was an exaggeration- surely there must be some appetizer, composed salad, or pasta that was n't full of meat on the regular menu.</li><li>Tempura Combo ( $ 10.95)- Miso Soup/Salad and Shrimp Tempura, 5 pcs Sushi and 6 pcs Chef 's Choice Roll- My Shrimp and Veggie Tempura arrived in a bento box with salad, rice, gyoza and some fried items on the side.</li><li>My sister got the Beef Teriyaki Bento which included miso soup, salad, rice and sweet/sour chicken.</li><li>I got the Bulgogi Bento which included miso soup, salad, rice, salmon rolls and sushi.</li><li>I had the sashimi lunch special which is $ 9.95 and which came with soup, salad, 12 pcs of sashimi and 8 small rolls.</li><li>Mushy salad, with no olives

prefer the salad to rice and potatoes.</li><li>The best way to order is to get a sandwich and split a large greek salad with whoever you 're with, as I prefer the salad to rice and

choosing between fries and salad, I always go salad.</li><li>I ordered a salmon salad which was very tasty and a nice sized portion but I told the owner I was allergic to some of the ingredients in the salad and to not add them in and not only did she not listen but when I had to send it back, as opposed to taking new ingredients as should be done with allergies, she picked out all the allergens.</li><li>The salad I ended up receiving was delicious and my mom enjoyed her pear salad too which was a whopping $ 26 for the smallest salad portion I had seen in my life- it was so little that after she had to run to the grocery store and get a sandwich and it does not take a lot to power that woman!</li><li>The food came, and it was a crepe with some cheddar cheese melted on top, a salad and some other garnishings.</li><li>We also shared some ground meat kebobs, rice and salad ( $ 8) and a potato bolani ( $ 2.50) from Bamyan ( Afghan).</li><li>But if you 're not in the mood for bread, you can also have those sandwiches in a plate version without the bread &amp; with a side of salad, roasted veggies, or fries.</li><li>My fav was the salad that comes with every meal- the dressing is phenomenal ( more garlic)!</li><li>While the salad did n't fail my expectations ( phew!), my entree ( New Mexico Chicken) was dry, really dry.</li><li>Good pita, fresh salad, falafel was tasty ( but on soft side, I like mine crunchier).</li><li>Each main course includes a salad and pita bread. as well as a side dish.</li><li>They also offer a `` Business lunch'' featuring meat with a selection of sides and salad for $ 9.</li><li>The salad was well-dressed, with lots of feta cheese, big chunks of tomato, green peppers, and onions.</li><li>Perhaps the thing I liked the most was the salad.</li><li>The prices are alright, seafood platter which is like a sampler of seafood + halibut is around 16, comes with fries and salad.</li><li>This came wit delicate rice and a salad with the nicest dressing we 've had in some time!</li><li>Just paid an insane amount of money for what is essentially rice and ground beef cooked on a skewer ... did n't even include a salad for $ 13 !!</li><li>At about $ 8.50 each, you get soup, salad, 16 rolls, and in the winter they add 2 takoyaki, dumplings, or spring rolls.</li><li>Apps- Green Salad, pickled bitter melon- they use the Japanese sesame dressing and the salad is not drenched in water therefore it was good, and surprisingly i do n't like bitter melon but this was the only dish I ate most that night its good if you can bear the taste of bitter melon.</li><li>Chirashi don ( $ 15.95)- assorted sashimi on rice ( served with salad and miso soup).</li><li>Katsu don ( $ 9.95)- panko-crushed ( sic) pork with egg and onion, served with katsu sauce and rice ( served with salad and miso soup).</li><li>Salmon terriyaki dinner ( $ 11.95)- two pieces of salmon terriyaki served with miso soup, salad, rice, and mixed veggies.</li><li>My favourite was probably the sunonomo salad ( with seaweed) but on the pricer side for $ 7 ...</li><li>The salad was good but the dressing with a hint of garlic was a hit!</li><li>9/10- Have n't had the salad yet.</li><li>The salad, miso soup and ice cream are superior.</li><li>All the way from the miso soup, salad, all the way to the sushi and sashimi.</li><li>: ') The mushroom appetizer was great and the things we ordered came with crunchy noodle soups, miso soup and a salad.</li><li>Awesome salad to start- the dressing was phenomenally good!</li><li>The lunch bento box had great value as it included some Noodle appetizer, salad and miso soups.</li><li>For a group of 4 girls, the combination platter we chose was around $ 30PLUS and it was enough for all of us besides the soup and salad.</li><li>I ordered the Chirashi Dinner ( $ 18.85, comes w/ miso soup and salad).</li><li>The miso soup was pretty typical, however, the salad was better than the average salad that sushi restaurants serve.</li><li>The miso soup was pretty typical, however, the salad was better than the average salad that sushi restaurants serve.</li><li>It came with some appetizers: salad, soft noodles, and miso soup.</li><li>I absolutely love the dressing they make for their salad!</li><li>The lunch boxes came with: salad ( dressing was really flavourful. captured fruity and Asian flavours), mashed potatoes with teriyaki sauce, corn, and spicy mayo, a gyoza, rice.</li><li>The Spicy Chicken Dinner is served with a delicious citrus-laced salad and flavourful miso soup to start followed by a platter of skinless, spicy, saucy chicken on a bed of well-seasoned vegetables ( mainly onions).</li><li>I 'd say the quality IS good- the salad and presentation were a cut above what I 've seen elsewhere, but I did n't see the aforementioned `` lunch specials'' mentioned in other reviews.</li><li>Overall, just a crappy experience. been here only few times and always for lunch. lunch options are very good and at least vegetarian options are pretty cheap ( tofu bento box + soup + salad = $ 7). the food is yummy! and they have some interesting appetizers like avocado tempura! which is just delicious! the staff is friendly and helpful.</li><li>This has got to be the worst excuse for a salad.</li><li>Do n't understand why they sprinkled some crunchy stuff on the salad.</li><li>There was only iceberg lettuce in the salad.</li><li>This salad was not worth $ 6.00 never mind $ 11.95.</li><li>The place is good for a night out with friends if you just want to eat some sushi and over pay for the food. but for God sake, do n't order the salad.</li><li>Did I say that the size of the salad was miniscule ???</li><li>I started off with the Tomato e Bocceoncini and a nice Italian salad.</li><li>The tomatoes were nice and juicy and the cheese was very tasty, the salad was perfect with just the right amount of sauce to salad ratio.</li><li>On average they will have two or three different meat selections and salad and rice, after its gone they close down for the day.</li><li>I had a kebab plate with rice and salad and `` Ayran'' ( yogurt based drink).</li><li>I 've had their schwarma and kabab time special which comes with a assortment of meats and rice and salad and bread.</li><li>Coban Kaverma $ 11.99 This came with a salad, a basket of bread, the Lamb entree itself with rice ( although it did not mention it comes with it).</li><li>It may be better to eat the salad alongside the entrees rather than before.</li><li>My only suggestion is to have a larger salad!</li><li>The only thing that was not great were the fries, they were mushy because if the way the container is designed and the lettuce in the salad was turning red ( stale).</li><li>It was a very filling meal and pretty reasonably priced as I got a salad and some bread to go with it.</li><li>Both the salad and the pasta were of lunch size.</li><li>There is no food court in this mall, so if one does not want sandwiches and salad, Il Fornello is a good option ( the other Italian restaurant in the mall serves weekend brunch, so it is not a comparable alternative).</li><li>My biggest criticism of this place is that they should offer more vegetables with entrées like pizza and pasta and especially the salad.</li><li>The salad was good, but nothing to write home about.</li><li>On top of this, the large salad is $ 10 for a big bowl of lettuce with a few olives and tomatoes tossed in.</li><li>Laterna is a favorite spot of mine and the BF, when we are craving a simple souvlaki pita and a salad.</li><li>She recommended the greek salad to share and the souvlaki with homemade pita.</li><li>All about that salad, bout that salad, no joking!</li><li>I liked that the salad was n't overly dressed or too salty from a ridiculous amount of feta cheese.</li><li>Ibought a salad with two full eggs on it and enjoyed that too.</li><li>So far I 've had burger, fish and chips, souvlaki, lamb, seafood chowder, breakfast, wings, salad and so on and such, for which I have nothing but praises.</li><li>I really like the black sesame dressing on the salad.</li><li>The salad has a black sesame dressing which I really loved.</li><li>Their black sesame sauce on the salad was a nice change from the usual salads I 'm acquainted with.</li><li>I enjoyed the salad with the sesame dressing.</li><li>The salad is pretty good too, has a black sesame dressing, which I presume was bought from a grocery store.</li><li>I know ... I 've eaten here way too much! when i saw that falafels were being featured on Yelp this week, one word came to mind ... TOVLI. luckily i work in this neck of the woods, otherwise it would be pretty heroic ( but SO worth it!) to come up here for lunch from downtown! there is another location just south of wilson on bathurst, but i think that 's it. i love falafels, and i think that TOVLI has the best in the city. and yes it 's those sexy falafel sandwiches that i adore ... the falafel balls alone are pretty fabulous, but the sandwiches rock! stuffed full of their salad ( a kind of coleslaw) and your choice of pickled turnips ( my favourite) and such, they are HUGE and wonderful. definitely not for first dates or for in the car, these require 2 hands, lots of napkins and a good appetite!</li><li>Top picks: vegetarian poutine, mac &amp; cheese, plain pizza Other good choices: kol bol salad, split pea soup I 've been going here my whole life.</li><li>The menu said the carne asada just came with rice and salad but I was pleasantly surprised to find beans, tortilla and plantains with the meal.</li><li>I think every dish is under $ 20, with pupusas ranging from $ 2.50- $ 3 and they each come with a salad called curtido and tomato sauce.</li><li>I ordered their famous chicken shawarma plate, very very generous portion, included were chicken, rice, salad and sauces, like others said they dont skim on anything including the shaved chicken!</li><li>Rice and salad were very good, i dont know if i could swap the rice with fries or not as i think that would taste even better!</li><li>It does n't come with miso soup and salad, which is the first for the many sushi combo I tried.</li><li>Chicken Katsu was very crunchy as well and was accompanied by a refreshing salad ( Japanese cole slaw ?).</li><li>I have better sushi before but for the banchans and salad and dumplings that came with it was good value !!</li><li>My wife had a salad with a nicely cooked salmon filet that was she said was fresh and delicious.</li><li>I ordered the 12-piece Sashimi lunch special for an incredible $ 10.99; it came with a side of rice, noodles, two dumplings and the usual miso soup and salad.</li><li>The rice and roast are perfectly seasoned and the salad has a dressing to die for!</li><li>I suspect I should share a salad with my wife next time and order a pizza.</li><li>We ordered greek salad with tenderloin and ended up getting scattered salad with unseen feta cheese.</li><li>We ordered greek salad with tenderloin and ended up getting scattered salad with unseen feta cheese.</li><li>I always happen to order of filet de pescado ( fish fillet) that comes with a side of rice, salad, and sliced plantain chips.</li><li>It had chicken, rice, two types of potatoes, salad, tzatziki, and pita.</li><li>The salad was fine, lots of tomatoes and I do n't like tomatoes so I ate around them, sadly they stole all the feta in their nasty tomato trenches.</li><li>The Chicken Cobb salad has all the components of a good salad with fresh ingredients, complementary dressing ( this one had a bit of a kick from a hint of mustard) and filled my tummy up.</li><li>The Chicken Cobb salad has all the components of a good salad with fresh ingredients, complementary dressing ( this one had a bit of a kick from a hint of mustard) and filled my tummy up.</li><li>The steaks were cooked perfectly and came with loaded baked potatoes ( you could have other sides if you wanted- vegetable, salad other type of potato).</li><li>The meal included a choice of soup or Caesar salad.</li><li>I love Caesar salad and I love garlic, but this one had so much garlic in it, that as I continued it became close to inedible.</li><li>I did tell the server about the salad when she eventually reappeared, but I did n't want anything else.</li><li>3-4 star Speaking of the food, it was meh-ok, I had a salad with chicken breast and I found the chicken to be dry and overcooked, while the salad was pretty good and well dressed.</li><li>I ordered my entree first with salad but changed to baked potato but I guess she forgot to change it and it came out with salad.</li><li>I ordered my entree first with salad but changed to baked potato but I guess she forgot to change it and it came out with salad.</li><li>Fruits were ok but I would have preferred salad.</li><li>For mains, chicken curry, two filet mignons, ribeye steak and salad.</li><li>I order their veggie bento box, which comes with tempera, rice, salad, soup, a roll and a side dish ( different ones, depends on the day).</li><li>And the sashimi boats are always accompanied with miso soup, salad and a small dolop of green tea ice cream.</li><li>The salad had quite a lot of stuffings though lacked a bit of lettuce.</li><li>I got the spicy salmon rolls and lunch bento ( chicken katsu) with salad and two sides ( deep fried japchae roll and salmon).</li><li>Anyway, I ordered a roll set ( 2 rolls, plus salad and soup)!:) I could n't finish everything.</li><li>Came with a salad but no miso soup, which was disappointing.</li><li>Tried couple of sushi ( lunch combo B) that includes 3 sushi rolls, miso soup and small salad.</li><li>The plate came with white rice, a salad and miso soup.</li><li>My chicken teriyaki came with a small portion of glass noodles, some garlic marinated zucchini, some rice that was slapped into the box, and salad.</li><li>The soup was not that great and the salad was nothing spectacular, but not horrible either.</li><li>Those whose meals came with soups and salads went to the salad and soup bar.</li><li>After waiting a while my friends continued to get more soup and salad and even got some for the rest of us who were getting quite hungry.</li><li>I decided to give this place a try one evening and ordered a full portion lamb shish kebab, which came with rice, potatoes and salad, and I was floored by how amazing it was!</li><li>The GF ordered the Lamb Shish Kebab small dinner which comes with salad, rice, and potatoes as well.</li><li>The meat was not that gamey and the small was more than enough ( I believe small is 1 skewer while the large might be 2) The salad was good as it was doused with tahini sauce.</li><li>No idea how they make anything, but it 's an incredibly filling meal ( enough for 2 people to share if you 're not starving that day)- comes with a salad, lots of rice, and deliciously baked/grilled potatoes.</li><li>Meal came with salad ( pretty standard), garlic potatoes and rice.</li><li>The salad is fresh and the rice is yummy!</li><li>Therefore, On Sunday July 24th, 2016 at 19:30 I went there and tried the chicken and ground beef Kebob with rice and salad, I must admit that I really like the taste of all and really delicious.</li><li>The salad that came with the plate did n't taste that great due to the overwelming flavours of the dressing.</li><li>I wanted a healthy salad and got a flavorless meal I could make better at home.</li><li>More importantly, my wife loved the salmon salad that had a huge piece of salmon sitting atop the salad.</li><li>Salmon was done well, salad was too much like coleslaw for me.</li><li>Not sure if I would come back to eat here, I just was n't that impressed with the salad.</li><li>The chicken is nice and chunky and the salad is a good mix, try it with honey mustard dressing.</li><li>The general tsao chicken in the salad was very good.</li><li>The table got a salad to split and this really amazing spicy salsa which im dying to know what it was because it was so good.</li><li>My previous review, I ripped this place for the ridiculous amount of salad they gave out here with their food.</li><li>Nice portion sizes for Kabob with rice combos, it could however use a little bit more than just a chunk of Onion + herbs as `` salad'' I 'll most definitely recommend this place for meat lovers, but not so much for people that wants a more balanced meal.</li><li>We ate Soltani kabob with half rice and salad.</li><li>The salad, potatoes, and rice were average, but the meat was very unappetizing.</li><li>I had the salmon dinner which came with greek salad, rice &amp; potato.</li><li>Even though not all of us order set meals ( that include soup and salad), they still bring out soup/salad for everyone.</li><li>The boat comes with standard salad and miso soup.</li><li>It comes with salad and miso soup as appetizers, and a scoop of ice cream to end the meal ( I am not sure if they offer ice cream to everyone or just a big group).</li><li>Had: Shrimp tempura lunch set ( $ 8.95)- Comes with 3 pieces of shrimp tempura, 4 pieces of veggie, rice, soup, salad, and three veggie sides ( today 's were sesame oil broccoli, black peppered bean sprouts, and shredded potato with mayo.</li><li>I could n't even finish the salad actually because it was that big!</li><li>It has a variety of small plates ( soup and salad, sushi, sashimi, tempura, ginger chicken, terriyaki beef or salmon, terriyaki veggies, fried rice or udon, etc) for twenty something dollars.</li><li>They do allow you to share this menu, but the menu does only come with one soup and one salad ( if I 'm not mistaken), and if they bring you two of either one ( usually the soup), it means you 're probably not going to get the other one ( usually the salad), so you might want to clarify which one you want.</li><li>They do allow you to share this menu, but the menu does only come with one soup and one salad ( if I 'm not mistaken), and if they bring you two of either one ( usually the soup), it means you 're probably not going to get the other one ( usually the salad), so you might want to clarify which one you want.</li><li>I ordered the salad with a side of the lamb skewer.</li><li>My salad, was ok, but how do you fail a salad ? forget the lettuce ?</li><li>The problem I had was that they served the skewer to me after I finished the salad.</li><li>Pros Great Dessert Good food Not really any service Cons Meat came after the salad Looked stupid waiting for the waiter to take our order ... will look cool next time i guess.</li><li>The entree dishes come with salad, rice or fries, and a giant fluffed up pita bread brought piping hot to the table.</li><li>I also forgot to mention that while serving me the wrong salad that the server dropped garlic sauce into my lap and on my clothes.</li><li>The rice was quite bland and the salad wilted.</li><li>I upgraded my wrap to a combo with salad and pop. It came to a little over $ 10.</li><li>Their salad is old and wilted.</li><li>They do n't bother to keep it clean after a long day where there is salad spilling over everywhere either and sometimes their fruit looks dirty.</li><li>I have n't actually gotten any salads and fruits from here, but the one salad that I get with the breakfast is always decent.</li><li>In York Lanes ( the mall at York University) there is a great little salad and fruit bar that is the envy of all other eateries on campus.</li><li>We get the same things every time: a large pho with rare beef, brisket and tripe, a Vermicelli salad with either grilled pork or chicken, a small plate of spring rolls.</li><li>Add in the fish sauce, good balance with the saltiness, fishiness, sourness of the sauce and the freshness of the salad.</li><li>Avoid the chilled tofu, curry pork skewers ( 100% fat), and green salad.</li><li>There is a wide selection of sashimi, sushi, seared sushi, cooked ( pan fried) plates, tempura, grilled meats, soups, salad, and dessert.</li><li>So we got the `` Today 's Special'' which was chicken shawarma that comes with fries and a salad for 7.97 + tax.</li><li>So anyway, we got our order, and when we got home we noticed our salad was all wilted and warm when we got home .... The food preppers put the hot fries in the same box with the salad.</li><li>So anyway, we got our order, and when we got home we noticed our salad was all wilted and warm when we got home .... The food preppers put the hot fries in the same box with the salad.</li><li>For some odd reason, after having a chicken shawarma special with fries and salad for dinner my father and I had bad indigestion.</li><li>They offer up a decent sandwich menu, along with a daily soup, a daily muffin and a salad option as well.</li><li>Before they brought on the food, they gave several house complimentary dish such as salmon skin rolls, miso soups, salad, small cold noodle dish, deep fried oyster cakes and two kimchi dish.</li><li>This evening my husband ordered the Salmon Teriyaki bento box which came with 6 California rolls, yaki mandu as well as your typical soup, salad and rice.</li><li>It came with salad and miso soup.</li><li>Souvlaki, pita, salad, rice and the yummiest potatoes !!!!</li><li>The salad is fresh.</li><li>The sauces are rich and flavourful, and the produce in the salad tastes fresh.</li><li>The salad and bean concoction were both good additions to the plate but are not items that qualify to boost them to a three and hence a recommended eat.</li><li>I ordered the red curry lunch special for only $ 6.95- it comes with a salad and rice.</li><li>This particular employee just stood there did n't ask what salad I wanted.</li><li>I asked the man if there was a special and he told me that the special of the day was the chicken shawarma plate for 7.49 and that it came with chicken, rice, salad and potatoes.</li><li>Free: miso soup, tofu appetizer Bento box: tempura ( good), salad ( meh), 6 california rolls ( good), chap jae ( ok), bulgogi ( ok) My friend told me their chirashi is good and that their fish is really fresh.</li><li>I would have ordered another one, but I was helping my boyfriend with his Sashimi Dinner Set which comes with pieces of Salmon, Tuna and White Fish along with California Roll, salad, mixed tempura and cold noodles with a hint of Sesame Oil.</li><li>With a wealth of other sushi offerings on Yonge street it might be well advised to make a detour elsewhere. alway busy, like ram-crammed. the service tends to be a bit harried, but always friendly. the hae-dup bap is good here, if not typical. except they have two options: japanese-style or korean-style. js is chunks of fish and ks is slivers. personally, i prefer the ks, because the fish gets incorporated into the salad and rice so each mouthful is balanced. nothing to scream about- positively or negatively. just a good option. oh, the lighting is glaringly bright. do n't bring an ugly date.</li><li>It came with a miso soup, edamame, and the bento box ( rice, salad, chicken, tofu, japchae). everything was average; the sauce on the chicken teriyaki was overpowering.</li><li>They had 4 curries and tandoori chicken, a very basic salad ( just lettuce and carrots), naan and very basic indian dessert.</li><li>Koobideh kebab and rice ( and salad) for $ 7.99.</li><li>Lamb shank dinner with rice ( and salad) for $ 9.99.</li><li>Koobideh on a pita ( with salad) for $ 4.95.</li><li>( This place loses one star because the meals were supposed to come with salad, but neither did.</li><li>The salad was fresh &amp; the salad dressing was amazing.</li><li>The combo was supposed to include a salad, but I guess actually getting it depends on a dice roll.</li><li>The beef in the beef salad was average, although the salad itself did taste a little awkward because of the pairings of raw thai basil, cilantro and mint ( hard to pickup with a fork too).</li><li>It 's the upper scale to salad king with of course similar yet different menu.</li><li>I was expecting a very light, crispy salad ( I imagine baby lettuce and spinach and tomatoes and other crunchy watery things would complement the pomelo well ...) but what I got was lettuce with pomelo and SHRIMP ( !!) with some sort of peanut-cinnamon sauce, and hot peppers.</li><li>Thai iced tea was n't the greatest either. after eating dinner at Linda, s modern thai last night, I would not refer anyone who like, s good thai food to go there.the food is plan, and the portions are very small, well the price, s are high. dinner with two dish, s and a small salad was around seventy five dollar, s.we had to pick up food on the way home as we were still not full.there are so many better thai place, s in Toronto.</li><li>Starter ( listing from the best) 1) Crispy Papaya Salad- usually I do not order salad as a starter as I believe I can make it at home or nothing special could be in the salad.</li><li>Starter ( listing from the best) 1) Crispy Papaya Salad- usually I do not order salad as a starter as I believe I can make it at home or nothing special could be in the salad.</li><li>This salad proved me wrong. the fried papaya and the vinaigrette was to die for, it would definitely increase your appetite for the main course and dessert.</li><li>The meat was piled high and the salad and pickle were fresh and tasty.</li><li>The menu consists of shawarmas ( Lamb, chicken, beef), falafel, kebabs ( beef or chicken) in a pita or as a platter with salad, hummus, garlic sauce and rice or fries for the meat options.</li><li>The salad was lacklustre but not limp and decently seasoned.</li><li>The salad is tasty, the rice is great, and the portion is plenty filling.</li><li>The rice and and salad that came with it were excellent as well.</li><li>Although a veggie lover, I opted for the chicken kabob which came with a side option of either salad ( nothing extravagant, plain old garden variant) or fries.</li><li>Yum!- we had the fried eggplant and lamb which were good, but also the chicken schwarma which was rly dry and the flavors of the salad were meh- poor service, pricey- we saw the cook take pita off a pile of a customer 's leftover bread basket who had left, and put it in the pile to give to new customers: S Really disappointed with the place.</li><li>If in your plate, the beef, the rice and the salad is not good then I really do n't know what to rate this place as.</li><li>Yum I had the beef kebab, served with rice and lovely salad.</li><li>Came in for a Sunday lunch, we had:- lentil soup, really flavourful and filling- veggie platter of salad, pickled beets, falafel and pita My first time having falafel and I 'm really digging it.</li><li>The salad, hummus, falafel 's and chicken shawarma were very good.</li><li>The salad was nicely dressed and had good flavours.</li><li>All the meats, lamb, beef, chicken are very flavourful and tender.The rice and salad are very good as well.</li><li>It came with salad and rice.</li><li>The salad had a nice dressing.</li><li>I ordered the Baba Ghanough, Fatouche salad, Lamb skewers and an order of `` the best Falafels in Toronto''.</li><li>The highlight of the entire meal was the salad which was refreshing and helped balance the strong musky flavour of the lamb.</li><li>Scramble eggs were ah nothing special and the salad was just a salad with no special flavours.</li><li>The salad was wilted and my friend got the wrong dressing.</li><li>I always get 1.5 lbs lobster along with lobster bisque and salad.</li><li>We order a 1 lb and another 1.25 lbs steamed lobster together with a soup and a salad.</li><li>We usually get a lobster ( maybe 1.5 lbs) broiled, salad, fries or roast potato, drink, garlic bread and awesome lobster bisque.</li><li>The meal came with garlic bread ( Delicious but very buttery!), potato or fries or salad.</li><li>The salad is chopped, tasteless lettuce, with half a styrofoamy tomato on top, and your choice of Kraft dressing.</li><li>3./ Get your chef to go on-line and learn how to make garlic bread, salad, and dressing- if you ca n't find a bakery, just use Ace.</li><li>4./ You can keep your prices the same if you have a vegetable, salad, and potato or rice with the entree.</li><li>The salad is fine, the chowder is good, but everyone knows you need to go for a big creamy bowl of lobster bisque.</li><li>The water pitchers are cheap plastic ones, likely a dollar store purchase and the ramekin in which the dressing for my salad was provided in was certainly from a dollar store.</li><li>The salad was awesome to say the least.</li><li>Jimmy the Greek did an awesome job in cooking our meal and we filled our bellies with roast lamb and salad to our hearts content for under $ 25.</li><li>I have the Dinner ( chicken, pottos, meat, salad).</li><li>I ordered a chicken pita, I did n't see with salad or without salad options on the wall due to the little size of the word.</li><li>They asked me pita with or without salad.</li><li>The I told them with salad.</li><li>Delicious falafel balls, yummy salad and great selection of pizza slices.</li><li>Food is decent but does n't come with anything else i.e. No soup, salad, etc.</li><li>The sushi quality was very good and the salad and miso soup were spot on!</li><li>At least I was n't charged extra for substituting one of the sides for a salad.</li><li>I got home again and realized that this salad was spoiled as well.</li><li>I had to to go back and return it amd request that the manager smell the salad.</li><li>Why would he guarantee me the second salad is fresh when it was n't ?</li><li>Crunchy spinach salad ( $ 6.99)- I 'm hooked on this salad.</li><li>Even before coming, I considered getting this salad.</li><li>The salad was good and the shrimp were delicious.</li><li>It comes with a tiny side salad.</li><li>We also shared a salad and it was also very nice.</li><li>My salad aside from the seared tuna was extremely yummy.</li><li>The salad was also simple, with some grilled onions and other veggies.</li><li>We sat down for barely five minutes and already my friend 's pasta came out, funny how it beat the salad.</li><li>For a family of four we each had an entree, side salad and drinks ( Non-alcoholic).</li><li>This spicy salad which is usually a combination of thinly slices scallions and lettuce which you eat with the BBQ meat or in your diy lettuce wraps.</li><li>It was a thin cut of pork, that came with a salad, purple rice, and like 10 banchans.</li><li>For a bit over 8 dollars, I had yummy pork cutlet, filling rice and salad, and so many banchans I could n't even finish.</li><li>The salad that came with it was a container of iceberg lettuce and raw onion.</li><li>I ordered the lunch special which was chicken, rice, desert, naan and salad.</li><li>Third star is knocked off for the fact that my rice tasted like nothing ( not even like rice, more like paper), there were 3 pieces of chickens in my whole order and my salad was actually just chopped up onions.</li><li>I had the ground chicken kebob combo which comes with rice, salad, naan, and some sauce.</li><li>The salad is a little disappointing.</li><li>Cames with green salad, potato salad, palm hearts, one egg sunny side up, steak, bacon, provolone cheese, ham, olives, red pepper, tomatoes, mushroom, mayo.</li><li>The salad is very flavourful.</li><li>The crepe was just average, served with a light salad.</li><li>My friend and I both ordered a savory chicken crepe ( each of the savory crepe dishes also comes with a side salad).</li><li>The salad that accompanied the crepe was fresh and well dressed.</li><li>They have large portions and the crepes always comes with a side ( salad, ice cream ( !!!) etc) Their lattes are also very delicious with cute latte art on them.</li><li>That aside, there was a serving of salad that came with the Savoury Crepes options which was refreshingly nice!</li><li>My friend loves their sweet crepes, but I 've only ever had their savoury crepes, which are generously filled, and also come with a decent side salad.</li><li>The salad comes with a vinegary dressing, which I always ask for on the side.</li><li>In my opinion their savoury crepes are slightly better than their sweet crepes and they come with a salad!</li><li>We ordered the Chicken and Frankfurter crepes which came with a healthy salad.</li><li>My friend ordered a chicken crepe which came with a salad.</li><li>You also get a separate plate or container for salad which you can help yourself- the salad is quite plain though about 95% lettuce or you can take coleslaw or cheap pasta salad.</li><li>You also get a separate plate or container for salad which you can help yourself- the salad is quite plain though about 95% lettuce or you can take coleslaw or cheap pasta salad.</li><li>I have ordered from Albert for some catering events in the past but tonight I had the chance to sit down and dine on some jerk chicken, rice, and salad.</li><li>The salad was stone cold.</li><li>They have a really good special, not sure if its all day or just lunch- but pick a small sandwich, a drink, and garden salad or soup for $ 6.</li><li>We were a group of around 15 and arrived around 8 to a table set with about 40 dishes of shrimp cocktail, pickled herring, large plates of smoked salmon, beet salad, chicken pates, caesar salad, caviar and mini-pancakes, and much, much more.</li><li>They make a great club sandwich, a decent salad, and other office deli standards.</li><li>Cost is $ 28 and comes with a Dragon Roll, assorted Sashimi, fried rice, miso, salad, chicken teryiaki, and shrimp/veg tempura, and ice cream.</li><li>I had a salad, spider roll and then green tea ice cream.</li><li>A miso soup was 2.50 extra, salad probably more.</li><li>I do n't think I would return, but with a second TeamBuy voucher, and their unwillingness to refund it, I think I will have to! 10 piece sashimi lunch special with bowl of rice and also comes with miso soup and salad $ 10.95- the sashimi was fairly fresh but portions small Eel with rice $ 11.95- I have had AYCE eel with rice that tasted better than this.</li><li>Came with a very small salad and soy sauce.</li><li>It came with an app that had choice of edamame, salad, shrimp tempura.</li><li>The salad is a fresh difference from other sushi places due to the variety of vegetables used.</li><li>I ordered the spicy chicken teriyaki lunch box ( lunch boxes are available from 11am-3pm) which came with meso soup, few maki rolls, rice, salad, and few pieces of fruits ( check the photo below) teriyaki chicken tasted A-OK.</li><li>Our meals came with complimentary miso soup ( too salty IMHO) and salad.</li><li>And finally, the salad was light and refreshing with a side of really tasty dressing.</li><li>Also with every meal you order comes with miso soup, salad and green tea ice cream for dessert ( almost every meal).</li><li>The salad was covered in very unpleasant oil which made that not eatable.</li><li>I ordered a meal that came with soup and salad as take out and had to ask for my soup to be included and when I got home, realized salad was n't included.</li><li>However, every single Japanese/ sushi restaurant I 've ever been to- ALWAYS- gives a salad and miso soup to start and they only brought out one set which I thought was strange.</li><li>So I asked for an additional one so we didnt have to share a soup and salad that was smaller than the size of my fist.</li><li>When we got the bill, we saw they charged $ 1.99 for an extra miso soup and $ 2.99 for an extra salad !!!</li><li>I bring that up with the server that if the USUAL complimentary soup and salad were extra charges then they should have mentioned that when we asked for it before bringing it out.</li><li>Then he continued to argue with me saying at first that ALL Japanese restaurants charge for extra miso soup and salad.</li><li>Shortly after ordering received side salad and miso soup no Korean side dishes.</li><li>The fish came in a tower shape, with flying fish eggs, over a delicious salad.</li><li>The salad was fixed with really thin stripes of the herbs, it was deliciously fresh and crunchy.</li><li>I find most meals will come with a salad and miso soup.</li><li>My favourite though is the hwedupbap ( basically a salad with raw fish).</li><li>Had the BLT with salad.</li><li>My friend had a handsome looking mushroom and mixed green salad- not something I would expect to find at a diner.</li><li>No salad.</li><li>We ordered some rolls and a katsu udon to share and some miso soup and salad.</li><li>The soup and salad were fine, but the rolls were small.</li><li>Quality for the fish is quite good ... as my lunch specials though does not come with any salad or miso soup ..</li><li>This combo also included miso soup, salad, shrimp tempura ( and some vegetable tempura), and ice cream.</li><li>We got one of the boat specials which also came with soup, salad, dessert and shrimp tempera, and added in a chicken teriyaki bento box.</li><li>It comes with beef ribs, rice, spicy salmon roll, miso soup, and green salad.</li><li>Food ( Lunch): Besides the cooking table I have been for lunch service and ate the chicken-bento-box with soup, small salad, 4 sushi rolls, rice and tofu.</li><li>Ordered the pork Katsu arrived with hard pork no rice or salad.</li><li>Teppanyaki Ume ( see picture) is a very good full lunch which includes soup, salad, shrimp appetizer, rice, veggies, chicken and steak.</li><li>Your choices are: burrito, burrito bowl ( for anyone still on the Atkins diet), tacos ( hard or soft, I like it hard), salad, or nacho platter.</li><li>All menu items ( burrito, salad, bowls, etc) are under $ 10.</li><li>You can get salad, wraps, chicken, etc.</li><li>They use to have a ton of salad dress varieties, but lately it 's been pretty sparse.</li><li>I got a nice big salad and a chicken skewer for about $ 6.</li><li>I ordered the Spicy Chicken Dinner which comes with salad and white rice.</li><li>As you work your way through the chicken and salad, the rice ends up being coated in a mixer spicy BBQ sauce, garlic sauce and which ever salad dressing you chose ( ranch for me!) leaving a sloppy mess of yumminess at the end.</li><li>My salad was left out but I got it to go on the way out.</li><li>I 'm not going to make a scene, quietly flagged down the manager and told him the issue, took it back and it took 25 mins for a new salad to come back ... we asked once in the number of interruptions we got if the salad was ever going to come and we just got brushed off.</li><li>The salad is huge and good for 2 people or 1 really big eater.</li><li>I ordered a small salad for $ 5 Canadian and the burger was advertised as $ 5 so I said okay.</li><li>The salad came and seriously it was like airline small ... tiny little salad that came out of a pre-mixed bag with nothing else.</li><li>There were barely any fries on the wrap plate and barely any dressing on the salad.</li><li>Seasoned well and just delicious and his salad was good too.</li><li>It comes with small salad with no dressing, potato and few fruits.</li><li>Also salad was really dried that I felt like I was eating wet paper.</li><li>My salad was a bit overdressed, but that 's my only complaint.</li><li>There you go, no hair in your salad now ....</li><li>But we 're still going to charge you the $ 1 dollar for the salad upgrade ...</li><li>The salad had char marks from the grill and to TOP OFF THE EXPERIENCE a HAIR WAS FOUND sitting under the salad !!!</li><li>They have a lot of sandwiches to choose from but if you are the one person in the group that wants a salad ( like me), you are stuck with a garden salad.</li><li>They only have the one size sandwiches and as for sides they have salad, olives and dried sausage.</li><li>The bento boxes include salad and dumplings.</li><li>The chicken is perfectly grilled with lots of sauce and is accompanied by delicious roasted potatoes, salad ( I ca n't get enough of this dressing!), their amazing glass noodles, rice and miso soup.</li><li>I 'd really like to know the secret to their dressing, in fact I 'd probably order a whole dish of their salad if I could because it 's soo YUMMY!</li><li>I got the chicken schnitzel box with basmati rice and me salad.</li><li>I love their Me salad and dressing, the grilled chicken skewers were very good and moist!</li><li>Comes with Me salad and tahini.</li><li>I always order the `` ME salad'' with a side of tahini and a side of hotsauce and then I get an order of hummus for protein which comes with their laffa bread.</li><li>It 's a decent sized salad and I 'm quite satisfied.</li><li>I ordered the chicken breast skewers box with grilled veggies and greek salad.</li><li>The salad was absolutely divine! ( And I never thought I 'd use that word to describe lettuce!)</li><li>Me salad was not good at all and the produce was not fresh.</li><li>Could n't even start on my side salad.</li><li>I usually do n't like salads but the `` ME salad'' was exceptionally great and the ingredients complimented each other well.</li><li>We ordered the grilled chicken dark skewers box with fries and a ME salad and a chicken shawarma laffa wrap.</li><li>Ordered kebabs, comes with saffron rice and salad, and some extra garnish of veggies on the side.</li><li>Rice and salad was wonderful.</li><li>Today I felt like having half salad and their garden salad is typical iceberg with thousand island dressing ( do n't recommend it).</li><li>Soup was great, the salad not as the mango was not fresh.</li><li>Baked Almonds Crusted Woolwich Goat Cheese with grilled Portobello mushroom, wilted spinach, Honey raspberry dressing ( vegetarian) Char-Coal Broiled Lamb Shank Slowly cooked with scallion mashed potato, red wine, garlic, and rosemary Black And White Cakelet Devil 's food chocolate cake bean mousse, dark chocolate ganache Absolutely LOVED the salad ( must be the goat cheese!) and the lamb was excellent.</li><li>The salad is very good.</li><li>The salad had a nice presentation and was fresh.</li><li>I had the salad to start, very tasty.</li><li>They had miso soup but seaweed salad and short ribs ( AYCE sushi favorites of mine) are only available for dinner so I was a bit disappointed.</li><li>Hand washed and cut salad, nice.</li><li>If you 're into octopus and chickpea salad, they 've got it too.</li><li>The order included a falafel buffet platter, and side greek salad.</li><li>I like that their salad is slaw-based, which is a departure from the norm.</li><li>The food is decent, the ordering system is messed up but if you want a slice of pizza, a falafel, a shakshuka, or a massive salad then is is your place.</li><li>All the specials came with salad, miso soup, rice &amp; green tea ice cream.</li><li>When you order a teppanyaki meal, you get soup, salad, the meal, and desert.</li><li>In the past, when you ate at the Teppanyaki table, you would get an inclusive dinner .... salad, main course, dessert.</li><li>Actually feels a bit like a rip off since a small soup or salad is usually complimentary at fancier a la carte Japanese restaurants.</li><li>They charge extra for the salad where other places offer it as part of your meal.</li><li>No salad.</li><li>Salmon was juicy and salad was fresh and crispy.</li><li>I ordered the Fish Sandwich &amp; hubby had the chicken tenders to start &amp; then the thai wrap with greek salad as a main.</li><li>We got it sorted out eventually, and both my Thai pineapple pork and that guy 's salad were good.</li><li>It was topped with a fresh salsa, and accompanied by a salad, rice pilaf, refried beans and two homemade tortillas.</li><li>Seaweed salad- not the wakame kind ( the Japanese one that 's a very bright green and looks kinda like jelly).</li><li>The lunch specials are served in bento boxes and your meat selection is served with sticky rice, cold noodles, a very small salad, and a slice of orange.</li><li>The rice, cold noodles, and salad were serviceable but forgettable.</li><li>You should also try the Spicy Maki Bento during lunch hours: 6 spicy salmon + 6 spicy tuna + salad + miso soup + an orange.</li><li>There was also a bowl of miso soup, green salad, and sliced orange provided.</li><li>It was unpleasant that we were charged more than the price of a single salad to change from one salad to another for two people, and without being informed that would be the case in advance, so I feel I do have to point that out.</li><li>It was unpleasant that we were charged more than the price of a single salad to change from one salad to another for two people, and without being informed that would be the case in advance, so I feel I do have to point that out.</li><li>Both boxes come with green salad, miso soup and single serving of ice cream.</li><li>I ordered take out and there was a bug in our salad.</li><li>I should have probably read the reviews on yelp before going to the restaurant .. but I did n't .. .. btw before i get started why is there filtered reviews ? maybe i missed something ..; anyways went here for lunch with a co-worker because its close to the office .. the decor is okay and we were quickly seated but thats as good as it got .. none of the staff make eye contact, everything is slow even tho the establishment was n't busy, there was just no importance on quality .. we ordered one of the lunch specials, the pricing is good, but I learned a long time ago, you get what you pay for, so for $ 7 to $ 15 you can get a salad, appetizer, sushi, chicken/beef, dessert, etc the food was cold and really average, they forgot our sushi and when we pointed it out to the manager he said he would take it off our bill .. a whole $ 1.20 ?? for 6 sushi rolls .. like i said u get what u pay for .. my co-worker, who is from hong kong blasted the manager, but he was no help ... so i will never go back .. but the experience got me back to using yelp!;) The food is not great but the price is ok.</li><li>My boyfriend and I went here and I felt that we got this great deal on a shared meal that included:- a medium sized lobster cooked or as sashimi- tempura- rice x2- lamb rack- salmon filet- mussel soup x 2- salad x2 This entire meal would 've been around $ 60 altogether, which I think is a great deal!</li><li>For the main I had the set course curry tiger shrimp dinner ( $ 10.50) which included miso soup, salad, steamed rice, a bowl of thick slightly spicy curry ( it was alright) and four pieces of breaded tiger shrimps which were okay- the breaded batter was too thick.</li><li>The salad was over-dressed to the extent that there was a pool of dressing at the bottom of the bowl.</li><li>A meal for about $ 15.00 will include a platter so salmon sushi and California rolls, salad, miso soup, tempura, teriyaki steak, grilled pork and the list goes on.</li><li>I love their `` Kyoto'' deal which comes with maki ( 3 california rolls, 3 cucumber rolls), chicken teriyaki, salad, rice, miso soup, 2 spring rolls, steamed vegetables, and desert.</li><li>$ 19.95 for a half lobster, appetizers and a main with salad, soup etc.</li><li>One of us ordered a large salad and had coffee.</li><li>The Highlights:- This place is gorgeous both inside and out- Ample amount of seating for both small and big groups- The waiters are all very professional and seasoned in the food serving business ( you wo n't find your neighbor 's 16 year old kid working here)- Free hors d' oeuvres at the start of your meal ( pickles, olives, cottage cheese, and garlic bread)- Reasonable prices ( all main entrees come with a salad or soup of the day ... a good amount too)- Parking is a plenty and free- Desserts are made on site and delicious ... and you can get it for a low price- Bottomless coffee for $ 1.75- Quiet so you can carry on a conversation with your dining companions I will definitely be back.</li><li>Before, every main course came with a salad or soup appetizer ( no additional charge).</li><li>So, soup ( the daily soup option) is an additional $ 6 and change, and then salad, a whopping $ 9 and change.</li><li>But the salad and soups are still the same- they come in that mid-sized plate and all you get for the salad are iceberg leaves and sauce.</li><li>But the salad and soups are still the same- they come in that mid-sized plate and all you get for the salad are iceberg leaves and sauce.</li><li>We had salad, steak and tiramisu.</li><li>The garlic bread was freshly baked and delicious but at the end of the night it was a bit too much garlic combined with Caesar salad which was also full of fresh garlic.</li><li>Unbelievable I 've been coming here all the time and they just told me that they will charge me extra for all you can eat pork belly for the salad which was our first one and said there 's a new rule if your not into serving customers all you can eat do n't offer it honestly I 've been here all the time learn how to treat your regulars certainly never coming back here.</li><li>The mayo might have been for the small salad on the dish but it was so good w/ the dumplings!</li><li>I felt stuffed as soon as I ate the 8th dumpling ( they gave me 12pcs with a small salad).</li><li>We got some water and plates, and a tiny portion of salad to share between 4 people ...</li><li>Our side dishes and salad came of which I was not overly impressed with and after picking at random things, decided to leave the lot of them.</li><li>The salad consisted of shredded cabbage, sliced apples and oranges and had a very nice dressing.</li><li>The salad was nice albeit a little difficult to eat because the cabbage was sliced so long and the Gyoza was really tasty.</li><li>The set menu comes with salad, soup, main and your choice of cake.</li><li>The salad was nothing special, BUT this was the first time I tried ' heart of palm' which is exactly what it sounds like.</li><li>I think not.You get the point right ? Now I 'm questioning every item on their menu.Well, do n't be like me.Just do n't eat their food.Find something else. went there with a friend for lunch, it was buffet. the place was quite small but with a lot of places to sit! they have large tables too! the service was great, fast and friendly people. the buffet include: one soup 2 or 3 salad options many dips and sauces 1 rice 3-4 kind of vegetable dishes 5-6 meat dishes ( include chicken, lamb, beef, shrimps) they also have bread ( nan) and appetizers ( could not remember the names) they also have desserts ( 2 kinds) and fruits the taste was very good and not too spicy, however they have really extreme spicy sauces! the price was around 10 dollars as a neighborhood restaurant it one of the best options in the area and for sure I 'll be back:) This is a late review, I 've been a bit behind with all my travels = D I 've been to this place twice and the first time it was meh, I did n't even want to bother with a review.</li><li>Non Veg App Platter- Reshmi Kabob, Chicken Pakoras, Veggie Pakoras, Samosa, and a touch of salad.</li><li>The food is amazing, right from the salad, to the pickled goods, to your main dish.</li><li>As accompaniments, you have the option to choose between fries, rice or salad or a mix.</li><li>I ordered the Harvest Special along with a greek salad.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
