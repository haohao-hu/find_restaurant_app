<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 15' %><h2>rice<br />occurrence: 506</h2><div><ol><li>Mt girlfriends family has made a tradition of going here every year for dinner on New Years Day ( why we keep going when one of the kids got their meal AFTER everyone else ate last year) Anyways, I tried a few things on the menu until I came across the souvlaki ( the meat, veg and rice was nothing special, but wow did I ever fall in love with the dressing on the Greek salad).</li><li>Choose noodles or rice then choose your protein then choose your sauce and you 're done.</li><li>Bistec carne frita: Typical Chilean dish, served with flavorful rice, beef steak, veggies.</li><li>Overall 2/5 portion was good, price, and taste of the rice was lovely, the beef was a bit bland, and presentation was satisfactory.</li><li>I normally get a bulgogi dinner box which comes with sashimi, dynamite rolls, rice, bulgogi, green salad, miso soup, potato and chap chae for $ 11.95.</li><li>Like most sushi restaurants they have lunch deals -- which are bento boxes of your typical beef, chicken or salmon teriyaki meat, rice, salad, soup &amp; fried tempera.</li><li>The noodles and rice were cooked to perfection.</li><li>The rice was ... long grain, loose, not hot enough and not flavorful.</li><li>Had a dinner combo: soup, dessert, rice and spare ribs for ~ $ 7.</li><li>I usually order the combo specials ( $ 6.99ish depending on whether you want rice or noodles and such) which included a bubble tea and a small dessert.</li><li>Interesting combination, but the yellow fried rice with scallions and strips of beef also in made it some of the best rice I 've ever had.</li><li>It was a large portion of rice too, and I almost finished it.</li><li>The chef had basically de-boned a whole chicken, roasted it till it was perfectly done -- the chicken was moist and tender, but the skin crispy -- including the stuffing which was pearly white tender grains of rice.</li><li>Tempura Combo ( $ 10.95)- Miso Soup/Salad and Shrimp Tempura, 5 pcs Sushi and 6 pcs Chef 's Choice Roll- My Shrimp and Veggie Tempura arrived in a bento box with salad, rice, gyoza and some fried items on the side.</li><li>My sister got the Beef Teriyaki Bento which included miso soup, salad, rice and sweet/sour chicken.</li><li>I got the Bulgogi Bento which included miso soup, salad, rice, salmon rolls and sushi.</li><li>The best way to order is to get a sandwich and split a large greek salad with whoever you 're with, as I prefer the salad to rice and potatoes.</li><li>I got Combo #1: 1 dish, 1 rice and a drink.</li><li>We also shared some ground meat kebobs, rice and salad ( $ 8) and a potato bolani ( $ 2.50) from Bamyan ( Afghan).</li><li>The rice was long grained with carrots and raisins and spiced to perfection.</li><li>The rice also had a strange quality to it and was very offputting.</li><li>This came wit delicate rice and a salad with the nicest dressing we 've had in some time!</li><li>The rice was also on the dry side.</li><li>You can choose from your sashimi, maki rolls, tempura, cooked items, rice, noodles etc.</li><li>I ordered a chirashi don which is basically sashimi on rice.</li><li>And the rice has a very common taste, while the good Japanese chirashi don pays great attention to the quality of rice.</li><li>And the rice has a very common taste, while the good Japanese chirashi don pays great attention to the quality of rice.</li><li>No sashimi at lunch, but at least the amount of rice in a sushi wasnt that much.</li><li>I enjoyed the taste of this roll, but the rice makes me wonder whether I 'd ever get it again.</li><li>Again with the mushy rice.</li><li>Ironically, this rice was considerably more like sushi rice than the rice they used in their rolls.</li><li>Salmon terriyaki dinner ( $ 11.95)- two pieces of salmon terriyaki served with miso soup, salad, rice, and mixed veggies.</li><li>Soggy rice.</li><li>Maybe today was an off-day but I came here expecting to eat sushi and I was highly disappointed by the mushy warm rice which then made the nori chewy and not crunchy.</li><li>Most grocery staples available and always a large variety e.g. bread/hard bread, rice, oil ( not sure about milk, butter or cereal besides oatmeal).</li><li>The rice was n't rubbery.</li><li>I ordered 2 things: Sashimi Dinner ( $ 19.99) that includes 18 pieces sashimi, rice, soup, and salad and 2 pieces of Otoro sushi ( $ 19.99).</li><li>The bottom piece of fish plus the rice itself could have been a piece of nigiri sushi by itself probably, but somehow they chose to layer on top another piece of fish.</li><li>The fish were high quality and fresh, the rice was a good portion relative to the size of fish, and the maki were well made and delicious.</li><li>The slices of sashimi were a really generous thickness and the ones with the rice there was more fish than rice which was great.</li><li>The maki rolls arrived and were reasonably portioned without overloading the rice.</li><li>I judge sushi much by the sushi rice and this was very, very sweet rice.</li><li>The lunch boxes came with: salad ( dressing was really flavourful. captured fruity and Asian flavours), mashed potatoes with teriyaki sauce, corn, and spicy mayo, a gyoza, rice.</li><li>This is served with a side of plain rice but the chicken is delicious enough to eat on its own!</li><li>The shushi portion on the rice was paper thin, and my seaweed salad had hair in it !!!</li><li>Although the portions do n't seem large, the amount of protein and carbs you get from the healthy serving of rice and meat, fills you up a lot faster than you originally think.</li><li>The business motto of the owner is great, they cook a large quantity of rice and meat in the morning.</li><li>The jerk is perfectly marinated, the rice is flavourful, and the sauce is plentiful.</li><li>I 've had their schwarma and kabab time special which comes with a assortment of meats and rice and salad and bread.</li><li>Overall though the rice and the entree were on the savoury side.</li><li>All the food served with rice and veggies except pho of cuz.</li><li>The rice itself was not dry enough ( as in not enough wok heat).</li><li>I will ( hopefully) never get rice from here ever again.</li><li>She got a new set of utensils and broke the chicken into pieces, and mixed it with the soup, rice and noodles.</li><li>The chicken was tender, with rice in the middle.</li><li>A lot of choices for bibimbap &amp; ginseng chicken soup ( with a small bowl of noodle) The pork cutlet on rice is surprisingly good, highly recommended The plaza has a lot of parking Service is friendly The overall dinner is very entertaining Will definitely come back and try their seafood pancake.</li><li>All of the main dishes come in a hot stone bowl and the rice is super crispy in my bibimbap!</li><li>I really like the idea of the rice inside the chicken, very flavourful and moist.</li><li>Order the blood sausage soup, it came with rice.</li><li>At the bottom of the rice was a full layer of oil.</li><li>Inside the chicken is some stuffing consisting of rice, a date, and a small piece of ginseng.</li><li>The servers are so kind.^^ We ordered the ginseng chicken soup, the spicy pork hot stone bowl and the beef bulgolgi hot stone bowl which came with soup and rice.</li><li>The chicken itself was stuffed with rice, dates, and ginseng.</li><li>I 've never experienced this, but although the stone pot for my bibimbap was hot, the rice did my even stick to the pot to create that slight crust of rice this dish is known for.</li><li>I 've never experienced this, but although the stone pot for my bibimbap was hot, the rice did my even stick to the pot to create that slight crust of rice this dish is known for.</li><li>Very flavourful, perfect with plain rice.</li><li>I 'd recommend trying everything with plain rice, to get the true flavour, uncomplicated by the seasoning in the noodles.</li><li>The quality is good and the rice is fresh and tasty.</li><li>Ordered: Gae-Jang ( marinated raw crab) 2/5* Plate of marinated crab for $ 12.99* You can order soy sauce based or spicy sauce based* I ordered soy sauce based Gae Jang* Basically you get 2 small crabs all cracked up* Soy sauce marinade was decent but a little too sweet* What turned me off from this is how the crabs did n't taste very fresh* Although it is marinated, because you are eating this raw- freshness is quite important* My mouth felt a little dry/tough after eating this and it was n't very pleasant* The claw part was n't cracked and there was no way I could break it with my teeth* I was quite disappointed with this dish since I was looking forward to it Ordered: CheolPan JjooGgooMi ( baby squid stir fry) 5/5* Baby squid stir fried with vegetables and ricecake for two people at $ 19.99* This was recommended by my friend who 's had it before* It 's meant for 2 people and cooked at your table* This is very spicy ( be aware !!)* It came with lots of baby squid, ricecakes and vegetables* Sauce was very intense in flavor ( spices) and it was good to eat with rice* I thought it was kind of odd how they had broccoli in it* I loved this dish and would go back just for it Complimentary: Kong Bi Ji* This is a grinded up bean paste that people like to eat with the rice* I am not a big fan of beans .... or grinded up beans so I did n't really enjoy it* But my friend said it was really good!</li><li>The taste was a little bit to salty, it is great if you have it with rice.</li><li>Gen was a big fan of the special soy sauce blend and taught us to eat it by taking some of the rice and putting it into the shell of the crab in order to use up the soy sauce blend.</li><li>The rice really went well with the soy sauce blend as well.</li><li>The crabs were quite salty, I recommend eating it alongside rice.</li><li>With the sauce, I finished all my rice ( I usually do n't eat rice).</li><li>The menu said the carne asada just came with rice and salad but I was pleasantly surprised to find beans, tortilla and plantains with the meal.</li><li>The guys behind the counter here are pretty generous with the amount of rice, vegetables ( e.g. lettuce, pickel, onions, beets), and chicken they pile on your plate.</li><li>The two stars are for him:) The shawarma was not seasoned well and the rice was horribly waterlogged.</li><li>There was just the right amount of sauce so the rice was n't soaked.</li><li>I thought service was ok. disgusting. absolute shit. it taste horrible and the amount of rice they put on sushi to make you full faster ... and how thin their sashimi is ... oh did i mention that its overpriced ? the waitress is an asshole with attitude ... the manager is an asshole with attitude. horrible service. you have to pay extra for parking as well ... they wont validate it for more than an hour even though they take forever to make their food. i swear they do that on purpose ... fucking ridiculous.</li><li>Anyway, the AYCE menu is amazing because, surprisingly, they have GOOD sushi with very little rice and a lot of stuff.</li><li>Red Thai Curry is tasteless, too spicy, and entirely bland with mushy rice and dried up, fried, spongy tofu.</li><li>I got chicken thighs on potato, rice and possibly banana ?</li><li>It was dry and the rice did not have much flavor.</li><li>Their `` Special'' Fried Rice arrives in a Styrofoam container, ( that was squished the last time), but still full to busting with what appeared to be pieces of everything imaginable from the kitchen mixed with the rice.</li><li>I ordered the 12-piece Sashimi lunch special for an incredible $ 10.99; it came with a side of rice, noodles, two dumplings and the usual miso soup and salad.</li><li>I did try their rice and vermicelli dishes and that 's where the differences become more apparent.</li><li>The few times I had rice the pork chop was kinda burnt.</li><li>It was not bad: the chicken was moist and tasty ( even better with the gingery dipping sauce) and the rice could have been more flavorful but ok.</li><li>The dish consisted of a bowl of skin on, bone in chicken thighs with potatoes in a curry sauce and a plate of rice.</li><li>The rice takes a tad longer but I mean, still relatively fast compared to other non-pho restaurants.</li><li>I 've also tried some of the rice and meat dishes, equally good and present a great value.</li><li>The rice is so fluffy and delicious, I 've never had rice like this before.</li><li>I always happen to order of filet de pescado ( fish fillet) that comes with a side of rice, salad, and sliced plantain chips.</li><li>Not a fan of the noodles or the rice but the veggies and plantation bananas are all right I guess ( I 'm a carnivore to the core so if it is n't meat it 's a distraction anyway).</li><li>While we were paying, I asked my girlfriend if this would be enough food for us since we were sharing, the lady overheard and offered to give us a little more rice.</li><li>It had chicken, rice, two types of potatoes, salad, tzatziki, and pita.</li><li>The rice was n't any different than what you 'd get at `` real'' Greek restaurants.</li><li>I wish they 'd left it on the skewers, it 's more fun to eat it that way, but it was skewer-less and thrown on top of the rice.</li><li>I came here for dinner because I saw the awesome reviews, but after ordering their oyako-don, I was pretty disappointed- the flavour was subpar and the rice itself was non-traditional.</li><li>I order their veggie bento box, which comes with tempera, rice, salad, soup, a roll and a side dish ( different ones, depends on the day).</li><li>The portions were more than generous, and the rolls had a great rice to filling ratio.</li><li>Im used to those AYCE places where they stuff a mere slice into the handroll which is difficult to finish since 90% of it is rice.</li><li>They put a sweet sauce on the rice too kinda like the sauce on the eel).</li><li>The food was great, I was full afterwards and I did n't feel like there was too much rice which seems to be a common issue with most sushi places.</li><li>The quality has gone down because their dishes are more watered down now and they giving miserly portions of vegetables/chicken with lots and lots of rice.</li><li>And their rice has a hint of flavour.</li><li>Loved the potatoes and rice, very unique.</li><li>It is served on an oval platter and includes half rice, half meat, a few potato wedges, onions, pickled peppers, white sauce and hot sauce.</li><li>The garlic potatoes are fantastic and you ca n't fault the chicken nor the rice.</li><li>One of my favorite sides is the potatoes and the hummus. really a hole in the wall! love their potato and rice besides the main dish.</li><li>I decided to give this place a try one evening and ordered a full portion lamb shish kebab, which came with rice, potatoes and salad, and I was floored by how amazing it was!</li><li>The soft and fluffy seasoned rice was the best I 've had in a Mediterranean restaurant, surpassing most of the more elegant restaurants.</li><li>It comes with fried potatoes ( frikken awesome, very crunchy); meat is well seasoned, charcoally flavor; and rice, the absolute best.</li><li>They have pickled onions and a few jalapeno on the rice, which definitely adds to the whole date. there are two sizes, small, which comes with one skewer ( ~ 9.99 or so), and reg that comes with two ( 13.99).</li><li>My only one unpleasant experience is when a lady served us the shawarma plate and she forgot to top the rice with some onions and garlic sauce, ( place was not busy, only one person dining in and one takeout customer) so I had to walk back from the car in the rain to kindly request for the toppings that add a gazillion notch to this dish, which she gladly did.</li><li>The rice is out of this world !!!</li><li>The GF ordered the Lamb Shish Kebab small dinner which comes with salad, rice, and potatoes as well.</li><li>Seasoned rice definitely makes it taste better than white rice.</li><li>The salad is fresh and the rice is yummy!</li><li>But you definitely should go here for the Sh awarma plate because it is so delicious and huge! popped in here during lunch, and of course it 's because I was craving my New York style chicken on the rocks. the portion was huge but it was n't satisfying. the rice was over cooked but the chicken was good- I was looking for that perfect garlic sauce but it was n't enough in the meal.</li><li>It is similar to their rice but waaaaaaaaaaaaay better!</li><li>The rice was nice and fluffy.</li><li>Also got a biyrani rice which was delicious the rice had great texture and it was a large portion.</li><li>Their rice is deliciously fluffy too.</li><li>I actually ordered a Bagali polo which was described as vegetable rice and meat but the waitress anoyingly came back to say it is sold out two minutes after recommending it!</li><li>Te rice was delicious and the tomato was well grilled.</li><li>I just do n't understand how the patrons are not all fat after all the bread, butter, rice, kabob, baklava and so forth.</li><li>The rice was light and fluffy, but lacked flavour ( which might just be stye).</li><li>And the rice is airy and slightly buttered.</li><li>They came with a huge pile of delicious rice.</li><li>The order is a decent size for the price and the rice is very well spiced as well.</li><li>The salad, potatoes, and rice were average, but the meat was very unappetizing.</li><li>Chicken is tender and juicy well mix with the rice and egg.</li><li>Everything tasted average, The rolls are big, very little rice, almost too much ingredients inside and I 'm not sure all the flavours worked together.</li><li>Had: Shrimp tempura lunch set ( $ 8.95)- Comes with 3 pieces of shrimp tempura, 4 pieces of veggie, rice, soup, salad, and three veggie sides ( today 's were sesame oil broccoli, black peppered bean sprouts, and shredded potato with mayo.</li><li>The rice is fresh and moist with the correct flavouring combination of sugar and wine.</li><li>The fish was fresh and there 's a good ratio of salmon to rice ( i.e. not too much rice).</li><li>Besides the usual sashimi slices of salmon, tuna, and tai, there were also warm saucy unagi slices and mini nigiri of spicy tuna mixed with crunchy tempura bits all laid out scrumptiously on a bed of sweet and vinegary warm rice.</li><li>We got ox tail and jerk chicken and found many slithers of styrofoam in the rice.</li><li>The chicken was not too spicy and super moist, while the rice and peas had great flavour, and OMG the home made coleslaw!</li><li>If you 're ready to dive full in, what I love is the Jerk Chicken with coleslaw on a bed of rice.</li><li>Make sure you get gravy on the rice or the rice will taste a little bland in comparison to the chicken.</li><li>Make sure you get gravy on the rice or the rice will taste a little bland in comparison to the chicken.</li><li>Chicken that is tasteless and chewy and `` cartilage'', mushy salty rice and Kebbeh that is drenched in oil that when you pick it up oil just drips from it is NOT appetizing.</li><li>And that 's exactly what I got, the meat and the rice!</li><li>The rice was quite bland and the salad wilted.</li><li>You also get rice and soup for free if you go that route.</li><li>The salsa was n't well seasoned, the refried beans has no favor, nor the rice.</li><li>It tasted like some lettuce, tomatoes with flavorless rice and beans put together in a wrap.</li><li>For $ 50 including tax and a hefty tip, my boyfriend and I enjoyed on a Saturday night Sinagong ( tamarind) soup with prawns medium, Pancit Sampaguita medium, Lechon Kwahili medium ( fried pork), and Sampaguita dinner for two which included rice, lumpia ( spring rolls), deep fried chicken wings, and mixed grilled pork and chicken.</li><li>Choose from the classic Pho, rice, vermicelli, soup, appetizers and beverages including the yummy fruit shakes.</li><li>The meat they give you is barely anything and the rice is dry and tastes old.</li><li>Bento boxes, fried rice, ramen/udon, and rolls ... like over 168 items or something.</li><li>The food &amp; selection ( 4.5/5): Sashimi was fresh, the cooked meat was alright, but the rolls were definitely well done in terms of flavour and rice vs. Fish ratio: P A couple things of reasons why I thought this place differed from many other AYCE.</li><li>My dislikes- all sushi rolls, the rice was too sticky sometmes gooey, too much vinegar, the rolls with crunchy bits had tons uncooked PANKO which tasted nasty- youre suppose to cook your tempura bits and if you use PANKO please fry it with butter first, panko straight from the box is just bread crumbs.</li><li>They do n't stack the sushi on a huge pile of rice.</li><li>Able to.maintain the food quality, very attended staff, friendly, service in good standard, sashimi is always fresh, sushi rolls has the right portion of rice, weekends they serve scallop sashimi, spicy tuna hand roll, variety of good quality sashimi choices. reasonable priced and dessert is average.</li><li>GOOD ratio of fish: rice, not packed like most places.</li><li>THey were n't huge or overstuffed with rice, which made it mad easy to eat.</li><li>It 's so nice to have just sashimi instead of sushi ( with rice).</li><li>The rice for the sushi was mushy, and the white tuna sashimi was not so white.</li><li>Nigiri had too much rice while fish was proportionally very small.</li><li>When a sushi connoisseur says that it 's all in the rice, then please believe it !!</li><li>The rice lacked flavour and I had to rely heavily on the soy sauce.</li><li>Beef tataki sashimi, herb tuna sashimi or something like that, maguro hand roll .. actually hand roll because there 's too much rice, scallop sashimi- ordered ONE and it came out as a small plate unlike how the rest of the sashimi is served.</li><li>Loved the Eel Fried Rice even though there 's not much eel meat in the rice.</li><li>Maki were AAAMAZING- so little rice and they themselves were so small, very happy about that cuz I could try a bunch of different ones:) I recommend ordering the 4 piece special rolls under the dinner menu, they 're all fancy and pretty and I guarantee you will not be disappointed!</li><li>Rice was warm- this is a huge let down for me when it comes to sushi places, but it was SO busy I can see why it would happen.</li><li>If your alone they have a lunch menu ( $ 10) that includes rice and meat entree with a little steamed bok choy.</li><li>Even though the dish was found under the soup category, it is saucy enough to have with rice.</li><li>I also love ordering their rice and beef ribs dish, and crispy chicken with rice.</li><li>You have a choice of fries or rice.</li><li>I bought regular chicken on the rocks the guy just put one spoon of rice and chicken.</li><li>I ordered the Lemongrass chicken and pork chop with rice.</li><li>Their rice was relatively dry, but the pork chop was well-seasoned.</li><li>The rice was not warm, and the veggies were hard, not cooked but flashed to heat.</li><li>Dragon roll is very dissapointing, 9 $ for tiny roll only consisting of rice, tempura shrimp, green onion, nori, fish roe.</li><li>This evening my husband ordered the Salmon Teriyaki bento box which came with 6 California rolls, yaki mandu as well as your typical soup, salad and rice.</li><li>I had some of Grandpa 's rolls, and the rice was a tad too soft).</li><li>It comes with well the spicy chicken, rice, green beans ( best beans I 've ever eaten) and tofu.</li><li>Crispy Chicken on Rice ( $ 5.99) Whenever you order `` something on rice'', you 'll always get fried tofu and stir-fry green beans on the side ( and they 're delicious!).</li><li>Souvlaki, pita, salad, rice and the yummiest potatoes !!!!</li><li>The chicken was absolutely delicious, nice and spicy and the rice and peas were great with the gravy.</li><li>Some of the staples are the congee, the noodles and rice and usually a side order.</li><li>We had the deep fried tentacles, some kind of rice with mushrooms, chicken and bok choi ( one of those green things that people steam ?) and it came in a hot bowl so that the rice at the botton was sticky and crunchy at the same time: D Also had the vermicelli that 's part of the special, congee with surf clam, choy sum with oyster sauce, hot and sour soup, my friend has the cheung fun and rice roll with duck in it, and rice cake with cabbage and some pork.</li><li>We were truly delighted with the authentic taste of the soup and rice.</li><li>If I say it 's not spicy ... it 's really not spicy* I did n't like the mozarella cheese, it had weird texture and it took away the spiciness of the dish* Instant noodles were good after it soaked up all the sauce* When you are 80% done, ask for your rice to be cooked and they will do it for you* I love the crispy bottom part of the rice Summary: I would go back to Joons, but would order things differently.</li><li>If I say it 's not spicy ... it 's really not

were smaller than usually, u have to add cheese, ramen and rice cake, do n't bother getting the rice add ones We waited 30mins for our food to come and they would n't give us our side dishes until our meal came ......</li><li>While the ambiance and service of the restaurant are average at best, I always return to eat their baked pork cutlet on rice ( joo pah fan).</li><li>Besides the pork cutlet on rice, the shrimp and potato salad is also my mom 's favorite.</li><li>The rice ( com tam) is hard and dry.</li><li>The rice was flavorful and had tons of large juicy shrimp and tender chicken.</li><li>The Shrimp with lobster sauce was very dark ( looked liked they seasoned it with soy sauce), not authentic but tasty with lots of sauce to pour over the rice.</li><li>I ordered the red curry lunch special for only $ 6.95- it comes with a salad and rice.</li><li>The chicken skewers were like shoe leather, the rice was overly salted and Falafel was god awful ( cold and hard).</li><li>On the rolls we ordered, the rice was undercooked and the avocado in the rolls ranged from barely ripened to completely raw and crunchy-chewy.</li><li>Chewy, this happened to be the word that came to mind the most while eating, be it the chewy rice the chewy avocado, the chewy mayo crab or even the chewy eel.</li><li>With a wealth of other sushi offerings on Yonge street it might be well advised to make a detour elsewhere. alway busy, like ram-crammed. the service tends to be a bit harried, but always friendly. the hae-dup bap is good here, if not typical. except they have two options: japanese-style or korean-style. js is chunks of fish and ks is slivers. personally, i prefer the ks, because the fish gets incorporated into the salad and rice so each mouthful is balanced. nothing to scream about- positively or negatively. just a good option. oh, the lighting is glaringly bright. do n't bring an ugly date.</li><li>It came with a miso soup, edamame, and the bento box ( rice, salad, chicken, tofu, japchae). everything was average; the sauce on the chicken teriyaki was overpowering.</li><li>Perfect mix of sashimi, rice and some interesting little sides.</li><li>Their sushi pizza is good as well ( excellent presentation wise), but could be improved if the rice was a little more fried and if it had green onion, caviar, and tobiko on it.</li><li>The sticky rice was a little too sticky for me as I had to use a knife to literally cut through it ( my plastic fork broke trying to unstick the rice enough so that I did n't put the entire bowl of rice in my mouth at once).</li><li>The rice comes on a plate, not in a bowl, on a plate and the small was enough for sharing between 3 people.</li><li>Does n't matter if it 's with naan or with rice, I will eat that stuff up QUICK.</li><li>Usually about 3-4 Vegetarian options in the buffet ( that is besides the deserts, rice, naan and all the other stuff that goes along with most indian food.)</li><li>The rice on which it is served would be great too, if it were just a bit warmer.</li><li>I got too many vegetables and not enough rice.</li><li>We got fish &amp; tofu, chicken and broccoli, and rice.</li><li>I settled on a beef stew, it came with rice and a drink.</li><li>Ended up getting both the koobideh kebab and rice, and the lamb shank and rice to go.</li><li>Ended up getting both the koobideh kebab and rice, and the lamb shank and rice to go.</li><li>Served with a charred tomato over rice ( either dill rice or plain rice).</li><li>The blackened salmon was also enjoyable and was accompanied by standard steamed veg and rice.</li><li>But later because the food is to salty we order 1 more rice, then she laughed a bit and said `` I told you it is not enough''.</li><li>Of course, it comes with rice.</li><li>After we had eaten our fill, we had at least a third of our samgyupsal left, half a bowl of rice and all of our soup ( we did n't even touch the soup because we had too much food).</li><li>Came here for the first time and ordered jerk chicken w/ rice and peas and a roti skin w/ gravy ..</li><li>Was n't a big fan of the jerk chicken ( actually it was pretty bad) and ended up throwing out the rice and peas ( was n't my cup of tea) but the roti was delicious.</li><li>I always get beef kebab with tomatoes, rice, and the bottom of the pan.</li><li>In addition to being a market, they have a lunch counter that serves fresh kebabs, rice, and other options.</li><li>The vegetables came steamed on the side with an extra bowl of rice.</li><li>Could n't really taste the peanut sauce Golden curry with tofu $ 14- came with 6 pieces of tofu, a handful of veggies, very little sauce, and a side of rice.</li><li>The rice was so sour, it was like sucking on a lemon.</li><li>Soon after, the good food flood gates flung open and we were served the beef pannang, fried duck, rice, and noodles.</li><li>The fried rice lacked the forceful flavours of the other dishes, and the rice itself was a bit dry.</li><li>I love how we do n't have to ask for more rice.</li><li>The duck red curry serviced with rice ( $ 21) is such an incredible dish.</li><li>The rice was even worse.</li><li>Some of the dishes we ordered came with a bowl of rice.</li><li>Honestly, I liked the plain rice they gave me better than the fried rice in the coconut.</li><li>I tried the Penang chicken curry- a red curry spicy sauce topped with grilled chicken, it came with rice.</li><li>I thought the rice could be a bit sweeter, but it was balanced out by the mango- not bad! 2) Mango Roll with Ice Cream: DEELISHUS.</li><li>The rice was hard and the mango was n't fresh.</li><li>Panang curry with crispy beef- while the curry was creamy and went well with the rice, the beef was lacking any texture and again the breading was too thick.</li><li>I had a huge bowl of curry sauce and a tiny side bowl of rice.</li><li>Ended up just eating rice and peas with gravy.</li><li>I love the rice and peas that sit underneath the pork, and its topped with some cabbage and carrot slaw.</li><li>A few reasons to love Mr. Jerk- great flavor- great prices ( chicken and pork combo for 10 $ that 's good enough for 2 people)- great sides ( plantains, coleslaw, and chili all mesh well together)- large servings- gravy and rice are awesome I always order take-out and the worst part of the experience is the drive home hungry while the aroma of the grilled chicken fills the car.</li><li>The menu offers up jerk chicken and jerk pork with some additional items like goat, patties, and rice.</li><li>Overall the rice, noodle, dumpling, and bread-like dishes are very much Chinese style, but it does differ a little from mainstream Chinese cooking just to have its own unique taste.</li><li>Skewers ( most of the things on their BBQ menu)- Really flavourful and goes great with rice!</li><li>Although the usual noodles, rice costs as much as other ball places, the meat dishes are a pretty penny.</li><li>The chicken teriyaki came only with A LOT of been sprouts no other vegetables as it claims to come with along with miso soup which was just ok and even the rice wasnt great.</li><li>The rice was great ( kudos for the lack of frozen peas and carrots).</li><li>The rice and peas are excellent as well as the curries and roti.</li><li>The salad is tasty, the rice is great, and the portion is plenty filling.</li><li>It 's not the traditional `` thick'' tahina you may get some places ( it 's more of a watered-down liquid, in a squeeze bottle) but it 's still very tasty and in unlimited supply -- a group of 6 of us go through SEVERAL bottles of it when we 're there, putting it on everything -- the appetizers, the meat, the rice, everything.</li><li>The rice and and salad that came with it were excellent as well.</li><li>Even something as simple as the rice was full of flavour.</li><li>If in your plate, the beef, the rice and the salad is not good then I really do n't know what to rate this place as.</li><li>For main I ordered a chicken kebob with tabule instead of rice, my friend had the chicken shawarma plate with rice.</li><li>The rice and salad are very good as well.</li><li>It came with salad and rice.</li><li>Their rice is just plain white rice, which they ask if you want soy sauce on and their garlic bread is just really mediocre.</li><li>Salad, side rice, potato are all very bland.</li><li>Good but extremely forgettable The rice was a joke.</li><li>They are one of the few that serves broken rice which is fairly authentic.</li><li>The curry was incredibly delicious with the rice.</li><li>The rice is nicely cooked and it does the job.</li><li>Good serving of rice and a very generous portion of oxtail stew.</li><li>The rice had a nice spice profile to bring out the flavor.</li><li>The rice was cooked with too much water so it was very water logged and was n't able to absorb the curry very well.</li><li>The dishes are really standard vegetable, rice, noodles, and congee with a different spin so avoid ordering two similar dishes or you may find them tasting similar.</li><li>Try the fish and rice.</li><li>The servings included a bowl of rice plus all the usual condiments you would expect from a Korean restaurant, including the fried Korean pancakes.</li><li>The one potato was under cooked, hard as F and the rice was dry.</li><li>That, and the rice was extremely greasy.</li><li>With side dishes and rice rounding out the meal, we were very satisfied; the portions were generous but not overly so.</li><li>We shared pork wonton and I got pork bone with clear broth soup and rice.</li><li>You have to pay $ 2.00 extra for each topping you want added ( ie. rice cake, mozzarella cheese, rice, noodles).</li><li>I ordered pork bone soup and 10 mins later I was told they ran out of rice and no substitute allowed.</li><li>The Manager said wait 20mins and the rice will be ready ...</li><li>My coworker had some kind of dish served in a round kettle where everything was separated: rice, meat, vegetables, etc but then you are supposed to mix it all together.</li><li>We added noodles, cheese and rice cakes and it was yummy:) The spice is perfect, enough to clear your sinuses, but not sweat profusely from the heat: p The downside I can think of is that service is a bit slow and the add ons ( rice cakes, noodles, cheese, rice etc) are extra.</li><li>The portion got even smaller and 3 portions with noodles, rice cakes, and rice were barely filling.</li><li>You 'll probably need to top it off with some extras like rice cake, ramen, or rice.</li><li>My only disappointment was that they would n't mix the rice in with the chicken, the way it 's supposed to be!</li><li>The lady will bring the rice and sauce and cook it in front of us.</li><li>If you get rice with the dish, do n't eat everything right away.</li><li>As soon as I saw the pan ( before they put the rice in), I knew this was going to be sad.</li><li>I mean, it coated what was in the pan, but unless they added more sauce ( which they probably did), there would not be enough for the rice.</li><li>The rice was NOT worth it.</li><li>The JS1 is just normal dak gal bee with chicken and vegetable where you can add on the rice cakes, cheese, noodles, sweet potato, vegetable, steamed rice and fried rice for $ 1- $ 2 each.</li><li>Now that they got their customers LOCKED, they jacked up prices by a bit also the rice and salmon has changed to a lower quality, also the owner is very rude never says anything just walks around and bumps people on shoulders with no apologies.</li><li>The seasoning of the rice is perfect and it still has a bit of warmth ( not warm warm but not cold and brittle) to contrast the cold fish.</li><li>Dynamite Roll is huge since it is stuffed with rice and rolled up in chucks of tenkasu.</li><li>Too much vinegar in the rice but the price is very competitive.</li><li>Both rolls had a good ratio of rice to ingredients- which is a bonus for me because I hate when restaurants add so much rice and you can barely taste what is inside the roll!</li><li>The dynamite roll was hugeee and so delicious since it was filled with fresh avocado, crispy tempura and what was so unique was the crispy bits and sesame seeds sprinkled on the rice outside!</li><li>With a lot of stuffing and very little rice, lots of carrots and avocado.</li><li>Unlike some other reviewers unlucky experience, my rolls were NOT stuffed with rice.</li><li>It was actually so little rice in the dynamite and the spider rolls that i had to figure out a way to pick them up without the stuffing falling out.</li><li>And the rice was a little weird ... a little on the grocery-store-sushi side, kinda of sweet and a little harder than i would like.</li><li>Their rice is amazing, fish fresh, their fish: rice is as it should be and their service is so abrupt and rude that is it somewhat amusing and makes for good lunch time conversation if you are stuck for discussion topics with your companion.</li><li>Their rice is amazing, fish fresh, their fish: rice is as it should be and their service is so abrupt and rude that is it somewhat amusing and makes for good lunch time conversation if you are stuck for discussion topics with your companion.</li><li>Taste, lots of rice.</li><li>The rice proportion is perfect.</li><li>I mean at least the rice was hot and nice.</li><li>Dumplings are great too and so are all the various rice and noodle dishes.</li><li>I still like their food, till last Friday, the rice I got looks like left over rice from the morning.</li><li>It 's a meal for two with lots of meat, lettuce, soon tofu soup, and rice.</li><li>Pork Belly BBQ ~ That 's the only type of BBQ that you can enjoy indoor year round in Canada, this is cook at the table. ~ It usually comes with lettuce, bean sauce, raw garlic slices and rice which you could make your own lettuce wrap with. ~ You 'll hear a lot of people going ewww when they hear raw garlic slices but trust me, it taste perfect with the meat and sauce here.</li><li>Jook Sam Kyup Sal ~ squid spicy sauce with veggies, pork &amp; rice cake ~ Another type of table cooking, I love to munch on every thing here and rice is added at the end to make fried rice with the leftovers in the pot.</li><li>Verdict: ~ Everything is as good as always, there 's a reason I have been coming back for years. ~ My faves are the Pork Belly BBQ, the Kang Poon Kee ( Spicy Fried Chicken) &amp; Jook Sam Kyup Sal, especially with the added rice at the end. ~ Ca n't wait to come back for patio season.</li><li>I felt the rice was really dry.</li><li>I asked for the soup and rice to be taken to go, and that my mackerel be served to me at the restaurant ( my brother was eating his entire meal there).</li><li>For a bit over 8 dollars, I had yummy pork cutlet, filling rice and salad, and so many banchans I could n't even finish.</li><li>The raita that came with it was very watered down, too much so, so the point that it was like pouring water on the rice.</li><li>Third star is knocked off for the fact that my rice tasted like nothing ( not even like rice, more like paper), there were 3 pieces of chickens in my whole order and my salad was actually just chopped up onions.</li><li>I had the ground chicken kebob combo which comes with rice, salad, naan, and some sauce.</li><li>We ordered some rice and some chicken balls, The rice was fine, but the chicken balls were a bit dry.</li><li>Not a huge fan of the spice they use but it did need a touch more salt along with the rice.</li><li>The chicken is n't the only star in the meal, the rice and coleslaw provides the same amount of attention.</li><li>I was served 2 of the smallest chicken legs I 've ever seen, with 1 small scoop of rice.</li><li>The pho here is average but not fantastic and the rice ( chicken, pork chop, and egg) my boyfriend ordered was decent but his rice was sogging into congee.</li><li>We ordered- bun bo hue- special pho- beef and beef ball pho- rice- cha gio- three cafe su da The food was definitely a disappointment.</li><li>If they are going to serve good food they might as well start with good brand for their rice.</li><li>Asian love rice and I say their rice is like the cheapest one on the market.</li><li>We did n't eat the rice because of the pleasant smell.</li><li>- Chicken fried rice turned into fried rice with chicken on top COOL BUT the rice was very moist in oil.</li><li>We were even hesitant to ask for a small plate so that the rice could be shared.</li><li>The buffet ( which is not all you can eat) is pretty cheap ( around $ 6) Your food is given to you by a server- they will give you a HUGE amount of carbs- usually either plain rice or pasta- I 'm talking two or three cups of rice, and then a smaller amount of protein ( whatever they 've made that day) quality ranges from pretty mediocre to quite good, but it 's pretty much luck of the draw as to what they decided to make that day.</li><li>Chicken, veggies, rice, 6 pieces of sushi, and dessert) Overall, Ginza is cheap, yummy and close to anyone who lives far north in Toronto.</li><li>They had a very small selection but the pluses were:- very little rice in the maki- yum- dynamite rolls sooo fweeesh- coconut shrimp GET IN MY BELLY- deep fried squid, you sexy beast.- spicy salmon maki with sauce SQUISHED in between two salmons INSIDE the maki. !?!?!?- pop included in price- fast service, nice service would defo come back!</li><li>Also, the rice has a slight tartness from the sushi vinegar, which is very reassuring because normally a lot places just plop rice in a bowl and serve sashimi on top of it.</li><li>Also, the rice has a slight tartness

sets are in the $ 14-17 range and typically only come with a bowl of rice.</li><li>The perfect mix of rice and soup.</li><li>Not soup and rice.</li><li>I ordered the spicy chicken teriyaki lunch box ( lunch boxes are available from 11am-3pm) which came with meso soup, few maki rolls, rice, salad, and few pieces of fruits ( check the photo below) teriyaki chicken tasted A-OK.</li><li>The rice was a good portion, but the only sashimi that seemed fresh and not defrosted was the salmon.</li><li>The rice is very vinegary and went well with the salmon.</li><li>The sashimi was served on a bed of rice.</li><li>The fish was fresh, but by no means generous, and the rice could have been better.</li><li>The rice was too soft and the sushi not fresh.</li><li>Fortunately my friend picked this place for her birthday!:) We both ordered Chirashi sushi- an assortment of sushi on bed of rice.</li><li>It was appetizing and savoury, the sushi was fresh, the rice were cooked well.</li><li>On the other hand, the rice was cold and hard from the california rolls and the sushi.</li><li>It was no doubt old rice, probably leftover rice from last night, seeing as they opened half an hour late.</li><li>Food is okay, rice is dry, sushi is subpar.</li><li>A friend took me here for dinner and we got the sushi boat D. The sushi was good, fresh and had just the right amount of rice.</li><li>The rice is too dry and does n't have much flavour.</li><li>I usually love their food especially their chicken on the rocks but on my recent visit they gave me really dry chicken and rice.</li><li>The sushi here has always been somewhat sub-par with the rice being hard and they even cut down on the amount of sushi they give you per bento box!</li><li>The rice was quite chewy and tasted old.</li><li>It comes with beef ribs, rice, spicy salmon roll, miso soup, and green salad.</li><li>Fish was not fresh and rice was mushy.</li><li>The beef and egg were separated and sat nicely on the bed of rice.</li><li>It was a nice dish when some of the spicy sauce was mixed in; the pot crisped the rice nicely, and the veggies were fresh.</li><li>Favourite place for bibimbap their rice to veggie ratio is perfect.</li><li>After they carve out the rice, they pour water into the bowl to create a congee-like soup for you to drink/eat afterwards.</li><li>A dish comes with rice and water is added to the bowl the rice is originally served is making a congee-esque dish ( not sure what it 's called but it 's tasty!).</li><li>It comes in a stone bowl, super hot and I actually really love nurunji ( the crispy rice that forms along the bowl) so I ask them to leave it on the flame a lil longer.</li><li>Lots of veggies and their rice is speckled with some black rice so it turns it a purplish color^^ My friends who have ordered their other soup dishes all like their meal so this place gets a big thumbs up from me.</li><li>I 've never had my dish served on a wooden board before and rarely do I get purple rice.</li><li>I give them 5 stars because the server was very attentive, and took the time to explain to us how to eat the nurungji- that 's the scorched rice in the stone pot, after they have scooped out the rice for you.</li><li>The server will scoop the rice from a clay pot into a bowl, then fill the bowl with water, forming some sort of rice snack that people enjoy eating later.</li><li>The server will scoop the rice from a clay pot into a bowl, then fill the bowl with water, forming some sort of rice snack that people enjoy eating later.</li><li>By the way, if you ever wonder why the waiter pour water in the rice stone after transferring the rice in the bowl, here 's the reason: like most non-korean people, we would think that they pour the water to easily clean the stone, but in fact, you should be eating it.</li><li>Flavorful soup, silky tofu, seafood, perfectly cooked rice, freshly cracked eggs half cooked in the soup, plus the water soaking the flavor of burned rice bottom on the stone bowl, it 's a perfect combination of flavors and texture.</li><li>Flavorful soup, silky tofu, seafood, perfectly cooked rice, freshly cracked eggs half cooked in the soup, plus the water soaking the flavor of burned rice bottom on the stone bowl, it 's a perfect combination of flavors and texture.</li><li>Unique thing that sets it apart is the multii-grain purple rice rather than the traditional white rice.</li><li>I had the kimchi soon tofu which comes with a side bowl of rice.</li><li>They make a great bulgogi and I love the rice.</li><li>Great tofu, soup was a bit on the salty side but the rice helped with that.</li><li>When they bring out the rice, it comes in its own hot pot.</li><li>If you end up needing more rice, you can always eat the rice remains from there.</li><li>The waitstaff will be using it to pour into the emptied hot stone rice bowls to loosen those bottom-crisped pieces of rice.</li><li>The choice of appetizers are really tasty and the rice is delicious too, especially when dipped in the soup broth.</li><li>- Rice !! love the rice here !!</li><li>Soup, tofu, raw egg ( it cooks in the hot broth), kimchi, meat, rice and a few side dishes.</li><li>Love the stone bowl and stirring like a mad man to work that egg into the rice.</li><li>The price was very reasonable for the quantity of soup, rice, and banchan we received.</li><li>The rice was a nice complement to enjoy with the soup.</li><li>The rice that comes with the meal is purple and I love the authenticity of the overall meal.</li><li>The soup had lots of flavour and goes really well with the rice.</li><li>The pot was sizzling when the waiter brought it and the rice was purple.</li><li>A ton of rice to be honest ...</li><li>I personally would prefer the hot water not poured on the stone pot but the crispy rice kept till the end to mix with the remaining stew ( if any lol).</li><li>I love the purple rice -- do n't get freaked out when they pour water into the stone pot after they scoop the rice out, it makes for a nice watery-congee-like soup after your meal ( if you like that).</li><li>The rice is later scraped out by one of the ( good looking Korean male!) waiters so that you can later pour your extra soup into this bowl to flavour the rice still stuck on the side of stone bowl.</li><li>The rice was cooked in a korean stone pot which made the flavor exceptional.</li><li>I did n't know I was supposed to crack one of those eggs into the bowl of soup, so I sat there, waiting for the rice.</li><li>What surprised me was the hot stone pot they used to serve the rice.</li><li>This left us with crispy rice at the end!</li><li>The rice was also cold, and questionably pale for so called purple rice.</li><li>They scoop the cooked rice to a bowl for you to enjoy with your tofu soup or bulgogi and pour the water in the hot stone bowl where there are still remainders of rice that 's stuck to the bottom of the hot stone bowl.</li><li>I love the rice in the stone bowl at the end, but I wish they would pour tea inside instead of water.</li><li>At comparable restaurants, they charge you $ 3.50 for this rice + the rice stuck to the pot.</li><li>BUT, they make one of the best rice I have ever had, i almost always ask for extra rice and i do n't know if the hot stone pot is the magic to it all, but the rice seems to compliment everything dish perfectly.</li><li>BUT, they make one of the best rice I have ever had, i almost

too !!</li><li>Although their rice is consistently good, their side dishes are getting worse and worse.</li><li>Oh, and I absolutely love it when the rice at the bottom turns crispy.</li><li>After all is said and done, you can have the burnt rice in hot water- congee' ish.</li><li>Tofu is gorgeously soft, they serve the rice ( purple rice) and pour the water into the stone pots for the soup for you too!</li><li>The crispy rice at the bottom gives it a crunchy texture, and the semi raw egg on top tastes great when mixed in with the rice.</li><li>The crispy rice at the bottom gives it a crunchy texture, and the semi raw egg on top tastes great when mixed in with the rice.</li><li>The bibimbap comes with gochujang ( otherwise you have to pay 50 cents extra for it), and it 's the really thick kind that you have to smear onto your rice, rather that squeeze from a bottle.</li><li>$ 8 flat after tax for the soup, rice, and 4x sidedishes ( which you can get a second round of if you 're so inclined, free of charge).</li><li>I like that they do give the water + hardened rice at the end if the meal.</li><li>Even though I 'm so full -- i still end up eating some of the extra rice as well!</li><li>For $ 9, you get pretty full from all the soup, rice, and banchai.</li><li>Food was way too salty, and I thought the purple rice hot stone bowl was a huge source of waste ( so much of the rice was stuck in the stone pot!)</li><li>I 'm not a fan of the water rice ( dessert) so this time I asked if they do n't put the water, and letting the rice sitting there during our meal, it became crispy and yummy.</li><li>They get the stone hot enough so that the rice at the bottom really crisps up nicely.</li><li>In any case, their soon tofu is presented the same way as BCD in LA with the rice served in a dol sot and then the dol sot with the leftover rice is filled with hot water to make a porridge.</li><li>Even before our sushi and maki rolls made it to our table, the maki rolls were coming apart, rice was falling off of the sushi when I picked it up by hand!</li><li>And I want to emphasize, I eat sushi with my hands because it gives me more control and holds sushi together better, but the sushi was so poorly put together, the rice was not properly made, that it fell apart as I brought to my mouth ...</li><li>Food ( Lunch): Besides the cooking table I have been for lunch service and ate the chicken-bento-box with soup, small salad, 4 sushi rolls, rice and tofu.</li><li>Ordered the pork Katsu arrived with hard pork no rice or salad.</li><li>Teppanyaki Ume ( see picture) is a very good full lunch which includes soup, salad, shrimp appetizer, rice, veggies, chicken and steak.</li><li>The meat is plain and the rice overcooked, and there 's little in the way of interesting herbs, sauces, or salsa to liven it up.</li><li>The standard burrito build is rice, your choice of re-fried or black beans, grilled veggies ( mixed peppers and onions mostly), mild or medium sauce, both tomato and corn salsas, cheese, lettuce and sour cream.</li><li>The pork was juicy and the rice had a good flavor.</li><li>And the rice can be quite oily at times.</li><li>But I 'm not 100% if it 's from the shawarma or the rice itself is oily to begin with.</li><li>So for the really healthy people, keep that in mind when ordering the shawarma or anything that comes with the rice.</li><li>As you work your way through the chicken and salad, the rice ends up being coated in a mixer spicy BBQ sauce, garlic sauce and which ever salad dressing you chose ( ranch for me!) leaving a sloppy mess of yumminess at the end.</li><li>So I ask one of the employees if he can help me, and he just goes to the back grabs a plate and just literally scoops a heap of their honey garlic chicken and dumps it on a half scoop of old rice and hands it to me ... great service.</li><li>Alongside the soup they provide a small dishes of rice and three different types of kimchi that accompany the meal, all of which were really tasty.</li><li>My boyfriend and I asked for a side of rice and soy sauce and a Budweiser.</li><li>For a group of 4, we got the family size Gamjatang ( pork bone soup, comes with 2 rice) for $ 23; 99, japchae ( glass noodles with veggies) $ 8.99 and beef kalbi ( small, $ 15.99, comes with 1 rice).</li><li>The potato chunks make the broth thicker which I enjoyed near the end with my rice.</li><li>WHAT WE ORDERED: YukGaeJang 細牛肉湯 Beef with vegetables in hot spicy soup, rice* hmmm not a fan of it this is what my boyfriend ordered I tried it I was spicy which is good but for me had a odd taste like I was tasting soup of roots like it was n't a earthy taste all I can say it was odd my boyfriend did n't really finish it so.</li><li>Everything from their drinks to their rice and noodle dishes are amazing.</li><li>Big hunks of extremely flavourful chicken, tasty rice, a pita and tzatziki sauce.</li><li>I had the spicy tofu seafood soup ( came w/ rice).</li><li>I went during lunch ( 12-1 pm) and was craving bibimbap and thought you could do no wrong with a new place ordering a simple rice and toppings dish.</li><li>My favorite is by far the pork bone soup, it spicy and goes really well with the rice that they give you and the side dishes of bean sprouts, fish curd, kimchi, and seaweed.</li><li>I 've often brought friends and suggested they order some meat katsu, bulgogi, kan poong ki ( sweet &amp; spicy chicken) or bi bim bap ( veggies, rice, beef, fried egg, &amp; spicy sauce).</li><li>The side dishes came but they also brought out our rice at the same time.</li><li>Their kalbi is expensive ( $ 15.99 for the meal with rice), but it 's cooked so well and the pieces of kalbi are well-marbled and meaty.</li><li>Delicious pork bone soup, a bit on the salty side, but easily offset by pairing it with the complimentary bowl of rice.</li><li>The chicken is perfectly grilled with lots of sauce and is accompanied by delicious roasted potatoes, salad ( I ca n't get enough of this dressing!), their amazing glass noodles, rice and miso soup.</li><li>The food is tasteless and the plate of food I had for takeout was 90% rice and not good.</li><li>`` Can I have a larger salad instead of the rice ?'' ... `` NO''.</li><li>The rice however was a bit of a mess as it smelled off.</li><li>The kebabs were sumptuously savoury and the rice was delicious!</li><li>They were all good and went well with the rice.</li><li>The meat was tender and juicy, the rice was great too.</li><li>I ordered lamb shank with dill rice and it was a very large portion -- meat was very tender and the rice was good, not too oily at all which I find is the problem with some other places I otherwise like.</li><li>The meat seemed high quality and the rice was well cooked.</li><li>The rice was cooked perfectly and the consistency of the risotto was spot on.</li><li>Over all the the portion of the rice is too much and the quality of the salmon is OK but it is very thin.</li><li>Salmon sushi pizza Salmon sushi hand roll Salmon sushi $ 38.40 Rice tasted weird Sushi had a stale after taste Drowned my salmon sushi in soya sauce and it still did n't help get rid of the awful aftertaste They charge you extra for fish eggs ( The girl kept telling me it was 5 cents extra and they charged me $ 2.50 When I spoke to the manager he said it was 50 cents extra per order) The girl taking my order could n't spell or understand English The food was awful, I usually order from Vip sushi whose prices and food taste way better.</li><li>The rice to fish balance for their rolls its quite good for an AYCE place.</li><li>Sashimi on the top of the rolls were fresh but the roll itself has too much rice which fills you up really fast.</li><li>You can tell they wanted to fill us up on rice.</li><li>The Rolls were huge, but only because there was so much rice stuffed into it! 3.</li><li>The Dynamite and Spider rolls were great, not too much rice.</li><li>Sushi had way too much rice.</li><li>Seafood is hit and miss.
