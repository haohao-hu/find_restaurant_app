<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 441' %><h2>takoyaki<br />occurrence: 10</h2><div><ol><li>I ordered myself a side of takoyaki ( again- in relation to the search of the best takoyaki).</li><li>Gosh, the takoyaki was horrible.</li><li>At about $ 8.50 each, you get soup, salad, 16 rolls, and in the winter they add 2 takoyaki, dumplings, or spring rolls.</li><li>The food I liked today includes the short ribs, sakura rose sushi, skillets, chicken kagame, calamari, takoyaki, beef and mushroom wrap.</li><li>They have authentic okonomiyaki that they make fresh and serve on a sizzling platter with all the fixings. their gyoza is fresh and cooked to perfection. their takoyaki ( round pancake balls with a piece of octopus) is authentic and fresh too. less soup base options to ajisen, but if you find the equivalent here, you should find that it is less salty, less msg. being korean run, seeing any kimchi or pickled radish actually makes sense, and i think there is kalbi ( korean beef short ribs) on the menu as well. their service is not fast, and this place can be quite busy at times, but if you want ramen and you are not downtown on dundas or queen street, this is the best ramen you can get. i can vouch for the quality and consistency of this particular location, dunno about other Kenzo locations. i miss the tempura they used to have at this location, but it was taken off the menu. if you want an authentic bowl of ramen or okonomiyaki that is the closest thing to getting to Japan and having one there, this is the place if you are uptown.</li><li>Food-wise if you 're not in a ramen mood the katsu here is excellent, and also the takoyaki was very good.</li><li>Both the meat and vegetarian gyozas are quite delicious, as are the takoyaki.</li><li>The Takoyaki is some of best in town as well.</li><li>I ca n't say the same for the other locations, but the North York location is a sure bet if you ask me. good amount of parking either at the front or back. the ramen is really good and flavorful, bowls are really big for the price you pay ( you will be full) unlike some places that charge $ 15 a bowl and you leave hungry. there 's lots of choices and i tried a few, ca n't go wrong here with the ramen. the takoyaki is way overprice tho.</li><li>Menu is old/battered and dispersed in the restaurant, unlike the other Kenzo establishments ... for example, some of the items are found on the wall ( takoyaki and a few other menu items was not listed on the menu but advertised on a piece of paper on the wall), place is also very old, small and cramped- you 're sitting on wood rather than comfortable chairs.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
