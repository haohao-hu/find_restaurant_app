<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 367' %><h2>green tea<br />occurrence: 13</h2><div><ol><li>It was ok i should say, but for sure not a place to come often.- the waiter do n't give attention at all, and do n't botter asking about the menu choices cause he wo n't give a nice answer;- green tea comes for free and it is good, but again the waiter wo n't come around to refill;- what i asked did n't look too attractive and either too tasty, but for $ 6 I guess I ca n't say much;- the owner is a nice person, not that talked much, but gave attention and asked if I liked.</li><li>I 'd wish green tea would be hotter and there would n't be a TV screen visible from no matter where you sit, but other than that, the service so far has been fast and attentive, no plastic plates or cups, the fish is very fresh, rolls are of good size and nicely presented.</li><li>First off, looking at their menu, they had a variety of Korean ginseng chicken soup like green tea ( very interesting).</li><li>I got the green tea and the sweet potato.</li><li>Pho Huong Trang makes some pretty lame cold rolls ( they did n't hit you with that refreshing feeling you generally get), there was no coriander in ANY of the dishes we ordered, and to add insult to injury, the green tea was barely lukewarm -- that 's just offside!</li><li>I do n't know how the green tea taste got in there.</li><li>Bubble tea, nai cha, is green tea based as opposed to milk based.</li><li>.5 star off for the latte &amp; .5 star off for the big ass mosquito that was swooping around me the entire time. green tea crepe kinda pricey good green tea flavour good to share.</li><li>Some of the ice-creams ( sesame, green tea, almond pistachio) are also homemade, giving it a strong prominent flavor.</li><li>Pistachio and green tea are highly recommended.</li><li>And the green tea is delicious and unlimited, so enjoy drinking a ton as you eat.</li><li>Nothing really stood out other than the multiple flavours of ice creams ( vanilla, green tea, red bean, mango, ginger).</li><li>It took an act of God to get a refill on our green tea too.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
