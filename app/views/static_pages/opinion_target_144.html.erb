i couldnt even drink the tea cause the cups had such a strong bleach scent. needless to say, we will not be returning and would not recommend it to anyone.</li><li>The prime rib burger was actually quite tender and flavorful, with the mushrooms and other topics much fresher than expected.</li><li>Bbq pork rice, Chicken soy and Toufoo with mushrooms are really good.</li><li>One that I 've had a few times is the Greek Burger ( Feta Cheese, mushrooms, &amp; onions).</li><li>We ordered the Bul Nak Jeon Gol which was hot pot with beef sausages, octopus, clear noodles, tofu, mushrooms, Korean cabbage, zucchini, watercress, hot peppers and onions.</li><li>Boo Daw Jung Gol ~ Kimchi hotpot with all the ingredients you can think of and it will varied from restaurants. ~ Here, there 's beansprout, sausage, spam, mushrooms, veggies and of course the instant noodle. ~ It 's as if you raid the fridge in the middle of the night for things to add to your instant noodle. ~ This is the ultimate dish to end a rather heavy drinking night;) Dduk Bok Gi ( Spicy Rice Cake) ~ With fish cake slices, all immerse in a thick spicy sauce. ~ Filling, yummy and cheap dish that I will never get tired of.</li><li>I love mushrooms.</li><li>I saw mushrooms and meat ( bacon) bits.</li><li>The only thing I have to say was the sauce used to smother the mushrooms were a little on the salty side and mind you, I love salty food but this was a bit more than I can handle!</li><li>There were lots of mushrooms and mozzarella cheese and spinach in the portobello mushroom crepe, and the flavors blend very well.</li><li>Like everything was soft and squishy- the crepe, the mushrooms, etc.</li><li>My partner had the beef dumpling soon tofu which was the only item he could have since he has to avoid any type of shellfish, pork or mushrooms ... probably wo n't be returning because of this ...</li><li>I ended up having a mixed omellette, and the mushrooms were not that fresh.</li><li>While the food itself was adequate ( I ordered a regular pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms and green peppers), my overall satisfaction with the restaurant was significantly negatively affected by the high levels of ambient noise.</li><li>It 's got this awesome sweet soup that is filled with sweet meat, mushrooms, some noodles, and a few greens ( leeks ?).</li><li>I recommend getting the veal with cheese and mushrooms.</li><li>They charge up to $ 2.00 eachfor additional toppings like mushrooms, peppers and cheese.</li><li>I always go for their veal sandwich with mushrooms and onions.</li><li>We got coconut soup which was floating with many uncut mushrooms and few chunks of chicken.</li><li>Each teppanyaki combination comes with a pleasant array of stir-fried vegetables ( consisting of mushrooms, onions, zucchini, and bean sprouts) and a bowl of white rice.</li><li>Usually order the Chicken Pad Thai ( noodles, tofu, chicken, a sprinkling of green onions and a pack of ground peanuts on the side), Spring Rolls ( 2, with sauce) and/or the Ginger Chicken ( stuffed with chicken and different mushrooms, a few red peppers and a flavorful sauce).</li><li>I thought you ca n't go wrong with eggplants stuffed with mushrooms and cheese.</li><li>I made an effort to try everything, though some I could n't resist sampling a few times, such as:- eggplant and tomato puree with loads of garlic- blinis with caviar- pickled cabbage, cucumbers and watermelon ( the latter being my new favourite!)- chicken kebabs- shredded chicken salad- spiced mushrooms- stuffed turkey neck- bread pastry ( almost phillo) with stuffed cheese Since the food was already laid out when we arrived, we began eating at 8pm, washing it all down with vodka and wine.</li><li>4 tiny mushrooms, 4 asparagus &amp; two tiny slices of carrot and a few green beans.</li><li>I ordered the 4-egg omelette and added mushrooms and bacon.</li><li>I like it ... actually to me it seems like a cross between Ramen and Korean Soup ... its a little spicy, and has a bunch of different ingredients ( as well as the typical stuff, it has mushrooms, bean sprouts, carrots, etc).</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
