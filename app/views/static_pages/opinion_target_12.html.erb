<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 12' %><h2>meal<br />occurrence: 548</h2><div><ol><li>Every other day, for nearly 6 years, I walked by Cuisine of India and never really paid it much attention until people who lived no where nearby started recommending it. then i began to notice that lux cars were always parked there; it 's one of the only places around this subway travellers ' strip with a parking lot in front of the restaurant. and, as far as I can tell, it 's free to park. but certainly there 's more than the parking that caused these commuters from other parts of the city to rave about Cuisine of India. driving is one thing, but in this weather, i wondered,' is it worth walking ? ' so, i rallied my girlfriends living nearby to see just why commuters from other parts of the city were flocking. we got the impression that few local residents ever visited, since the host quizically looked at us ( the group of asian girls) when we entered and waited to be seated. after establishing that, indeed, we were there to eat, yes, food from Cuisine of India, the service was attentive, patient, and warm. the a la carte portions at Cuisine of India are small, and yet incredibly rich. so you can sample a few and be full, without getting a food baby. unfortunately, i do n't remember the names of the dishes we tried, but i recall that the curried cauliflower dish was very well-spiced, without being spicy. the naan are excellent, as are the spicy cracker-like flatbreads. the latter are served while you wait for your meal and the heat really does hit after a few nibbles, so pace yourself as you wait for your meal.</li><li>Very reasonable for a massive meal.</li><li>Mt girlfriends family has made a tradition of going here every year for dinner on New Years Day ( why we keep going when one of the kids got their meal AFTER everyone else ate last year) Anyways, I tried a few things on the menu until I came across the souvlaki ( the meat, veg and rice was nothing special, but wow did I ever fall in love with the dressing on the Greek salad).</li><li>Would recommend going there for a very satisfying 15 $/ person meal!</li><li>Plenty of free apps with your meal and we always leave with enough food for another meal.</li><li>You know how you have a sense that the waitstaffs really attentive, really care about you and make sure you have a good meal ?</li><li>First off, never order a meal here.</li><li>You can get a meal and add the salad bar buffet for a small fee, or you can get the salad bar as a full meal.</li><li>I sat enjoying my meal, feigning my interest in my Smartphone while listening in, thinking about how much I missed growing up listening to my grandmother and other older aunts and uncles talked each other, while I 'd sit intently listening in on the recipes they 'd share.</li><li>I ca n't believe they do n't serve any dessert at the end of our meal which they used to have.</li><li>A balanced meal this is not, but next time I want something cheap in the neighbourhood that is n't a pizza or corned beef, I 'll check this place out again.</li><li>Following that rule this meal would have earned the waitress a whopping $ 3.50 but I found myself asking `` where the hell is our waitress'' so often that there was no tip left to leave.</li><li>Maybe people like it because it 's home style meal ?</li><li>Inside the meal was n't too piping hot, the cheese was melting though.</li><li>As Vanessa mentioned in her previous review, the salads, which to be fair most restaurants in the area add up to the meal, are grandiose.</li><li>If I were to make a list of places to go for a meal, Marky 's would be near the very bottom.</li><li>3 of their salmon sashimi = 1 salmon sashimi anywhere else. all the fish were so thin it looked like oil soaked through a piece of paper. the whole meal is smaller than the size of my fist ... and over half of it was white radish used to fill and prop up the transparent fish. after you calculate everything .. you totally lose.</li><li>With the impressively long menu ( the online menu is divided into 19 pages) you really wo n't have a problem to chose your favorite meal.</li><li>We had a delicious meal here- unfortunately the server was n't very quick to greet us and our food sat on top of the sushi bar waiting to come to us for a long long time.</li><li>Our meal came down to about $ 60 per person, before tips, and you can attribute that to having a go at the more expensive a la carte sushi as well as ordering way too much sake for two people.</li><li>Sushi Moto was a great meal, and a solid choice for Japanese in North York.</li><li>Everything tasted good and the meal was filling.</li><li>Once I did get greeted, and I ordered and the food came out pretty promptly, but near the end of my meal, I wanted to order another drink but again, it was at least 10 minutes before the server came back ( and at that point, a gentlemen they 'd seated next to me had been waiting that same 10 minutes to be greeted by a server) so I gave up and asked for the bill.</li><li>The service was on point and we had a very enjoyable meal.</li><li>Delicious meal every time.</li><li>If you want a good meal, do n't go there.</li><li>They were so kind as to give me a big whopping $ 25 after a ruined meal for three.</li><li>So I gave it to a homeless person and told them to go enjoy a good meal.</li><li>One might even call The Keg a trendsetter in that it was one of the first midrange chain restaurants in Canada, well before Moxie 's or Jack Astor 's, and in its heyday, it was more about the experience of a good meal then just going through the motions.</li><li>For the most part, the meal is nothing special now.</li><li>Not a great place for big gatherings, but perfect to share an intimate meal.</li><li>It was delicious, but was nearly a meal in and of itself.</li><li>The meal for the two of us came to about $ 58 plus tax.</li><li>There was one other couple in our room who talked our ears off through the entire meal about how awesome this place is.</li><li>Oh, and the freshly-baked bread is downright dangerous to the appetite you 'll need ... so be careful ... but if you ask for a doggie-bag ( not for your Pug or Rottweiler but for yourself) they make a little basket out of tin foil so you can take your leftover meal home.</li><li>Prices has also increased $ 1 or so per meal.</li><li>It was a very filling meal and pretty reasonably priced as I got a salad and some bread to go with it.</li><li>Looking for a quick delicious meal ?</li><li>As I sit in the restaurant at the end of a bad meal, I normally might describe it as having left a bad taste in my mouth.</li><li>This meal was the definition of bland.</li><li>The best meal on the menu, Veal Marsala, is now gone.</li><li>The homemade pita was probably the best part of our meal, the wine was great too.</li><li>Even at it 's busiest, the noise level never really reaches above a murmer, so it 's also a great place for a no fuss, quiet meal.</li><li>I think the cooks need more training and knowledge on how to cook a decent meal.</li><li>There is also a patio and a McDonald 's right across if you want a cheap meal right after these amazing drink prices!</li><li>I could n't even remotely finish my meal.</li><li>They have a menu for all price range so weather on a budget or not you can get a filling meal.</li><li>Prior to eating the soup I was feeling run down and tired but this soup actually gave me a big burst of energy, this would be a great meal for anyone who was feeling a little under the weather.</li><li>During my meal I was asked how my meal was and on two different occasions she asked if I wanted more side dishes.</li><li>During my meal I was asked how my meal was and on two different occasions she asked if I wanted more side dishes.</li><li>Enjoyed this authentic korean meal!</li><li>Including the 3 pops ordered, the meal came up to approx.</li><li>Do n't forget to ask for the chilli vinegar to accompany your meal.</li><li>Low and behold, my meal was very good, with a very short wait time as well.</li><li>The corn, with soy sauce and red chili as per Devan 's suggestion, was one of the highlights of the meal for me.</li><li>Oh one thing I did n't like during my meal, the lady at the front booth, just stands there staring.</li><li>Mid way through our meal, the restaurant was full house and it got super busy.</li><li>But today it was cold, and my boyfriends meal was a tad cold as well.</li><li>We ordered an extra meal for take out and when we got home, it was completely a different menu item.</li><li>People will finish their meal and leave their table and the staff will either: a) ignore the abandoned table that needs to be bussed for far too long or b) they 'll buss the table and let the clean empty table just sit there empty while ignoring people waiting to be sat because they prefer to seat in the order you arrive.</li><li>Let 's not get me started on the missing Tortilla, but even with it this meal can be considered good value for the price due to the amount of Food provided.</li><li>Here in town with some friends and after waiting for a crazy long time ( when there were tables open. why ?) we finally got sat and had a good meal.</li><li>It was actually an item off the Teen menu so I was a bit scared the portions were going to be tiny bit I could n't even finish my meal.</li><li>Along with the pita that they throw in as well, it is one tasty meal.</li><li>Overall, a good place to stop by and grab a late night meal!</li><li>You can either get your meal or eat family style.</li><li>When the meal was done, we stopped ordering, there was no one there to clear our plates and basically sat there for a good 30 mins getting cold and gross.</li><li>I ordered the smoked salmon eggs benedict that I was really looking forward too because I did n't want a meat heavy meal.</li><li>Had they told me this as soon as they found out, I would have gladly ordered something else- which is what I did after waiting almost 30 minutes for a meal that would probably never come.</li><li>The entire meal was satisfying, tasty and fresh.</li><li>I did n't get the feeling that my meal was sitting under a heat lamp of any sort.</li><li>That was a turn off for me as I like to sit and enjoy my meal not feel like i 'm taking too long.</li><li>There is so much flavour in that one meal.</li><li>Going to order juice next time w/ that happy meal!</li><li>Their menu has an array of choices ( from their classic chicken balls to their noodle dishes) and every meal has been delicious so far!</li><li>I ate about half of my meal and had to give up.</li><li>For us its a dependable, inexpensive meal when we are running late.</li><li>By the end of our meal, I enjoy the food at this place but that chicken just tastes awful.</li><li>Overall, I had a pleasant meal and the food is good.</li><li>Perfect treat shared amongst friends after a hearty meal.</li><li>I recommend you to go here if you 're looking for a cheap and fulfilling meal:).</li><li>By the second bite, it was no longer about casually enjoying a meal.</li><li>Honestly, it 's a great place to go and have a lovely meal.</li><li>It 's just a decent place to get a meal.</li><li>Recommended for hungry carnivores looking for a simple satisfying meal that is also cost-friendly.</li><li>Review: The service was a bit slow considering their price for a meal but the food was good.</li><li>Great atmosphere, great food, good service ( service level dropped a little bit through out our meal), and prices are not bad for what you get !!</li><li>Food quality was great, we ordered the filet mignon and New York steaks for our meal and they were cooked excellently and quite delicious.</li><li>Allows for conversation without loud music dominating, and so made for a nice intimate meal.</li><li>Cranberry was the only decent thing on that plate, but still I regretted the entire meal.</li><li>He definitely made it a memorable meal.</li><li>The meal included a choice of soup or Caesar salad.</li><li>First of all, the entire meal was cold.</li><li>We decided to go somewhere else for coffee and dessert since our meal had been so underwhelming.</li><li>Non-alcoholic beverages are also an option if you do n't want to be caught drinking before 11AM;) For those who ca n't stomach such a grandiose meal in the morning, you can always go the à la carte route.</li><li>The lobster cobb salad served on the Sunday brunch meal was devine ...</li><li>Service was very slow- the meal took two and half hours and our bus boy needed to yell at our server multiple times to get our check.</li><li>This was possibly the worst meal we have ever had.</li><li>Downside to the meal: was first time the seafood pasta was amazing.</li><li>The meal came with an alcoholic drink, bread basket, entrée, and dessert.</li><li>For $ 30 and 15% off, the multiple course meal with alcoholic drink is a pretty good deal.</li><li>All in all a nice meal.</li><li>Overall decent meal!</li><li>Came here with my bro for a post-workout meal.</li><li>When I was done with my meal and got up to pay at the counter, he pretty much forced me into a weird, drunken conversation ( I kept trying to get him to just take my money but he would n't, and would get a bit aggressive and acted insulted when I kept insisting that I needed to go home) and due to his drunken state, he got quite borderline aggressive at times.</li><li>No idea how they make anything, but it 's an incredibly filling meal ( enough for 2 people to share if you 're not starving that day)- comes with a salad, lots of rice, and deliciously baked/grilled potatoes.</li><li>Worst meal I 've had for a while.</li><li>I wanted a healthy salad and got a flavorless meal I could make better at home.</li><li>Skip this location and look for a local haunt to get a great meal.</li><li>I will never ever come to this restaurant again even if I were offered a free meal.</li><li>The meal costed $ 40 for 2 people with lots of leftovers for the next day.</li><li>The apples and oranges you get at the end of the meal are cut decoratively and are always fresh.</li><li>It comes with salad and miso soup as appetizers, and a scoop of ice cream to end the meal ( I am not sure if they offer ice cream to everyone or just a big group).</li><li>It is a fulll on meal itself!</li><li>You ge two large pieces of chicken kabob and although the meat portion is pretty large I found myself still not fully satisfied in terms of the fullness of my belly;) I got my meal to go and had to wait a little less than 10 minutes.</li><li>They forgot to get my basket of bread, I had to ask for it and they added some complimentary hummus and hot sauce ( which is the only reason this review gets two stars) No one bothered to check on us if we were having a good meal nor did anyone bother to fill our water.</li><li>The man asked us if we wanted hummus or baba ganoush and we said that we would like hummus assuming that it came with our meal.</li><li>The turnips that they gave her tasted like melted plastic ( actually melted plastic) and her meal was n't even hot either.</li><li>This place offers daily deals so it 's good on the wallet when you need a filling meal, but short on cash.</li><li>They lady gave us a York Peppermint Patty at the end of our meal which was a perfect ending.</li><li>We continued to eat the dissatisfied meal, where the lady did n't even bother to ask if we wanted a refill on our drinks, which we clearly needed since our glass was empty!</li><li>Waitress was all over the table throughout the meal- literally reaching across and handing dishes to those seated on the other side, obviously untrained.</li><li>The shop looks like nothing from the outside but the halibut with chips are simply amazing. i have n't gotten a chance to eat anything else here, since all i ever get is fish and chips. pretty heavy meal, bring an empty stomach and expect to be stuffed! if you been to Olde Yorke Fish n Chips, this is on par or better since the Olde Yorke `` waterdown'' their fish nowadays.</li><li>It 's about 14 $ for that meal, kind of pricey, but the value is there.</li><li>Sometimes, you just want a glass of vino with your burger to step it up a notch and take your McDonald-like experience to a whole new level. great burgerBUT messed up my order even tho the large foot tall number token was very obvious. had to leav- left beer- king east location- rap music and noise level was so loud I was shocked no one complained. fries and burger tasty hate that the service was non apparent must line up to order- no table ordering food no condiments on table or napkins even! pros- meal `` deal''. came to 14 $ for small jr burger a fry and a beer. not sure that 's a deal.</li><li>You come here to have a good meal and leave.</li><li>At least you can use their sauce to make things taste better .. here you have nothing to help you save your meal.</li><li>Came to Tutto Pronto with my family as it has become a tradition ever since my sister and I got full-time jobs to treat my parents out to a nice meal.</li><li>Everybody enjoyed their meal and my dad was still talking about it when he got home.</li><li>Our meal started off with a couple glasses of wine, obviously, and a few appetizers.</li><li>My meal of Penna alla Pollo was terrific!</li><li>The first time I walked in I think I was the only non-Filipino there, and the staff welcomed me and immediately gave me a crash course in Filipino cuisine- the meal was incredible.</li><li>We did n't order much because we were about to head to a Yelp event with food but the three dishes ended up being plenty as an entire meal for 5ppl!</li><li>I wish we had ordered veggies to balance the meal.</li><li>While the food was very fresh and tasty, the lack of sauce made the meal a tad dry.</li><li>This is my go-to spot on campus to grab a healthy, wholesome meal.</li><li>The sandwiches are so big, half of one is a meal in itself!</li><li>Pho is excellent for hang overs and a great meal when your sick.</li><li>For example, the plate of bean sprouts, lime and other herbs that accompany your meal are fresh and generous.</li><li>Eat a lot of pho with my buddies and this place was the recommended spot if wiling to make the drive ( close to my fiancée 's house) I love the thicker noodles as compared to other places and even though my well done beef is NEVER well done I still love this place because that seems to be the norm I usually get well done beef with beef balls and always enjoy the meal despite the mountain of fat that ends up beside my bowl A place to try if you have not already.</li><li>Better than grabbing a fast food chain meal Definitely a repeat place especially when craving something to warm the tummy at 10pm.</li><li>That 's how I felt after having my meal.</li><li>And overall a very satisfied meal!</li><li>Halfway through our meal we saw something move on the table and we realized that it was a cockroach.</li><li>Highlights of the meal: Sexy summer roll- Very light and refreshing with a bit of a kick.</li><li>My boyfriend tried to compliment the service when he paid for our meal but she did n't seem to understand.</li><li>Service was subpar with regards to ordering our meal.</li><li>My meal and my friend 's meal each cost $ 7.25.</li><li>We had no internet access to preview our meal.</li><li>The entire meal was fantastic, from the olives and fish pate opener to the main course closer.</li><li>None of us had visited here before, but it looked like a promising option for a good meal.</li><li>You have an option of 1 bottle of Soju, or 5 bottles of beer, along with your meal.</li><li>It was a very fullfilling meal.</li><li>This place has it and it comes out scorching hot, by the end of my meal it was still warm to the touch.</li><li>Be sure to try Hite, a Korean beer, with your meal.</li><li>I sincerely suggest anyone who 's searching for a comfy place for an enjoyable meal to avoid this.</li><li>At no point did the servers ever come to ask how our meal was, to refill our water, to refill our bread or simply to check in.</li><li>Apart from the Mariscos al Guajillo ( tiger shrimp, basa fish and Atlantic lobster sauteed with onions, guajillo peppers and salsa verde for $ 22) which was EXCELLENT, the rest of the meal was just ok.</li><li>It is easy to create a balanced, filling meal that is not too unhealthy.</li><li>I stopped eating it for fear of swallowing more bones, and did not finish my meal.</li><li>Table-top cooked dishes are quite common in Korea, they are usually very cheap and easy to find in small neighbourhoods and people usually enjoy them as a meal or to eat with soju.</li><li>Had a very nice meal here.</li><li>The meal special comes with a tomato soup or cream soup and a dinner roll, also coffee or tea.</li><li>Not sure if they 've changed kitchen staff over the years ( since it 's the same owners, I did recognize one of the ladies who took customers ' orders), but the meal was just pretty disappointing.</li><li>If you order from the regular menu and want to have a milk tea with your meal like I do, you 're looking at upwards of $ 15 or more per person which is pretty high for HK style cafes.</li><li>I ordered a milk tea before ordering my meal.</li><li>I could n't even finish my entire meal!</li><li>The actual meal takes a little longer than most sushi places to make.</li><li>The meal at the end was well balanced and I was satisfied at the end.</li><li>Incredibly attentive service, and a tremendous meal.</li><li>Still a solid, cheap meal, even without the salad.)</li><li>All in all, a great place to go to grab a cheap meal.</li><li>But to enjoy your meal, you ca n't eat there because they have no tables.</li><li>I just recently discovered it thanks to a friend and we really enjoyed our meal here.</li><li>I used to work relatively close to this restaurant and would come here often with friends after work to have a nice relaxing meal and a catch-up.</li><li>I 'll call it an ' un-appetizer' because our meal ended there.</li><li>I went there with a couple of friends and had a pretty good meal.</li><li>Side dishes: lettuce, bean sprouts, kimchii, sweet radish, kimchii flavored radish and peanuts with little dried fish The meal was good but nothing really stood out for me.</li><li>We ordered the set meal ( originally meant for 4 people) and an order of pork bone soup.</li><li>I craved for more veggies in the noodle soup but honestly it was quite a perfect meal and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.</li><li>In fact, it really may be my first time having a meal around Jane and Steeles, but I ended up here nonetheless.</li><li>Meal was just fine and the service was good.</li><li>The only thing good about this meal was their complimentary bread/focaccias, but I 'm not going through that again just for bread.</li><li>The meal is also very big, you could share with another person!</li><li>It would be difficult to find such a good meal for a similar price.</li><li>The meal was 11 Canadian dollars but was still charged 11 US dollars dispite me explaining to them that the US dollar was stronger than the Canadian dollar.</li><li>Really good and satisfying meal.</li><li>Overall, it was a good meal but I do n't think I 'd go back as I usually stick to the smaller type thai restaurants.</li><li>Traditional Thai dessert sticky rice with mango and coconut milk was delish, nice ending to a satisfying meal.</li><li>Note: if you 're looking for a ' good deal meal', try Kinnaree Thai Restaurant, my personal second fave next to this one.</li><li>My impression of this meal is americanized Thai food, that was not that great.</li><li>They both came pretty SMALL for meal size lol.</li><li>After our meal was finished, Mr. Manager gave us the bill, charging for everything we ordered at full price; again, no apology given at this time.</li><li>5/5 ( the faults are mentioned only for balance, overall it was a great meal).</li><li>The thai pumpkin soup that I got was too salty and the remainder of the meal was too bland.</li><li>Summerlicious Lunch of 2015 For $ 18 ( before tax and tip), you get a 3 course meal with an app, main dish, and dessert.</li><li>I would n't let that detour you because I had a very nice meal there during Summerlicious.</li><li>Over all: a horrid, nasty, poor quality and expensive meal.</li><li>The meal went great with Thai Iced Tea which tasted authentic.</li><li>It was a very enjoyable meal and despite the steeper prices, I would definitely come back to eat the curry beef again.</li><li>I went here for the first legit meal after getting my tonsils removed ... maybe I was delusional and craved real food too much ... but it was excellent.</li><li>It had `` wok hey'' sorry I do n't know how to translate that but that 's in chinglish To complete the meal off: Poach Pear in wine sauce and Tropical Ice cream- the poach pear definitely helped to end this wonderful meal or Deep-fried apple and Tropical Ice cream.</li><li>Saving graces of the meal to be honest!</li><li>Overall the meal was disappointing and not cheap.</li><li>It 's Asian Fusion, so not cheap, but it 's a good meal out if you are hanging out at Shops at Don Mills.</li><li>While I enjoyed my meal- particularly the battered beef in my curry- I do n't think I would return to Linda again.</li><li>Its a filling meal.</li><li>If you 're looking for an inexpensive, tasty and filling meal, check this place out.</li><li>Pro tip: do not try to order your meal/ converse with the server in Vietnamese.</li><li>It was only when we ended our meal and had a look at the outdoor restaurant banner and noticed the `` Vietnamese and Chinese Cuisine'' header under the restaurant name, which is fine and makes sense.</li><li>I was very pleased with the meal and enjoyed the quick cafeteria style line system.</li><li>Overall the meal was not the best and it was rather expensive for a sandwich, a side, and a drink.</li><li>Came here after a workout with a few friends, looking for a quick and filling meal to replenish our resources.</li><li>OK let me explain ... nowhere in the city are you going to get a meal for $ 3.00, but here you can ... the issues are they often do not have food.</li><li>Excellent meal.</li><li>The portion sizes ( generous!) and prices ( low!) are very much like other Chinese restaurants, which means $ 10 to $ 15 per person ( after tax and tips) will buy you a very satisfying meal.</li><li>Ordered Lamb soup with a hearty meal best cure for the flu !!</li><li>Disclaimer: this was my first northern Chinese halal meal ever, so I could only review based on if I enjoyed the food and experience.</li><li>Then there was no one in this place at 6:30pm- it 's sushi! there is ALWAYS someone in a sushi restaurant ... oh no: ( The price of the AYCE was decent and we ordered our meal.</li><li>Put them together and it is quite an amazing meal here.</li><li>And since we like Levantine food, we can appreciate a good meal of hummus, ful, falafel, and eggplant.</li><li>This is not the place for authentic Armenian food, but if you are in Victoria Park for whatever reason, you 'll definitely get a satisfying meal here.</li><li>I do n't know anywhere in Toronto where you can eat like a king for 6-8 people, enjoy your meal so heartily, and still come out with a bill around 60-80 dollars.</li><li>The highlight of the entire meal was the salad which was refreshing and helped balance the strong musky flavour of the lamb.</li><li>Solid meal.</li><li>If you have 2 for 1 meal coupon, your meal with a drink will cost about $ 10 which is pretty good considering that 's what you 'd end up paying even at fast food places.</li><li>Not `` I care if you have a good meal'' service.</li><li>Which is fine for a $ 50 or less meal.</li><li>One thing I found out is if you want a candle for your butter you have to ask or they will bring it in a little cup ( if your a seafood fan you want the piping hot butter) My meal comes my crab is cut into small pieces witch I am not a fan of Prefer the whole legs ( personal preference) they were cooked perfect.</li><li>I 've tried my bf 's meal and the lobster is done to perfection.</li><li>The meal came with garlic bread ( Delicious but very buttery!), potato or fries or salad.</li><li>This should have prepared us for the meal we were about to receive.</li><li>Other food: Your meal starts with a free basket of garlic bread.</li><li>I remember paying less for the meal I got last time &amp; getting 2 pieces of naan instead of 1.</li><li>Decent quick meal in a clean environment.</li><li>I 've been to this location many times over the years, and have always had an enjoyable meal.</li><li>Great place to go for a meal, especially for big groups and families, though also works well for singles and couples.</li><li>Honestly, if she just apologized and offered to remake the food and give us better discount, i would write a better review .. if they gave us a free meal, i would definitely come back.</li><li>It was a nice meal coming off a long enough flight and was definitely a comfort food.</li><li>We were still in the middle of our meal and needed it.</li><li>Considering reviewing congee queen is like reviewing Asian Mcdonalds, I immediately said no. However, after coming home after our big meal and thinking about this, I realized that I need to be a better person and ensure that those who stalk me feel rewarded with an easter egg, I shall now write this one out for JT and RS.</li><li>It 's hard not to enjoy a meal when the restaurant makes room for a large lovable group;).</li><li>Dishes will arrive sporadically and often you 'll be almost done your meal before your last dish arrives.</li><li>Second when we were almost in the beginning of our meal, they asked us to leave because they had to close.</li><li>The staff are friendly and the prices are fair ( $ 10/person will get you a good meal).</li><li>45 mins into the meal, I still had n't received this dish.</li><li>Honestly, I am surprised by the amazing ratings here, because my meal tonight was not good.</li><li>In fact, the entire meal was great, I 'd get the lobster again in a heartbeat.</li><li>Park here, and after your meal you can waddle off the food in the Shops at Don Mills.</li><li>Each meal ordered there was a main course + a special drink + dessert.</li><li>Midnight dinner for eight ... and the staff was so helpful in helping us figure out the perfect bubble tea to match our meal.</li><li>I enjoyed the King 's Tea Pork Ribs Noodle meal combo which I upgraded to a hibiscus bubble tea ( it comes with plain green tea).</li><li>I ordered a meal, they are mean they even do n't offer me a bottle of water.</li><li>You can get $ 3 off when you buy a meal and a drink at the same time.</li><li>For the weekend dinner, the meal also comes with some `` extras'' which are not all you can eat, last time I got a skewer of shrimp and scallops, and fried shrimp ( torpedo style).</li><li>As typical for Korean restaurants, they serve a number of side dishes along with your meal, which you can ask to be refilled at any time.</li><li>The meal is okay.</li><li>The overal meal is not impressive but a cheap place to eat for lunch.</li><li>Thanks for the meal but wo n't be coming back though!</li><li>The price was pretty high considering I ordered a basic meal however.</li><li>The meal overall though was still very good.</li><li>The standard 4 set banchan arrived with the meal and I liked that they served their barley tea warm and not scolding hot.</li><li>The prices were not worth the meal.</li><li>Refuses to serve them until you get your meal and are reluctant to give you seconds.</li><li>The chicken was nothing special, though the cheese did help the 2-portion meal be a bit more filling.</li><li>Still a good staple place for dakgalbi, with cheese, ramen, and rice cakes being necessary add ons to make it an awesome meal.</li><li>The servers were very nice, and did n't seem to mind that we lingered for an hour after our meal, chatting away.</li><li>Definitely a go-to for me if I 'm looking for a nice, filling meal with lots of variety.</li><li>Overall, it was a tasty and satisfying meal!</li><li>It 's still a good filling tasty meal, but I have to knock off a star because I had it from them before they started bringing it out fully cooked.</li><li>You can also order sauces from a list to go with your meal.</li><li>Some surprising positives, they give you cold lemon tea with your meal which hits the spot for this kind of meal.</li><li>They also include a bit of dessert with your meal which is a nice touch.</li><li>Hunger gone, well balanced meal and it tasted pretty great!</li><li>Our order was placed and received our meal in perhaps 5 min, great service and very quick!</li><li>Please bring cash or your bank card ... if not your date might have to even pay for your meal ...</li><li>The chefs definitely piled on my veggies very generously and even after sharing my meal, I was very full!</li><li>Suffice to say, it was STUFFED and could be considered a meal for two in itself.</li><li>A great value for a good meal.</li><li>Came here with a friend to grab a quick casual meal.</li><li>Very small restaurant good for a quick meal for maybe 2-4 people max.</li><li>Now I know why the girls who were sitting next to my group did n't finish their meal.</li><li>The only other advice I can give, is not to feel the need to eat everything on your plate, or else you 'll eat up falling asleep after your meal ..</li><li>So, if you go in knowing all this, but knowing you 're going to get an excellent meal from start to finish, with very fresh, very hot food and a dining experience that moves quickly, you 'll be fine.</li><li>Caesar salad- came with my brother 's meal.</li><li>Was served tea, new plates provided during meal, there was a slight wait for the peking duck but that was to be expected but the waiter also did advise that there will be a wait, so no big complaints.</li><li>We had a really nice meal and the service was pretty good since one server sticked to us the entire time.</li><li>Our meal ended up costing $ 144.</li><li>Ariel G. may want to take that trip down memory lane, but this meal was a memory I 'd rather repress.</li><li>Not a fan of the cabbage wraps, but had a full and satisfying meal:) Staff was really friendly as I asked for more sauce about 3 times and they brought it out quickly!</li><li>You order your meal as soon as you walk in the door, which for someone as indecisive as me, is a difficult thing.</li><li>We had a delicious meal, the concept is refreshing, and the service was great.</li><li>To be fair he warmed up a little bit more throughout our meal but not by much.</li><li>But this mixture of methods, changing it seems during the meal, is annoying as well as leads to long delays and confusion between customers and staff.</li><li>You order when you first step in- then you move all the way down the way to pay for your meal- they give you a card and then you sit down wherever you want and then they bring you your meal.</li><li>And we were ready for a nice sit-down meal.</li><li>Great food with socially-conscious management, super stylish, more of a quick, filling meal than the typical sit-down.</li><li>Cavolo ( $ 5 as a side) The highlight of our meal was the insalate!</li><li>There is no fancy chandliers here nor skanky girls in tight black dress, it is def laid back and feels as if you are going to a friend 's house for a home cooked meal.</li><li>But for such treatment and a subpar meal, if you 're expecting me to tip while barely valuing my hard earned dollars and think I do n't know any better ( keeping the tips for yourself ?</li><li>If you 're looking for value or a good meal, there are so many more restaurants along Yonge to choose from other than here.</li><li>All in all, I had a great meal.</li><li>Domestic beers are cheap if you feel like having one with your meal.</li><li>They have a large variety of side dishes that comes with your meal so try not to get too full off that!</li><li>A cheap and cheerful meal though Chowon on Drewry Ave. has a slight edge on quality.</li><li>A fun place to grab some super-casual meal with friends, but somewhat tight seating and average quality.</li><li>It 's a meal for two with lots of meat, lettuce, soon tofu soup, and rice.</li><li>I wish there was more ribs but the meal was pretty filling for 2 people.</li><li>One or two extra slices of ribs would have been perfect, but regardless it was such a satisfying meal.</li><li>This meal is def enough for 2 people and at a very reasonable price ( $ 45).</li><li>You get a slice of watermelon each after you 're done your meal because to help cut the MSG that they put into the soup so you wo n't get thirsty later on.</li><li>I asked for the soup and rice to be taken to go, and that my mackerel be served to me at the restaurant ( my brother was eating his entire meal there).</li><li>My friend asked for a refill of side dishes, but the waiter said they can only refill 3 types for the entire meal even though competing nearby Korean restaurants refill all of them.</li><li>I went on a week night, and at the start of the evening only one server was taking care of all the tables ( but I was there VERY early, like 4:30pm), but towards the end of our meal a couple more staff were there to help.</li><li>Picking just a basket of fried chicken, regardless of small or large, will have you starting your meal with a sizzling foil-lined cast iron skillet of corn.</li><li>The meal comes with complementary 3 flavour vegetables, along with sizzling cream corn.</li><li>Not a memorable meal.</li><li>Had a great meal at the Fry and I have been a frequent customer here coming on various occasions.</li><li>Take out is the way to go really if you want anything resembling a complete meal ( i.e.</li><li>They always load up my pita with everything I like and it makes for a great little meal with lots of veggie options and various sauces.</li><li>The key to enjoying your meal at this restaurant is to recognize it for what it is.</li><li>Of all the days to get a crappy meal this was not the one ... chile please.</li><li>If you go in with the right set of expectations, you should enjoy your meal.</li><li>We also both got a shake to go with our meal and they were really good too.</li><li>We were given plenty of time to chat and sip our drinks after the blissful meal.</li><li>Midway through my meal, my neighbour on my other side ordered some drink with a heart made of chocolate sprinkles/flakes on top!</li><li>They also have meat crepe &amp; sandwich options if you want a meal.</li><li>The chicken is n't the only star in the meal, the rice and coleslaw provides the same amount of attention.</li><li>Very Cheap meal considering a bowl that will fill you up to your hearts content from 5-7 $.</li><li>But anyways, I enjoyed the meal, did not however enjoy the etiquette by the employee.</li><li>And of course, I also usually have the jack fruit milkshake along with my meal, which came in a plastic cup that seemed more suitable if I was ordering take out ... but maybe I 'm just being picky about my dine in experience.</li><li>A quality meal for its price point especially on a cold day, or if you 're feeling kind of sick.</li><li>- What a horrible meal ..</li><li>Called the Epic meal now.</li><li>Cost around $ 90.00 for 3 people to have a drink each with one appetizer and a meal per person.</li><li>Personally, if I were to go for an actual meal, I would recommend it as a good place for brunch.</li><li>As much as people may not like the set up or the idea of helping to serve themselves, it is a cool concept because you can check out all of the stations, take in the delicious scents and really feel out what you are craving for your meal or your dessert.</li><li>You arrive and a card is given to you ... you approach a food station with a plate, gesturing for your selection like Oliver Twist .. the Food Barista will punch your card with the appropriate value of the meal hidden in `` code'' At the end of your meal, your `` code'' is calculated and you then pay $ $ $.</li><li>My meal began by seeking out a table not reserved or occupied ... the crowd this day was in the majority of Grandparents treating their offspring and children to a feast before their flight leaves to Florida .... or Hungary ... or the Baltic 's .....</li><li>Was n't really a good value for money ... for this price, go down the street to Aoyama and have a way better meal!</li><li>The bill surprised me since the `` original'' price of the meal would have been 60ish.</li><li>Overall, our meal was really meh.</li><li>Also with every meal you order comes with miso soup, salad and green tea ice cream for dessert ( almost every meal).</li><li>Have literally just finished my meal ( lunch).</li><li>If you know what LA kalbi is, you will know that 5 measly pieces of bone left at the end of the meal is hardly worth the whopping price tag of $ 18.99.</li><li>After the meal, as we were paying, we informed the server about the rice, she had nothing to say.</li><li>They never check up on your table, and it takes over 30 minutes to get your meal if they bother bringing it to you.</li><li>If you 're looking for a place you can have a quick buffet meal, think of another place ... insulting me by making me wait to be seating in an empty restaurant is not usually what a buffet restaurant wants to happen ... usually be seated, served and leave is the way so they can turn over and seat more people.</li><li>All in all, we ate less than half of our meal- only the cuts of fish that actually looked like normal, fresh fish.</li><li>The best schwarma ever Must try the chicken on the rocks Reasonable prices Very friendly staff The best option for students at York University looking for a good meal.</li><li>We have n't been back since we lived in the neigbhourhood ( 8 years ago) and I do n't think I will go back. even though they gave us a coupon for a free meal.</li><li>I might return for the free meal ( only).</li><li>Weekend mornings are busy, between the special and the fact that a family can go somewhere comfy and get a no-fuss meal in between shopping stops.</li><li>I was ready for a messy meal ... bib and all but everything was just so neat and tidy ( 3/5 stars).</li><li>The Trucker Special: 2 pancakes, 3 eggs, 2 sausages, 2 pieces of bacon, toast, potatoe hash, baked beans .... it was a pretty awesome brunch meal!</li><li>But it was still worth it for a good and different meal, and I am sure to return sometime to try The Caker.</li><li>Flavors are authentic and the purple rice that accompanies your meal is crispy on the edges.</li><li>However, the price is cheap and good because this meal always fills me up, even when I 'm staaaaaarving.</li><li>A very hearty and comforting meal, at a great price as well.</li><li>Before your meal they bring out tasty small dishes of kimchi, bean sprouts and other items to share.</li><li>A good choice if you want a simple warm meal to hold you through the night.</li><li>My favourite dish here is the Vegetable Soon tofu, and at under $ 10 before taxes and tip, it makes a super cheap meal.</li><li>Everything on the menu is under $ 10 and the beer was $ 4 so this is definitely a great option for a really good, cheap meal.</li><li>A complete meal.</li><li>Great place in the winter to grab a quick meal to warm yourself up.</li><li>I could n't finish the crispy rice from the other hot stone pot, I was filled to the brim and the meal was only $ 10.</li><li>Averaging only $ 10 dollar per person, cheap and delicious meal- a definite return!</li><li>Always a great meal to have when it 's cold or if you feel under the weather.</li><li>The rice that comes with the meal is purple and I love the authenticity of the overall meal.</li><li>The rice that comes with the meal is purple and I love the authenticity of the overall meal.</li><li>I enjoy my meal here every time I visit this place.</li><li>Like most other Korean Tofu Soup locations, they had meal options that included a soup, rice, and, of course, side-dishes.</li><li>The highlight to the meal in my opinion was the preparation, presentation and service of the famous Purple sticky rice.</li><li>My friend really enjoyed his meal.</li><li>We sat waiting after we finished our meal, even going as far as stacking our plates to indicate we had long since finished when we realized they likely were n't going to be bringing us our bill and time soon and we would have to go to the front to pay.</li><li>The place is small and the lineups are long during meal hours.</li><li>I will give points for the super cheap prices, I think I paid $ 10 for the meal plus a pop. I will also give points for good service.</li><li>I always get extra spicy kimchi soon tofu and it 's like good ol ' home cooked meal.</li><li>Crack your egg as soon as your soup comes out as that will help cook the egg and it 's a surprise bonus near the end of your meal.</li><li>Usually ban chan are complimentary side dishes that always given with your meal at Korean restaurants.</li><li>Buk Chang Soon Tofu .... been going here for years, it 's a guaranteed good meal.</li><li>The only downside is its far away from home but whenever I 'm in the area its a place I have to consider I want a good inexpensive tasty meal.</li><li>Good thing it 's replenished throughout the meal!</li><li>Overall, pretty nice place for an affordable meal.</li><li>The noorungjee is also super yummy- a really nice way to end your meal.</li><li>When the waiter takes your order, they always ask for your licence plate in case you need to move your car in the middle of your meal.</li><li>A must have for any hearty meal craving.</li><li>They cook for each person, serve them their food, bid farewell and leave and you can enjoy your tasty meal that was cooked fresh right in front of your eyes!</li><li>What really made the night frustrating is towards the end of our meal we wanted to order dessert.</li><li>I would highly recommend this place for a quiet nice meal.</li><li>As you are purchasing a meal, the staff will load the cost on your card which you pay for on your way out.</li><li>I think though I come here when it 's my Birthday and I get a free meal.</li><li>The guacamole definitely added to the overall meal.</li><li>My pizza had around 660cals, obviously not the healthiest meal in the world, but a whole lot closer to what the ideal is!</li><li>Owl is definitely a go to spot for my friends and I when we need a nice-hearty meal!</li><li>It 's 24/7 so I come here whenever I have the munchies or am just looking for a late night meal with friends.</li><li>The kalbi was also good, and sizable for a `` small''- overall a good meal but nothing fantastic ... likely will be back in the future.</li><li>Problem was, the meal was almost all onions and green peppers with very little actual chicken.</li><li>But it 's 24/7 so perfect for those that want a late night meal.</li><li>It 's a humongous meal with a flavour I have n't tasted in any other meal.</li><li>Other than that, it was a pretty average meal! 3/5. it was not as great as people say it is, i had the gam ja tang bone soup and it was very bland and plain, not filling at all, i was hungry after still.</li><li>I told one of the servers about my experience with the meal and he obnoxiously, rudely and un hesitantly said I ca n't order something on the menu and say you dont like it ..</li><li>I expected a fresh meal, straight from the kitchen but what I got was a not so fresh meal, straight from the freezer.</li><li>I expected a fresh meal, straight from the kitchen but what I got was a not so fresh meal, straight from the freezer.</li><li>But other than that, I think this is the perfect meal for a cold winter day!</li><li>The meal was unsatisfying and I could n't finish the food.</li><li>Classic orange decor designed by 1970s industrial psychologists, meant to get on your nerves shortly after you 've consumed your meal and force you out.</li><li>We did n't come for a cheap meal, but the quality of food nor service met our expectation.</li><li>The bill came out to be $ 45 incl tip, so a decent price for a very filling meal.</li><li>We ordered pork dumplings in soup, beef and vegetable meal, wonton soup, vsteamed vegetables and seafood basket.</li><li>***** My favourite part of the meal was a dessert that I forget the name of.</li><li>My meal overall was pretty good ..</li><li>Though we were spoken to relatively quickly, our waitress left halfway through the meal, and her replacement was forgetful and a little bit dippy.</li><li>The meal was pretty good without any real complaints.</li><li>However, the presentation more elegant and was packed with photos of the foods, savouring our appetites of what would be a great meal to come.</li><li>I 'll be coming back to Wimpy 's shortly, for a full meal this time ...</li><li>Being in the area it seemed like all hope was gone for a late night meal until we found this 24 hour joint.</li><li>The breading gets soggy but the fun is n't in having a crispy sandwich rather a savoury meal.</li><li>Not too long after that the lady calls out your number and you 're all set to enjoy your meal.</li><li>Im mad at the reviews that were not so favourable for this place because you prolonged my visit ... that being said this place is small and simple but the meal i had was amazing, 10 bucks for a chicken piled club sandwich with fries it was very good ... i cant wait to go back and try more things on the menu ... these guys do it old school and thank god.</li><li>The meal did n't blow my mind, but it was definitely what I expected.</li><li>It did however make me wish I was at the diner near my house having the same meal.</li><li>At the end of our meal, I made eye contact with I believe to be the owner, I nodded at him, and he actually nodded back, but not in a forced manner, but in a genuine pleasant and thanking manner.</li><li>My review of Steve 's a few weeks back attests that you can get a reasonable meal with coffee included.</li><li>If they had a peanut-free menu but the server keeps telling you that your meal may have come in contact with, or contains peanuts, would you feel safe eating their food ?</li><li>Most dishes are less than $ 10 and you get a bounty of complimentary side dishes along with your meal.</li><li>My meal looks like something I threw together in a rush at home.</li><li>The meal was n't even hot and the service is horrible.</li><li>You could hear the service bell ringing constantly throughout the meal, which was n't a big deal.</li><li>Every time I have a meal here, I leave smelling like a mixture of all sorts of Korean food.</li><li>If you came with a group and want separate bills, walk up to the cashier and they will charge you separately for your meal.</li><li>I would understand her behaviour if she was trying to serve my friend her meal and wanted to ensure there was something under the dish.</li><li>The meal also comes with rice for around.</li><li>Their kalbi is expensive ( $ 15.99 for the meal with rice), but it 's cooked so well and the pieces of kalbi are well-marbled and meaty.</li><li>But I supposed this is sometimes what you have to accept for a cheap meal.</li><li>You can get a meal 100X better at Owl or elsewhere for only a slightly higher bill, plus the service is better.</li><li>After that I waited 45 minutes for my meal to arrive ... it never did.</li><li>Bonus: we walked out of the restaurant smelling like we just had AYCE kbbq, even though we just had a regular meal.</li><li>Total cost of meal was around $ 10.</li><li>Once our table found that out when we were 3/4 finished with our meal, two people struggled not to throw up after eating.)</li><li>If you have a line up when you get there you will realize why after you eat your meal!</li><li>The other table to our left had a big party but a few people were missing their meal and they did n't receive any of the laffa bread that comes with their meal.</li><li>The other table to our left had a big party but a few people were missing their meal and they did n't receive any of the laffa bread that comes with their meal.</li><li>Had to go looking for the meal 3 times &amp; finally we got the food but we had to leave cause lunch is only 1hr !!</li><li>That said, if you come alone, one or two dishes will be more than enough to fill you and you will find yourself bringing home enough leftovers for another small meal.</li><li>Very satisfying. satay on the road has been one of my family 's favorite restaurants since i was a kid. i remember coming here when i was ten and ordering the same thing that i get now, ten years later: cashew nut chicken with an order of steamed rice and the shrimp chips with peanut sauce. first of all, the food tastes delicious. i think there 's been one or two times out of the hundreds of visits to this place where the food tasted a little spicier than usual but other than that, it 's been consistently amazing for close to a decade. i 've had cashew nut chicken at other thai restaurants and it just does n't compare. i ca n't speak about most of their other food but from what i 've experienced they 've been by far the best tasting thai restaurant in and around toronto. the wait staff is quick and friendly for the most part which is great. the atmosphere of the restaurant is nice ... they just re-did it and although i have to say i prefer the original decor which had an authentic thai feel to it, their modern, contemporary approach to their new `` look'' is very pleasing to the eyes and enjoyable to dine at as well. the value of the food is great. my girlfriend and i come here for their lunch special almost every week at least once and have a full meal with a drink that leaves us satisfied for both taste and hunger for usually under $ 10, 15% tip included. how can you beat that ? really. not to mention, you can order shrimp chips and peanut sauce as an appetizer while you wait for your meal, at no charge. i have yet to find another thai restaurant in toronto that has that. five stars to my favorite thai place since i was ten. i was happy to see that they expanded and opened another store on bayview. good for them!</li><li>We both had the grilled fish which kept us going `` om nom nom'', but the cake was sadly dry and a great meal should always be highlighted by a yummy dessert ( IMO).</li><li>For dessert, we shared the Apple Crumble Pie, which was a great end to a nice meal.</li><li>Our three course meal was served.</li><li>This was the first time that for a $ 50 per meal I had to HURRY UP!.</li><li>Overall had a nice meal.</li><li>Overall a satisfying meal with good food.</li><li>All in all, it was a decent meal for the $ 35 price tag.</li><li>The entire meal ( 1 entree plus 1 soup cause of the deal) came to over $ 50 plus tip.</li><li>We had booked the typical ten course meal of assorted BBQ meats, fried chicken, Peking duck, lettuce wrap with minced duck, seafood egg drop soup, lobster, fried fish, veggies, fried rice, fried noodles, and dessert.</li><li>Prices vary between $ 10- $ 15 for a meal not incl drink.</li><li>The `` small'' meal is huge already and can feed two people so it 's not a bad choice for takeout on the way home because you can either pig out, split it with another person or save it for a meal tomorrow.</li><li>I mostly do a `` takeout'' to get my meal and enjoy it at home in peace and quiet with family and a movie.</li><li>When you order a teppanyaki meal, you get soup, salad, the meal, and desert.</li><li>All in all, portion wise, I have never really been able to ever finish my meal.</li><li>Tatami rooms- we did a set course meal and had the unforgettable experience of the Tatami room!</li><li>Not only the chef did a great job in preparation of the meal, the presentation of the food and attending to all customers were done in a timely and professional manner. ( not to mention, It was very entertaining as well- see photos) It 's a little bit pricy but I think it 's very well worth it.</li><li>$ 100 per head for a meal that can be had anywhere in the city for the $ 12 bento box special.</li><li>They charge extra for the salad where other places offer it as part of your meal.</li><li>It still took a long time and I decided to inspect my meal.</li><li>Their portions are very large, so one meal will last for two easily.</li><li>I agree with a previous reviewer, this meal is big enough to be split into two as I could n't finish it!</li><li>I often order this dish as a small meal or a tie-over and Thai One On always uses hearty, fresh ingredients.</li><li>Our server did not come by to check on our meal until the very end when we had finished our food.</li><li>Arrived hot and quickly, only waited about 10 minutes for the meal to come.</li><li>While my friend went for a meal- the salmon with veggies which he said was pretty good- I just wanted some dessert so I tried the caramel brownie.</li><li>Went here for dinner on a Saturday- got a great seat on the patio and had an amazing meal!</li><li>My go to place for just hanging out and having a meal with a friend.</li><li>First, the brisket tasted exactly like a roast, not some 12 hour slow-cooked meal like it was supposed to be.</li><li>And here 's the best part -- as we were getting up to leave, the only English speaking waiter came over to ask us how was our meal was.</li><li>He basically hovered over our table for half the meal and he would n't stop saying how we 're doing things wrong.</li><li>He eventually disappeared towards the end of our meal and it went from over-service to completely lack of service.</li><li>Be prepared to smell like oil and food after your meal!</li><li>I was a little disappointed that no one came to check to see how our meal was and if we needed anything.</li><li>The price for such a meal is about $ 16 including tax and tips.</li><li>Everyone who had steak was very satisfied with their meal.</li><li>I would have to say, if you love steak and want a great meal at a restaurant that feels like home, you should definitely come to the Steak Pit.</li><li>This was definitely the best meal I have had at a restaurant in a long time !!</li><li>The bill for this lousy meal was over 80 dollars.</li><li>Sure it might not be GOUMET but it 's definitely a good quality meal.</li><li>Great way of getting rid of post-exam stress; probably the best meal I 've had yet, out with friends.</li><li>They dont bring you all meal at once, they confuses you with small portions every 10-15 minutes, definitely i wont step in there in a long time ...</li><li>The portions are larger than I expected, I could barely even dig into my main of my bento ' complete meal'.</li><li>A meal with these two items + all the other nice stuff will cost you approximately $ 32 after tax- what to complain ?</li><li>If you want a cheap meal and are in the area, step in, otherwise ...</li><li>My boyfriend and I went here and I felt that we got this great deal on a shared meal that included:- a medium sized lobster cooked or as sashimi- tempura- rice x2- lamb rack- salmon filet- mussel soup x 2- salad x2 This entire meal would 've been around $ 60 altogether, which I think is a great deal!</li><li>The food quality was very good and we were satisfied with our meal.</li><li>Overall a rather comforting meal.</li><li>We decided to try the Teppanyaki Feast ( $ 98.50 for four) The meal consisted of: 1.</li><li>I 've been a regular here a lot, with a few friends, always enjoy a nice meal here.</li><li>Its a nice place to have a nice filling complete meal.</li><li>A meal for about $ 15.00 will include a platter so salmon sushi and California rolls, salad, miso soup, tempura, teriyaki steak, grilled pork and the list goes on.</li><li>That is just one choice of only one meal ...</li><li>I simply shared my meal with the people I was there with.</li><li>Wo n't be surprised if everyone gets sick after the epic meal fail.</li><li>Its just OK and thats the best i can say. for $ 10 i got what i would call a decent meal, its just that if i compare it to the burger i had on the weekend i would surely pick the other place if given the choice and i was in the area.</li><li>The Highlights:- This place is gorgeous both inside and out- Ample amount of seating for both small and big groups- The waiters are all very professional and seasoned in the food serving business ( you wo n't find your neighbor 's 16 year old kid working here)- Free hors d' oeuvres at the start of your meal ( pickles, olives, cottage cheese, and garlic bread)- Reasonable prices ( all main entrees come with a salad or soup of the day ... a good amount too)- Parking is a plenty and free- Desserts are made on site and delicious ... and you can get it for a low price- Bottomless coffee for $ 1.75- Quiet so you can carry on a conversation with your dining companions I will definitely be back.</li><li>As this was a surprise birthday dinner, at the end of my meal, the staff brought out a piece of cheesecake with a lit candle ( no singing involved thank you very much).</li><li>Recently dined here and meal was nothing to rave about.</li><li>My duck was the highlight of the meal ( oh so tender and juicy), but my dad 's version was tough and not great.</li><li>David Duncan House is a great place for a fancy meal.</li><li>Near the end of the meal we had to go look for our own milk and brown sugar because our waiter was nowhere to be found.</li><li>I go out to eat so someone else can cook me a good meal.</li><li>Near to the end of our meal, the waitress came over and ask if I have a voucher ( We did n't ask for a bill).</li><li>The only downside ( as far as I recall) is I believe the meal is more expensive if you go in the evening or on the weekend.</li><li>Definitely recommended for a good meal!</li><li>I filled two bowls for one meal which came out to one bowl at the end, The guy working the grill was friendly and fast, The buffet was great, lots of options, I loved the shau mai ( which I know I did n't spell correctly) and the lotus seed bun as well as the fried goyza ( again another spelling mistake;)) The dessert was nearly the best part of the entire meal, there was a lot of options and the slush machine and chocolate fountain had to be my favriote.</li><li>I filled two bowls for one meal which came out to one bowl at the end, The guy working the grill was friendly and fast, The buffet was great, lots of options, I loved the shau mai ( which I know I did n't spell correctly) and the lotus seed bun as well as the fried goyza ( again another spelling mistake;)) The dessert was nearly the best part of the entire meal, there was a lot of options and the slush machine and chocolate fountain had to be my favriote.</li><li>I made a rookie mistake of piling on the sauce ... so much so that my oodles were literally drowning in it ... so it made my meal not as tasty as I had hoped.</li><li>In any case my meal was good and I liked the do it yourself options.</li><li>This is always great, I am a big noodle fan so this is great for me when I want a stackin ' meal!</li><li>Meal Structure &amp;
