<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1032' %><h2>dinner portions<br />occurrence: 4</h2><div><ol><li>2/5 the food is not bad, delicious actually but honestly the dinner portions are average at best, making me think they are inconsistent since others have said that they are huge.</li><li>Best dish is the panang curry- Beef panang ( lunch and dinner portions are prepared differently- dinner is crispy), or my favourite, the Thai Islamic Noodles with shrimp and chicken.</li><li>This review covers side dishes so I 'll revise if needed when I go back and sample the dinner portions.</li><li>Likewise the dinner portions are slightly too small for the price they charge.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
