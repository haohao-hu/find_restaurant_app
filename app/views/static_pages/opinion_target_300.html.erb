<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 300' %><h2>guacamole<br />occurrence: 14</h2><div><ol><li>Frankly, I only stuck with the sour cream b/c the guacamole tasted bad and looked unappealing, and the salsa was quite literally shrimp cocktail sauce.</li><li>I also ordered their California burger with guacamole, bacon, sundried tomatoes, mayo and pepper jack cheese.</li><li>It was presented beautifully, with guacamole, salsa, pickled ginger on watermelon tortilla chips.</li><li>What I loved:- extra cheese included many choices such as goat cheese, cheddar and Monterey Jack- extra bacon included 2-3 slices- guacamole was free- lots of great fixings to order from, veggies were also fresh ...- so much free sauce and spices ...</li><li>The burger was moist and tasty, it hit the spot with a Mexican twist to it, the guacamole was a nice touch.</li><li>They 're one of the few burger chains that do n't charge extra for guacamole!</li><li>We just got the regular burger with a pile high of additional toppings: mango chutney, guacamole, blue cheese, Cajun pepper etc ... You can tell this is gourmet when you can add chutney to your burger!</li><li>I ordered a large steak burrito and they barely put any steak and the guacamole is an extra dollar.</li><li>Salsa was n't that great, guacamole was good though, soups and other dishes definitely need more tending too.</li><li>I think most ingredients are done in house ( salsa, guacamole).</li><li>The burger came with guacamole, bacon, onions, tomatoes, lettuce, a lot of cheese and a pickle .... the side was half onion rings half fries ( first time I ever see this kind of side at a pub ?).</li><li>Charging extra for guacamole ( especially when it 's under-ripe) is never welcome either.</li><li>They also offer an above average homemade guacamole for a $ 0.75 charge.</li><li>The guacamole definitely added to the overall meal.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
