<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1716' %><h2>bap<br />occurrence: 2</h2><div><ol><li>With a wealth of other sushi offerings on Yonge street it might be well advised to make a detour elsewhere. alway busy, like ram-crammed. the service tends to be a bit harried, but always friendly. the hae-dup bap is good here, if not typical. except they have two options: japanese-style or korean-style. js is chunks of fish and ks is slivers. personally, i prefer the ks, because the fish gets incorporated into the salad and rice so each mouthful is balanced. nothing to scream about- positively or negatively. just a good option. oh, the lighting is glaringly bright. do n't bring an ugly date.</li><li>( My friend caved in and got this though) Bi Bam Bap was $ 10.99 and I did n't realize how much of a rip off that was until I went to another korean restaurant today and got a similar portion of bi bam bap for $ 7.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
