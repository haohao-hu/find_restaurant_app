<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1111' %><h2>brunch spot<br />occurrence: 4</h2><div><ol><li>Really good breakfast/ brunch spot in Toronto.</li><li>Expect a line up at this family-run brunch spot- the ambiance definitely has a `` diner'' feel to it and the menu options offer more than the average brunch place.</li><li>Definitely a recommendation, but note that they accept cash and debit only, no credit cards. very nice brunch spot, warm cozy environment and nice food. we went in at around 11:15am on a saturday, no queue and had free booths, order two benedict natasha ( that 's egg benedict with smoked salmon and pancake instead of english muffin). we were a little bit surprised with the pancake-based benny, which turned out to be very yum !! i loved it much! we also tried to get the english muffin one, but it was not as good, a bit too toasted and crusty for benny. we would totally recommend the pancake-based ones! a 10-min walk from Lawrence subway station, it was a rather sunny and warm day so it all came to a perfect brunch day!</li><li>Overall, a mid priced lovely brunch spot.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
