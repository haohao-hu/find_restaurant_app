at this location, the bar is king.</li><li>However, I like to look at Boston Pizza restaurants as a sports bar.</li><li>A clean, modern technologically capable sports bar.</li><li>You 're in a SPORTS bar!</li><li>It always looked like such a posh place, hence the bar was set high.</li><li>I really do not know if it is trying to be a bar, breakfast joint, evening supper place, or something in between.</li><li>The lighting is dimmed, with comfy booths, and a full bar.</li><li>My overall impression was of a chilled out sports bar.</li><li>Yes, I know St. Louis is a franchise bar.</li><li>The environment, service and popularity of this place makes it the bar to be in the area.</li><li>The bar here is nice too.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
