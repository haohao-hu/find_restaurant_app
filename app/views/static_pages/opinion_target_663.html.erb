<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 663' %><h2>Thai dishes<br />occurrence: 5</h2><div><ol><li>The menu consists of Chinese and Thai dishes.</li><li>The sister restaurant of the famous Salad King on Yonge and Dundas, has opened its doors to the North York crowd featuring traditional Thai dishes in a location that could have not been more perfect, with a decor that could have not been more Thai.</li><li>Their Thai dishes are decent but like I said, the prices are a bit high for the small portion you get but very tasty.</li><li>Also, their Singaporean Vermacelli, their Yeung Chow Fried Rice, their beef Ho Phun .... well, any of their noodles and fried rice are awesome. oh, but do n't try their Thai dishes ..... it 's not their forte.</li><li>Overall, it 's a nice place to go but I would just be cautious with their Thai dishes.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
