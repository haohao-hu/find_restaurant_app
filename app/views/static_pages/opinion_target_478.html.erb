<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 478' %><h2>lobster tail<br />occurrence: 8</h2><div><ol><li>I thought the lobster tail would be tiny, but it was nice, plump and tasted really fresh.</li><li>Between two people we ordered appetiter ' this and that', prime rib, filet chimichurri with added side of lobster tail.</li><li>For dinner I ordered the 2lb king crab dinner market price witch was $ 86 and a lobster tail $ while we were at the table a waitress was showing a almost four lb lobster to a child I must admit looked delicious.</li><li>The lobster tail came with a bread crumb topping on it and was slightly over cooked but still good.</li><li>We ordered the escargot, seafood platter ( I think that 's what it was called, it consisted of shrimp, salmon, lobster tail, and another type of fish ... all very delicious), and 1.5lbs of lobster broiled ( highly recommend very delicious), garlic bread, and baked potato.</li><li>Lobster Tail &amp; Prime Filet of Beef ( Aoi menu) The lobster tail was delicious- absolutely delicious.</li><li>Their lobster tail is not only nicely presented ( with half a lemon placed inside a small gauze baggie tied with a ribbon so your fingers dont get sticky or have the seeds falling out) but it was also very generous in portion size and cooked almost perfectly ( just a tad overcooked for my liking).</li><li>We ordered a prime rib ( my fav!) wanted it rare, but it came out kind of medium-ish and got a seafood platter ( $ 65) which was not that amazing, 1 lobster tail, 1 jumbo shrimp, 2 oysters Rockefeller, some scallops, king crab/Alaskan king crab legs. sounds like a lot, but it is n't cause it all fits into one plate! but anyways overall the price is fair and the food is good, just not the best.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
