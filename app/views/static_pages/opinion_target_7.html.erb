<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 7' %><h2>dishes<br />occurrence: 696</h2><div><ol><li>For a simple restaurant in a food court, they sure know how to season their dishes appropriately.</li><li>There are also many packaged foods that can help the cook who is not so familiar to the dishes.</li><li>Every other day, for nearly 6 years, I walked by Cuisine of India and never really paid it much attention until people who lived no where nearby started recommending it. then i began to notice that lux cars were always parked there; it 's one of the only places around this subway travellers ' strip with a parking lot in front of the restaurant. and, as far as I can tell, it 's free to park. but certainly there 's more than the parking that caused these commuters from other parts of the city to rave about Cuisine of India. driving is one thing, but in this weather, i wondered,' is it worth walking ? ' so, i rallied my girlfriends living nearby to see just why commuters from other parts of the city were flocking. we got the impression that few local residents ever visited, since the host quizically looked at us ( the group of asian girls) when we entered and waited to be seated. after establishing that, indeed, we were there to eat, yes, food from Cuisine of India, the service was attentive, patient, and warm. the a la carte portions at Cuisine of India are small, and yet incredibly rich. so you can sample a few and be full, without getting a food baby. unfortunately, i do n't remember the names of the dishes we tried, but i recall that the curried cauliflower dish was very well-spiced, without being spicy. the naan are excellent, as are the spicy cracker-like flatbreads. the latter are served while you wait for your meal and the heat really does hit after a few nibbles, so pace yourself as you wait for your meal.</li><li>I guess there simply are dishes that are great and other that I 'd never put above the `` I 'm never ordering that again'' category.</li><li>We ordered:- shrimp dumpling ( har gow): the skin was very thick, which is not generally the case for these type of dishes.</li><li>The servers are quick to greet, take drinks orders, provide extra napkins, take away dishes and etc.</li><li>I 'm a 115lbs female and if I thought the portion was too small, I imagine if you have a man-sized appetite you 'd have to order 3 dishes for yourself.</li><li>I like the value and quality of the dishes and I will be coming back as long as you keep it up!</li><li>They also serve complimentary side dishes before your order.</li><li>Like most Korean places, once you place your order -- you get some yummie side dishes &amp; cold half slice, cut in quarter orange --- along with your cost of damage to your wallet.</li><li>They have the best prices and food was good with good side dishes ( even as a takeout customer).</li><li>When I compared the supposedly `` handmade'' noodles to the black bean noodle dish, the noodles in both dishes were the same- not handmade at all.</li><li>The menu has Chinese/Korean and with English description of what each dishes are.</li><li>They serve 3 other side dishes: radish ( white), kimchi, and another kind of radish ( seasoned with that Korean red sauce).</li><li>The other dishes are par, usual broken rice dishes and some Thai stir fries in the mix.</li><li>Generally, the dishes are consistent.</li><li>Attentive service Tasty dishes: Green chicken Thai curry, Red tofu Thai curry Mango salad big &amp; tasty 1. they have very cute tea cups.</li><li>Options for everyone, including loads of veggie/vegan and gluten-free dishes.</li><li>My co-workers and I have noticed that some of the dishes that are very rich can leave you with that uncomfortable bloating feeling afterward.</li><li>Both times I 've ordered dishes here they were okay- definitely on par with Spring Rolls.</li><li>One of the more impressive dishes was a fried chicken with a glutinous rice stuffing.</li><li>Usually, the dishes are pretty unique.</li><li>Definitely avoid the non-greek dishes, like falafel and hamburger.</li><li>Only and ONLY when it 's fresh is when this Filipino snack favourite is crispy and pleasant to eat, just like any fried battered dishes.</li><li>Some of your dishes are really good, it would really suck if a person 's experience gets overshadowed with one dish that 's pretty hard to mess up.</li><li>They have a varity of different dishes.</li><li>This may sound like hyperbole, but the best dishes available at Richlee 's Ristorante are on par with the best dishes in Rome and Florence and Milan.</li><li>This may sound like hyperbole, but the best dishes available at Richlee 's Ristorante are on par with the best dishes in Rome and Florence and Milan.</li><li>However, I did not expect the food to be caught in that time warp as well, as the dishes we ordered definitely tasted like the food we had dining out growing up ( yup, aged myself!).</li><li>That 's right -- the allegations are bold but so are the flavours that entail in these dishes.</li><li>The dishes are big and the waiters are friendly.</li><li>Considering most places raise their prices every 8-12 months, I 'm impressed! 3) My biggest complaint with most Chinese food places is that you have to order each dish separately, so if a group of people want fried rice, noodles, and a few different meats, they 'd have to order about $ 40 worth of dishes and then divide it up themselves.</li><li>It was OK for all you can eat sushi and had lots of dishes to choose from.</li><li>Was n't overly impressed with the dishes and flavour/freshness of the fish, but service was good and all the dishes came out well.</li><li>The dessert menu was disappointing ( the dishes look a lot more appealing than they taste).</li><li>The dishes were delicious.</li><li>Overall, it 's a nice combination of Japanese and Korean dishes executed exceptionally well.</li><li>It 's a long menu so it will take me several visits to try more of their dishes.</li><li>The manager and owner both came to greet our table and brought over complimentary appetizers and side dishes.</li><li>Quick at removing empty dishes, continuous refill of tea and water.</li><li>We ordered a few dishes ( sashimi combo, maki roll and stir fry soba noodles).</li><li>I thought to myself that maybe their cooked dishes just was n't their forte and that their sashimi and rolls would make up for it.</li><li>Most dishes were served rapidly and in rapid succession.</li><li>The portion size of all their dishes is small compared to other sushi restaurants.</li><li>Based on what my wife and kids ( 21 &amp; 16) order, it 's obvious that their dishes are prepared with the same love and attention as my VM.</li><li>The thought the food was average but my husband enjoyed all his dishes.</li><li>Louise and Leanne were great and they do offer cooking classes where you can learn how to make some of their amazing dishes.</li><li>Try the pidi ( Turkish pizza-like dishes) too.</li><li>We all tasted each other 's dishes and everything was delicious!</li><li>I am not so sure about the other dishes, as I have only tried the lasagna and it is average.</li><li>Some dishes cost a little more, but others are very reasonably priced.</li><li>Ordered a number of dishes for dinner on Friday night: Sweet and Sour Chicken Mixed vegetables with almonds Chicken Fried Rice Shanghai Noodles ( on the recommendation of other reviewers) Cantonese Chow Mein Wonton Soup Siu Mai Eggplant with Black Bean Sauce ( again on recommendation) All dishes were ok.</li><li>One bad thing is that because there is n't much flavor, it 's hard to distinguish their dishes from each other- chicken/beef this tastes very similar to chicken/beef that.</li><li>I like how I have a bunch of small dishes to munch on while waiting for the food.</li><li>The dishes were pretty We had Kalbi patty Japchae- I do n't know that I 've had these sweet potato noodles served over ( hard) rice before Tonkatsu set I really like Korean food and this it was small very bland and disappointing.</li><li>I have yet to find another restaurant that beats this place in quality of food and side dishes.</li><li>They make sure to refill your side dishes and check up on you.</li><li>Yelp App I found this place to satisfy my craving of bibimbap and some tasty Korean side dishes.</li><li>Side dishes are very fresh as well.</li><li>Banchan ( side dishes) are very fresh and delicious.</li><li>Plus, the side dishes!</li><li>Portions are a good size, a nice variety in the menu, and excellent side dishes!</li><li>We both liked our food and would come back to try out other dishes ...</li><li>During my meal I was asked how my meal was and on two different occasions she asked if I wanted more side dishes.</li><li>I declined because I was dinning alone this time and had more than enough side dishes for myself.</li><li>They demanded that we order at least 8 dishes since we are occupying 8 seats.</li><li>Still the service was good and so were the little side dishes.</li><li>On the bright side, the side dishes were really good, possibly one of the few places I 've been to that had good side dishes.</li><li>Their complimentary side dishes were better than the ones I had at other Korean restaurants in GTA.</li><li>Even though the restaurant was only half-full, the waitress did not refill our teapot or take away empty dishes.</li><li>We could see them standing there chatting, but each time, we had to signal them to refill our teapot or clear dishes.</li><li>Very flavorful dishes and all of them come out steaming hot as Asian food should!</li><li>They are super smart about allocating the side dishes too- they give you a little bit of each for sampling, and when you ask for more of your favourites, they 'll give you more generous amounts.</li><li>As with all Korean restaurants we got the normal selection of side dishes.</li><li>Overall, I would come back to the other dishes, including their ginseng chicken soup, which is what it looks like it is known for!</li><li>I believe we had a good 5-6 dishes.</li><li>Delicious side dishes.</li><li>Also, I was a little peeved that they could n't deliver as my order was just under $ 30.00 Ok, I only tried 2 dishes here: the supposedly `` dry sauteed'' Szechuan beef ( it was fried below at least 1 foot of oil) and the special prawns ( smothered in a sweet and sour suace).</li><li>Do n't shy away from ordering the dishes `` hot''.</li><li>Moving on to the main dishes, the Shrimp sizzler tasted more Indian than Chinese, even with the spring onions and crisp veggies, a bit like how my grandma makes it ( her cooking is Burmese/Indian influenced).</li><li>I focused on the non-fried beef and chicken dishes with the sauces on the rice from some of the other dishes.</li><li>Very professional staff and high quality dishes are why I give it 3 stars and would come back to see what a non-fried experience would be like.</li><li>Also ordered the Broccoli in garlic sauce but did not like this dish as it is actually sweet and did n't go well with the other dishes.</li><li>Also the entrée dishes were spicy, as expected- just a warning if you do n't like spicy food.</li><li>We must 've ordered about a dozen dishes with some rice, a few bottles of Tsing Tao beer, and soda and the total bill was only $ 190 + tip for the eleven of us.</li><li>I went here hoping to get some of the dishes I miss so much since Yen Ching in Bayview Village closed down, so this review might not be unbiased ...</li><li>The crispy dishes have an awesome combination of textures and flavours.</li><li>All dishes are reasonably priced and large enough to share with a party of 5-6; with 3, I definitely had enough leftovers.</li><li>It was alright, but I 'll have to go back with some people to try some other dishes.</li><li>On the plus side, the dishes were very warm and the portions were huge.</li><li>Especially when ordering more than 1 or 2 dishes.</li><li>All were among the best versions of those dishes we 've ever had.</li><li>Most dishes here are good.</li><li>First time, all dishes were great, fried pork chop, marinated raw crab, and tofu soup Restaurant: Jung Soo Nae Cuisine: Korean Location: North York Address: 5754 Yonge St Price Range: ~ $ 10 1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent Food: 3.5 Service: 3 Ambiance: 2 Overall: 3.5 Extra information:* 2 locations owned by 2 different owner* Lunch menu avail* Seasonal menu avail Jung Soo Nae is what you call a ' hole in the wall' restaurant.</li><li>Luckily, we got the last table available, we sat down and started to order =) Here are the side dishes.</li><li>The raw crab here is not my type, but the seafood pancake is nice, the fried fish is delish, spicy chicken pot is good but they give less chicken than lim ga nei, side dishes r good Service here is friendly Small family-owned restaurant tucked away under the apartment complex.</li><li>And when we asked for refill the side dishes, the waitress replied `` this many ?</li><li>We can only do refill 3 side dishes for you".</li><li>However we saw her have no problem refilled more than 3 side dishes for other tables.</li><li>Portions were ample and side dishes were all amazing.</li><li>Based on just 2 dishes, I ca n't say if it 's superior to other restaurants.</li><li>All their hot dishes are oversauced and too salty.</li><li>But I did n't mind because I enjoyed talking with my family and every dishes were fresh and hot.</li><li>The chicken in both these dishes wasnt cut up properly, the broccoli pieces were the size of my fist ... i could go go on ...</li><li>It really took away from the experience as our dishes kept piling up.</li><li>We ordered 6 dishes and were told 50- 60 minutes delivery.</li><li>All the dishes were very hot and completely as advertised.</li><li>Two Chop Suey dishes were still crisp and fresh, one with tender beef and the other with tasty Chicken breast slices.</li><li>Chop Suey dishes can steam in the container during travel time making the Sprouts wilt.</li><li>She often overcharges on the listed menu price of dishes ( $ 7.50 instead of $ 6.75, etc) and adds other random charges to your bill.</li><li>There are 2 dishes I would recommend, 1. lunch special C, the vermicelli and beef skewers with a spring roll for $ 7.75 and/or 2. lunch special B, the lemongrass porkchop on rice ( it also includes a hot/sour soup) for $ 7.50.</li><li>This Pho place serves not just Vietnamese pho but rice/noodle dishes, Malay curries, satays &amp; roti.</li><li>Perhaps the rice/curry dishes may be better, I do n't know.</li><li>The total was $ 35 for the three dishes, not too bad.</li><li>Recommend dishes: Fish/Beef in spicy pungent sauce, mo yu duck, fu qi fei pian, spicy chicken, A choy with Garlic.</li><li>Yet there they are, crappy canned black olives, scattered over many of the classic dishes on their menu.</li><li>It 's not terrible and I think I 'll come back one day but the food quality felt consistently average across the meal and that sentiment was shared by everyone at my table across a variety of different dishes.</li><li>Both dishes tasted great.</li><li>Although I enjoy their sushi, their cooked dishes are TERRIBLE.</li><li>Serving with miso soup and 2 side dishes.</li><li>I ordered four dishes, a lot for my tiny frame.</li><li>The second time I came my server was this sweet younger lady who was patient enough to explain to me the various dishes and the ingredients.</li><li>First the food- some of their dishes taste really good and are really well prepared.</li><li>The quality has gone down because their dishes are more watered down now and they giving miserly portions of vegetables/chicken with lots and lots of rice.</li><li>This is good, healthy, solid, basic fare without any hype or pretence. nice try but russian food is not authentic middle eastern food! not what i was looking for at all. they have some `` middle eastern style'' dishes but like i said, not authentic. definitely not going back.</li><li>The chicken breast that came with Chris ' special was a piece of brick that could have been used as a sponge to wash your dishes.</li><li>So yummy and dishes come with a mountain of fries.</li><li>My other coworkers had the burgers off the lunch specials and all the dishes looked great and were all under $ 20 and very tasty.</li><li>I expect any restaurant I go to, especially Indian to tell me that I ca n't have butter chicken but to tell me that some of the most basic dishes are made with peanuts and nuts is beyond ridiculous.</li><li>Some of the their other dishes are quite good ( biryani), but the curries are often quite oily.</li><li>Their cooked dishes ( teriyaki chicken, teriyaki salmon, etc.) are not too special but what really impresses me is their yam maki.</li><li>Chinease dishes- also flavourless, infact I have never had such a bad fried rice.</li><li>Also, the Korean side dishes were plentiful and tasty as well as the free mackerel and and pancake dish that we got at the beginning ... those were all awesome and filling.</li><li>And I 'll second that comment about getting small dishes on the house.</li><li>Tiny sandwiches Paramount serves up some good tasting Middle Eastern Food, including some popular and familiar dishes, like shawarma, falafel, lentil soup, shish tawouk ( shish kabob), and more.</li><li>While my cousins seemed to enjoy their dishes, I must say that although the dish that mom and I had was quite tasty, we wish we could have enjoyed it more.</li><li>I found the soup ( borsch and harcho) delicious but the main dishes were less than satisfactory.</li><li>Some of the dishes are not available every night but also has a limited quantity if available.</li><li>All dishes were decent for the prices ( highest was $ 8.99 for the seafood dish), though the chow mein was n't cooked for long enough as it was still too crunchy.</li><li>We always order enough dishes to have leftovers for the next day ... but ordering the same amount of food from Sun Star left us with no leftovers because of the small portions.</li><li>When my GF and I go out for Chinese, we usually order 3 dishes and have more than enough left over for lunch the next day.</li><li>Coming here, we find we need to order 4 dishes to be able to do the same.</li><li>The dishes themselves are fairly cheap, and were decent enough.</li><li>The best dishes seem to be the stir fried variety ( fried chicken with bits of garlic, shrimp with shells in superior soy, most veggies).</li><li>Most dishes are on the smaller size portions, compared to most other cantonese places in the other areas I mentioned above.</li><li>The chicken parm was a good sandwich and both dishes were priced fairly.</li><li>Perhaps the other dishes are better, I 'm not recommending this place but I 'm also not going to tell people to stay away.</li><li>For mains, it would seem we were blessed with gifts from Poseidon as 4 of the 5 dishes hailed from the sea.</li><li>Do they even taste their dishes before putting them out ?</li><li>Grilled Calamari incredibly unappetizing ... arrives literally smothered in a salsa-like concoction of chopped tomato and other Impossible to discern green spices ... other dishes, less offensive ... but all uninspiring.</li><li>We ordered about 10 different dishes and we enjoyed them all.</li><li>Tried the crispy pork that everyone recommends, it 's not bad, has crispy skin but the meat is on the dry side, definitely tried much better one elsewhere Since we came in 5, we got to try multiple dishes.</li><li>We did n't order much because we were about to head to a Yelp event with food but the three dishes ended up being plenty as an entire meal for 5ppl!</li><li>The broth was good, the noodles seemed fresh, meat portion was decent. good sign What lacked was the portion sizes were smaller than the typical Pho restaurant and side dishes.</li><li>I enjoy the durian shakes, as well as the various vermicelli dishes.</li><li>The friends I dined with ordered pho, vermicelli, and shredded pork rolls for appetizers, and were equally happy with their dishes.</li><li>We always order 2- 3 dishes when dining in and 4 more for take-out.</li><li>I absolutely love this place for pho and the other dishes it has to offer.</li><li>I have n't tried the other dishes they offer but I highly recommend this dish!</li><li>The dishes are all all subpar.</li><li>And unlimited side dishes too !!!!</li><li>There are some dishes that are meant to be share, as sharing is caring ?! or just some of the dishes are suppose to serve 2 and up ?</li><li>Other dishes like bulgogi, BBQ duck ( available on the board), lamb stew are all very good.</li><li>I thought it lacked flavour, but it was the dish that kept giving as 3 dishes came ou of this one pot.</li><li>There were about 6 side dishes, nice sized.</li><li>The dishes are nice.</li><li>1 hr to get food and I 'm still waiting on 3/4 of my other dishes.</li><li>Food came out speedy, empty dishes were cleared promptly and drinks were always refilled.</li><li>The yuzu salmon sashimi and beef tataki sashimi dishes are the standout dishes that Sushi Legend has chosen to set them apart in the competitive world of AYCE japanese in Toronto.</li><li>There is a wide variety of dishes to choose from and the quality of food was pretty good.</li><li>Other dishes like grilled salmon, fried tofu, chicken skewers are also recommended.</li><li>Today, we realized that our table was empty for longer than it had food on it ... at least they 're quick with clearing the dishes.</li><li>Ambience ( 4/5): The place has a modern look to it with some decorations that seem random, but the booths are large and roomy for 4 people so it was a great place to eat in:) I do not like AYCE because of the lack of quality, the uncreative cookie cutter rolls and dishes BUT sushi legend actually wowed me.</li><li>Lots of staff wandering around means your order sheet is taken quickly once shoved in the air and empty dishes are cleared away within seconds of emptying.</li><li>I want to recommend some favorite dishes but i realized i love a lots of them. scallop sashimi I believe they use different grade from other AYCE place, fresher and you can obviously tell they are all jumbo size. the salmon sashimi with herb sauce is in my must eat list ... etc ....... try them out, you wont be disappointed.</li><li>Decent food, sushi was whatever but I enjoyed the warm dishes.</li><li>Those were below disappointing .. but I should of known those kind of dishes were no good at any AYCE since they do n't specialize in that anyways.</li><li>No dishes were wiped out onto the table.</li><li>We later realized that the cockroach came from one of the dishes ( probably the edamame).</li><li>Anyways i had a great experience and i will be coming back another time. food is great servers are not. although our dishes were constantly brought out and picked up promptly the servers would throw dishes on to the table and even the bill as if they are giving food to dogs ... the food was delicious but too bad the waitresses had to ruin the experience I come here quite a bit and it never disappoints.</li><li>Anyways i had a great

and even the bill as if they are giving food to dogs ... the food was delicious but too bad the waitresses had to ruin the experience I come here quite a bit and it never disappoints.</li><li>At one point we sat around for 15 minutes with an empty table, having to call to 4 staff members that we were still missing 6 dishes.</li><li>The waitresses and waiters removed the empty dishes quickly.</li><li>The sashimi was fresh, and the other dishes were yummy!</li><li>I 'll be honest, when a Korean restaurant only serves 2 side dishes, usually I wo n't come back- I think that 's what most people come for.</li><li>However, I think this restaurant caters more towards Koreans, as the dishes are more traditional.</li><li>The dishes were brought one by one, and since they 're really small and we 're hungry, it was like they 're taming us like animals.</li><li>Finally made the trip for dinner with some family and that 's the best way to dine at Sampaguita so you can order multiple dishes and share family-style.</li><li>Still an ok dish though) Lots of other great dishes served to other tables.</li><li>Cleanliness: tables, chairs, cutlery &amp; dishes were in good condition.</li><li>Wide variety of dishes.</li><li>I personally like the following dishes:- Spring rolls ( very very crispy_- fried butter chicken wings ( Juicy, and butterly tasty)- vietnam style pancake What 's else:- You ca n't really comment on the service, you know why,- I do n't like the fact that there are tables right besides the washroom ( this is just personal preference).</li><li>We ordered three dishes between the two of us, probably too much food.</li><li>Then the main courses came, as we had steaks last night we chose dishes involving fish.</li><li>They do n't really give you much ban chan ( Korean side dishes).</li><li>Four side dishes.</li><li>I have n't tried their other dishes but they would use the same pork or chicken in the sandwich as they would for their dishes.</li><li>I have n't tried their other dishes but they would use the same pork or chicken in the sandwich as they would for their dishes.</li><li>So I can ascertain that the same quality and skill in their cooking would apply to their other dishes.</li><li>Did n't want to make a scandal, so asked the guy who took away the dishes if the mold was supposed to be on the cheese ( obviously not).</li><li>Truly, all of the dishes are fabulous !!!!</li><li>All the other dishes were good but they wouldnt stand out over any other mexican restaurant The decor is n't anything special, but the food was great!</li><li>The 2 main dishes we ordered were the Polo con Mole and another chicken dish with poblano peppers.</li><li>I 've tasted a wide range of the dishes that they had to offer and would not put it as the best Mexican food I 've eaten.</li><li>Salsa was n't that great, guacamole was good though, soups and other dishes definitely need more tending too.</li><li>6) We ordered 5 dishes.</li><li>We had five ravenous adults and could not finish the three dishes.</li><li>The dishes that are a must try here are the hot n sour soup, Cantonese chow mein, and the special fried rice.</li><li>Portion is huge but most of the dishes we ordered were meh to bad ...</li><li>The list that I mentioned above all together will run you around $ 35 with most of the dishes well under $ 10.</li><li>We ordered five dishes to share ( obviously I 'm not using the official chinese names): 1) Deep fried fish with cream corn- a favourite of mine.</li><li>All the other dishes I 've tried here are the same, if not better, than Congee Queen.</li><li>It was A-Ok in my book and I 'm sure they have some wonderful dishes, but I was only impressed with some of them.</li><li>When the dishes arrive ..</li><li>Sometimes some dishes are bland.</li><li>Amazing food, huge dishes.</li><li>But really, it 's fun with table-top cooked dishes because you can add things depending on what you order and they make you fried rice at the end.</li><li>Table-top cooked dishes are quite common in Korea, they are usually very cheap and easy to find in small neighbourhoods and people usually enjoy them as a meal or to eat with soju.</li><li>Requested to refill the side dishes and took them 15 mins to get the side dishes to my table.</li><li>Requested to refill the side dishes and took them 15 mins to get the side dishes to my table.</li><li>Mediocre food, portions were smaller than usually, u have to add cheese, ramen and rice cake, do n't bother getting the rice add ones We waited 30mins for our food to come and they would n't give us our side dishes until our meal came ......</li><li>We had lunch and all the dishes were tasty.</li><li>Pho Huong Trang makes some pretty lame cold rolls ( they did n't hit you with that refreshing feeling you generally get), there was no coriander in ANY of the dishes we ordered, and to add insult to injury, the green tea was barely lukewarm -- that 's just offside!</li><li>I live in an area with many sushi options and I find myself returning here because I love the laid back atmosphere, the polite service and the manner in which dishes are thoughtfully prepared.</li><li>The core dishes I always get ( pad thai and panang curry) are great, and my standards for these are high.</li><li>The first thing I noticed when I got the menu was that it stated for dine-ins, each person had to order a minimum of $ 10 ( before tax), something that I rarely in restaurants, and kind of unreasonable as most of their main dishes were actually only $ 9.99.</li><li>We tried about 6 dishes but i do n't remember all the names.</li><li>The menu is small and offers your typical curries and noodles amongst other dishes.</li><li>Will definitely be back to try some of the other dishes.</li><li>Ordered Mango Chicken and Pad Thai, both dishes were mouth watering.</li><li>On the other side, if you are a galaxy prince or princess who needs linen on your table, square dishes, detailed ingredient descriptions on every dish, repeat special of the day 5 times, disrespectful to the restaurant rules, please do your self a favour, stay away!</li><li>There was probably around 20 + dishes different choices.</li><li>Had the weekend lunch buffet for $ 12.49, limited dishes and not tasty.</li><li>I 'm gonna come back again to try some other dishes.</li><li>All of the dishes though were steaming hot when they came out, which is usually an indicator of microwaved food.</li><li>The eggplant parm and sole type dishes on the other hand were not good.</li><li>The ambiance was really good and the waiter was good at suggesting us dishes.</li><li>A lot of very basic dishes.</li><li>The service was decent and the portions of their dishes are massive.</li><li>In addition, the sauce very much resembled a can sauce that I used on one of the dishes I cooked at home.</li><li>Seafood hot pot, $ 25.99 Jajiangmyeon ( black bean noodle soup), $ 15.99 Japchae, $ 15.99 Seafood green onion pancake, about $ 15 The noodle dishes: Both noodle dishes were probably the best tasting I 've ever had.</li><li>Overall, I like the noodle dishes but did n't think they are worth the price of about $ 15 each.</li><li>We ordered the Soon tofu and Gamjatang which came with six different side dishes.</li><li>The small side dishes were delicious and a nice touch!</li><li>Side dishes: lettuce, bean sprouts, kimchii, sweet radish, kimchii flavored radish and peanuts with little dried fish The meal was good but nothing really stood out for me.</li><li>Also, in the middle of our dinner, she came and cleaned up some empty dishes.</li><li>She EVEN asked us to put the dished in the way she needed ( small dishes on top of the large one, plastic ones was separated with china dishes), making us feel that we are HER WAITRESS !!</li><li>~ $ 60 special ( that supposedly feeds 5 ..... i had a party of 3: D) consisted of:- pork belly barbeque ( generous portions; fat was able to drip off so it was n't overwhelming)- mussel soup- choice of 1 bottle of sake or 5 bottles of beer- fish stew- buckwheat noodles- the usual table full of side dishes- ( complimentary sample of assorted meats &amp; blood sausage) so. bomb.</li><li>Side dishes were better then most placeS, kimchi was well made and fresh! perfect!</li><li>They do n't have any specialties, they have everything and all the dishes I 've tried are good.</li><li>We had a group of 6 and ordered a set meal that came with noodles ( and some veggies) in soup, seafood pancake, Tangsuyuk ( Sweet, sour, and crispy pork), bulgogi in a pot where the server cooked for us, and pork bone soup, and of course several side dishes.</li><li>For less than $ 10, you can get a big bowl of tofu soup, rice, and six side dishes.</li><li>Most of the dishes we ordered either lacked of flavor or had too much tomato sauce.</li><li>She dropped several dishes and broke them, and even knocked over a table ( which was to her credit, loose) and sent a couple plates flying.</li><li>The dishes were either overly salty or incredibly bland.</li><li>Now onto the main dishes.</li><li>Along came 5 more wrappers, with, again, four tiny dishes containing scallion, celery, cucumber ( we had not finished the celery and cucumber from the first round, and wanted only scallions), and hoisin.</li><li>A lot of unique dishes on the menu.</li><li>I do n't have words to describe all the dishes, only to say they are all incredible.</li><li>The Fried Duck was also very moist and crisp, and a together with the wrap, celery, hoi sin sauce provided a multi-faceted alternative to the other mildly spicy dishes.</li><li>Still a good dish, just not as good in light of the other dishes.</li><li>The aroma of the dishes immediately fills the air.</li><li>I can tell that there was some thought put into the presentation of the dishes but the execution was not impressive.</li><li>Of the 3 dishes, I personally like the Fried Rice the best.</li><li>All of the dishes were spot on with the right taste, sweetness, and spice.</li><li>Some of the dishes we ordered came with a bowl of rice.</li><li>We also ordered the spring lamb medium rare and it was quite juicy: 3 We liked the sauce a lot but I did n't actually taste any peanut ... all the better because I do n't really like the peanut taste in salty dishes.</li><li>All the dishes were perfectly portioned for the three of us ( we did family style) and quite delicious.</li><li>First of all, after going to Thailand and tasting what amazing dishes Thai food can offer, I 've been searching for authentic Thai food all around North America.</li><li>All the dishes were delicious.</li><li>My only comment was that the dishes are presented Chinese style, meaning that each dish came out one at a time, instead of together since my friend and I ordered our own separately, so you might want to make that request.</li><li>Do n't even want to mention the other dishes I had here.</li><li>Linda 's is the sister restaurant to Salad King but even though they are under the same management, there are differences between the two such as more distinctive dishes at Linda 's instead of the fast food kind you get at Salad King and of course the price!</li><li>I 've had a few dishes here but the Cevappi is by far my favourite.</li><li>We had some of the side dishes too which were good.</li><li>It 's a deli, so of course the cold dishes are premade, and probably in large batches.</li><li>You turn left into the cafeteria and grab cold plates and order hot dishes, then pay, then grab a seat.</li><li>Overall the rice, noodle, dumpling, and bread-like dishes are very much Chinese style, but it does differ a little from mainstream Chinese cooking just to have its own unique taste.</li><li>However, I do feel that the flavours and spicing in the dishes were extremely muted perhaps our group was handed a raw deal when a few folks objected to ordering all spicy skewers.</li><li>We ordered a few dishes, all containing lamb.</li><li>Most of the dishes we had were fine, and there was nothing that blew me away.</li><li>Ordered 2 dishes.</li><li>Most of the dishes had the same spices used &amp; many of them were the kind we did n't like.</li><li>Here 's what I recommend: The spicy lamb skewers sweet and sour soup spicy mini lamb chops There are interesting dishes on the menu like Jellyfish and Oxtail so if you are feeling adventurous go for it.</li><li>My friend said the food is actually classified as Islamic, so all the dishes are lamb or beef.</li><li>I honestly will need to make more trips to see how the rest of the menu is as the portions are way too large to order multiple dishes for sampling!</li><li>Well, I gave this place 5 stars for its friendly waitresses, variety/ quality of dishes.</li><li>I definitely give this restaurant a 5/5 for the amazing dishes we tried and I cannot wait to go back to try other popular items!</li><li>The good thing about restaurant though is they have dishes from all over China, of course nothing are quite live up to the authentic standard; another good thing about this place is nothing is very spicy so it 's good for ppl who ca n't handle spicy food.</li><li>We had some issues asking for information on menu and. dishes Baa, baa, black sheep, ( Jen k and Wayne arrange for a lamb focused UYE) Have you any wool ? ( After a debate we set the date) Yes, sir, yes, sir, ( 12 Yelpers agree to partake) Three bags full; ( How we felt after the UYE) This UYE was arranged to coincide with the Year of the Ram.</li><li>I came for a UYE organized by Jennifer K. We ordered mostly lamb/goat dishes: grilled skews, curry, marinated, roasted, stir fried, spicy, not spicy.</li><li>Generally, all the dishes were boldly flavoured and the meat well-seasoned.</li><li>Basic dishes such as the cold cucumber salad was pretty sad.</li><li>The best dishes aside from the kebabs were easily the sweet and sour fried fish, which was tangy and crunchy, the lamb hand-cut noodles, and the vegetable dou miao.</li><li>We always order the same 7-8 dishes.</li><li>One of my personal favourite dishes is the beef/lamb noodle soup.</li><li>As with most AYCE places, dishes are hit and miss. Stick to the fish selections, they are better than the meats.</li><li>The dishes we ordered were just mediocre.</li><li>All the dishes I 've had there is above-average, at least for the Toronto area.</li><li>Most popular dishes include shawarma, kebab, falafel, and various middle eastern dips.</li><li>Other notable dishes are the Fatouche ( tomato, cucumber, mint, sour sumach, and toasted pita), ful bean dish, and of course the tabbouleh.</li><li>There were 5 of us so we asked our server how much food would be enough for us and she said 6lbs of lobster from couple other dishes would be enough to fill us up.</li><li>At times we had several dishes on the table at once.</li><li>The only thing that I feel could use some improvements are their side dishes.</li><li>The price of the dishes have n't changed in over a year so I guess by removing some of the frills, they were able to prevent raising the menu prices.</li><li>Overall, considering the HUGE portions for their dishes, it is certainly worth the value!</li><li>I did n't find any of the dishes overly greasy and they were all tasty.</li><li>Each side dish is rather large so two people will have more than enough to eat with two side dishes.</li><li>If you come to Congee Queen, you should really be able to sample a lot of their dishes, so you want to bring a bigger crowd.:) Every time we have a family get together, we bring everyone here because they can accommodate many for one table.</li><li>The menus are basically the same, but the dishes taste marginally better and the prices are comparable.</li><li>All the dishes were so tasty.</li><li>It 's a cheap, cheerful and plentiful chinese restaurant in the same vein as Congee Star and Asian King, offering a plentiful menu with congee, noodle dishes, barbecue, etc.</li><li>Expertly prepared Cantonese food, including congee, noodles of all sorts and Popular dishes including fried squids, bbq pork and duck.</li><li>Why not go for their `` afternoon tea'' ( 3-5pm weekdays) with a wide selection of regular dishes.</li><li>With 5 dishes and only cost us less than $ 45 is very affordable.</li><li>We ordered some vegetable dishes and tofu dishes off the featured menu.</li><li>However we finally got them to remake two of the dishes.</li><li>Overall, the dishes had really good flavor and consistency.</li><li>We ordered the following dishes: Salt and pepper squid- Lightly battered and deep fried, delicious Empress Fried Rice- Had bonito flakes, delicious BBQ duck- Roasted duck is great, delicious Fried bean curd with veggies- It seemed more like tofu to me, delicious Fried eggplant, minced and salted fish with spicy sauce- I 'm allergic to eggplant, ate it anyways, not my favourite dish but I 'll eat it I guess Fried rice noodle with beef and scrambled egg sauce- This was my favourite dish there, would 10/10 recommend eating again, delicious This place is a chain, and some places are better than other, but this one is great!</li><li>Not a good sign. one of my favorite restaurants. great price and service, top quality food. my favorite dishes are spice and pepper squid, fried turnips, tiger shrimp congee, and the roasted pork.</li><li>Not sure if it was the combination of the dishes we ordered ( the turnip patties were phenomenal) or the great value ( $ 36 for the whole meal incl. tip, which could 've fed 4-5 people easy), but we left very satisfied customers.</li><li>The dishes come fast because they have a simple menu that looks more complex than meets the eye.</li><li>The dishes are really standard vegetable, rice, noodles, and congee with a different spin so avoid ordering two similar dishes or you may find them tasting similar.</li><li>We ordered 4 dishes for two people.</li><li>Quick service, large portions, tasty dishes ( MSG) and cheap prices!</li><li>A friend of mine dropped by for lunch and I recommended them as the food is tasty especially when eaten in the restaurant ( normally I used take out) We ordered 3 dishes and a couple rice bowls.</li><li>They will help you get to know the real good dishes that you may not have the guys to try.</li><li>The most important thing to know is that unlike in a typical Western restaurant, you order the dishes that will be shared between all the people at your table.</li><li>Other interesting thing is that between three people we payed around $ 40 for 4 dishes.</li><li>Those were totally solid, however the lacklustre dishes above totally overshadowed them.</li><li>Food is typical Asian fare although their menu indicates they have `` new taste'' section where some of the traditional dishes are experimental with some ingredients.</li><li>I think the size of the dishes are average.</li><li>Lots of choices from Congee, to main dishes, noodles, snacks almost anything Cantonese ( they have pho and pad thai too!) that you can think of.</li><li>Some of my favourite small dishes here include the `` Yian Shu Jie/Yeem So Gai'' ( salty fried chicken) and the Taiwanese sausages.</li><li>A word of warning for both these dishes though, they are only good if you sit there and eat it when it 's scalding hot.</li><li>They also have a variety of `` tea-flavoured'' dishes- but I do n't actually ever taste the tea flavour in them.</li><li>With side dishes and rice rounding out the meal, we were very satisfied; the portions were generous but not overly so.</li><li>Not even the side dishes.</li><li>We ordered kimchi jjigae ( kimchi soup), toboki and Kamja tang ( pork bone soup) Toboki is sweeter here not that spicy but still pretty good The portion here are smaller, and they only provide four side dishes.</li><li>The flavour for both dishes were very sweet so half way through it got too much to finish.</li><li>We were given cold side dishes that consisted of Kimchi, broccoli with hot sauce, pickled radish ?, and mashed potatoes.</li><li>The cheapness of the dishes should have been a reflection of the food and we should have stayed away, however it was because it was all so cheaply priced that we did n't feel that ripped off walking out of.</li><li>I 'll admit, I like their table cooking selections ( I personally go for the chicken one) and along with that I always add a few side dishes to add to it.</li><li>Water was quick, but everything else including side dishes took forever.</li><li>Prior to our Seafood DakGalbee, side dishes were served.</li><li>I just fear for the servers ' safety when they cook the noodles since the equipment they use to cook the dishes look a bit archaic. i used to go to the one in downtown and this time i thought i will give their yonge location a try !! ordered the chicken dakgalbee with their original joons sauce. and always its a must to add on cheese, ramen and ricecake !!! ( MY FAVVVV !!!) it was a little different as the dakgalbee was now cooked by a staff and brought to you instead of it being cooked right in front of you !! ( there was a little area on one side of the restaurant where a staff is cooking all the dakgalbee orders). i didnt like that as i enjoyed taking part in the cooking process and watching it cooked right in front of me !! the portions did seem smaller and the ramen ended up being overcooked. everything else was ok. maybe its just me but i find the downtown location tasted better!</li><li>Side dishes are standard of kimchi, bean sprouts, turnip and mashed potato.</li><li>Than we will be fully stuffed up to our necks:) the side dishes are not bad either.</li><li>There were only four side dishes ( kimchi, sweet potato mash, seaweed salad, pickled carrots and radish), and each came in tiny portions.</li><li>I only got 2 dishes!</li><li>Both of us were very full and satisfied with the dishes.</li><li>I would order this again all the time, as it is a great fresh side dish that pairs well against the heavy, spicy, noodle dishes.</li><li>Mid China authentic dishes.</li><li>Both these dishes here were great!</li><li>Around 12:20, we still had n't received the tossed cucumber nor sliced beef ( cold) appetizers yet and we noticed that this same table that had ordered their dishes at noon just received both of their appetizers.</li><li>They need someone to be pre-making these noodles ahead of time so that they can save time and bring out the dishes.</li><li>Definitely reminded me of some of the dishes I had when I was in Xi' an a few years ago.</li><li>Calling ahead is a good idea, although they 're pretty quick about putting together dishes to order.</li><li>Most dishes were spicy and quite oily but that 's comfort food for ya.</li><li>The special part of the dishes were the noodles were different.</li><li>The dishes served here are from the north-western part of China around the city of Xi' an.</li><li>I 'm fortunate that my wife usually picks good dishes to eat.</li><li>I especially love the dimsum-esque food they have, but their vegetable dishes are also pretty good.</li><li>None of the dishes are done exceptionally well but at least the level of quality is consistent across the menu.</li><li>Our food came in an ok amount of time, but one of our dishes was stone cold, so we asked for it to be heated up.</li><li>I have n't tried too many of the dishes but others have told me the same.</li><li>I ordered angel hair pasta with mussels, a whole bunch of other side dishes.</li><li>We ordered a few other dishes like fried fish in sweet and sour sauce and deep fried pork chop which was average at best was a little too salty and slightly overcooked.</li><li>My friends tell me that they have been open for a long long time, so their dishes must be legit!</li><li>We also ordered a few more dishes.</li><li>These dishes are not why we go back, but here again the quality is even year after year.</li><li>Little did we know that the take-out menu was more extensive and had more authentic dishes !!!</li><li>Then, we had an assortment of dishes including fried pork cutlets, fried green beans, tofu, beef and onion, Chicken with sprinkled garlic and for me, vegetarian dumplings ( but no meat).</li><li>I will give it 4 stars for the Peking Duck but only 2 stars for the rest of the dishes.</li><li>On top of that, it was n't busy but not once did anyone come by to clear the dishes, asked if we wanted refills, or checked to see if everything was alright.</li><li>Other dishes I 've had here are authentic and on par with most of the better Chinese places in the city.</li><li>Honestly my knowledge in Chinese food is below average so most of the time other people order and I just eat so I do n't know what the dishes are called.</li><li>Then there were other dishes, Fried rice, was grease and cold, Chinese broccoli was good ( But how can you go wrong with the most simple dish) but COLD!</li><li>Both of them were fine ( neither got sick) and really liked their dishes.</li><li>Good menu selection as well with dishes in the $ 10 ~ $ 15 range, I love that they have a brunch menu for the weekends!</li><li>They have amazing authentic dishes for reasonable prices.</li><li>The other dishes at the table were a pesto pasta, tuscan fries, &amp;, portobello piadini.</li><li>Not the best Korean food I 've had but the portions are large and the side dishes are plentiful.</li><li>The meat quality is pretty good, and they allow multiple refills on the side dishes.</li><li>Overall a great place for some legit Korean food =) Very delicious, great value, excellent side dishes and a ton of variety on the menu.</li><li>They 're really generous with the side dishes.</li><li>I got about 9 side dishes ( including a choice pancake!) to start and then a piping hot bowl of soup with a side of purple rice.</li><li>I 'm sad to report that the main dishes were disappointing across the board.</li><li>I could stand that they ignore you when they are busy, or you stop getting teas or they just stop refilling your side dishes.</li><li>They have 8 side dishes!</li><li>A couple of positives of this restaurant is price is n't too bad, good variety of side dishes, open late and a lot of dishes to choose from.</li><li>The owners are friendly and you get many side dishes ( which rotate) and a green pancake ( I could get full from the amount of side dishes there are).</li><li>Overall, cute little restaurant with a lot of yummy side dishes and little Korean ladies who can speak more than just Korean.</li><li>They have 8 side dishes and they are all very good!</li><li>The best thing about Oh Geul Boh Geul is the banchan/free side dishes.</li><li>They offer more varieties of these little dishes than most: a salty dish of greens, bean sprouts, kimchi, chap chae/clear glass noodles, a pickled and spicy cucumber, a whole pancake the size of your hand, plus more.</li><li>By the way, their side dishes are awesome.</li><li>I love the side dishes especially the potato pancake.</li><li>Great small free dishes.</li><li>The menu is in both Korean and English, explaining what the dishes are.</li><li>My personal favourite dishes are the bi bim bap and the black bean noodles.</li><li>They give you a lot of delicious side dishes and they have many different type of soups on their menu.</li><li>They served a good number of side dishes to enjoy along with the main dish.</li><li>The quality of the main dishes and the service that came with it were passable.</li><li>Lots of variety for side dishes.</li><li>But they make up for it with the side dishes!</li><li>I do get full from just eating the side dishes.</li><li>I basically pointed at the picture on the menu and before I knew it there was14 different dishes on the table ( refer to picture and you will see what I mean).</li><li>For $ 45 the meal came with the beef sirloin, two bowls of purple rice, lettuce wrap, seasoned lettuce, onion pancake, an assortment of 8 side dishes and a bowl of seafood soon tofu soup.</li><li>One of the best parts is that they have many side dishes- one of them is even a kimchi pancake!</li><li>Firstly, this place has amazing ban-chan ( side dishes).</li><li>We had 6 decently flavoured side dishes served to us before our meal came to us.</li><li>Tons of great side dishes!</li><li>Love the many side dishes they offer and the food is never a dissapointment!</li><li>The one thing that keeps me coming back to Oh Geul Boh Geul is the wide variety of side dishes.</li><li>Their usual assortment of banchan consists of 10 different side dishes- Kimchi, bean sprouts, tofu, chap chae, seaweed salad, and they switch up the remaining.</li><li>Sometimes it 's potato side dishes, kimchi cucumbers/radish, and/or peanuts with anchovies.</li><li>Yes, it tastes delicious, but what makes it super awesome is the fact that it 's part of the free side dishes!</li><li>So, 4 star rating for the fact that I can get my fill pretty much solely on the 10 side dishes.</li><li>Sadly, I believe they 've changed their refill policy so that you can only get a refill of 3 side dishes.</li><li>So now that I 've finished my ranting and raving about the side dishes ( namely the pancake), onwards with a review of the actual food from the menu, pricing and service.</li><li>One of the reason Korean food is awesome, all the free side dishes ( banchan).</li><li>Really wish we got some rice for these following 3 dishes, they are definitely meant to eaten with rice LA Ribs- Kalbi ( Short Ribs) ~ Love kalbi, always perfectly marinated with the perfect amount of fat.</li><li>Love the many side dishes they offer, especially the pancake !!!</li><li>We encountered no trouble when asking for a second helping of the side dishes and the ladies were nice to us overall.</li><li>Ordered 3 dishes being the dumpling and rice cake in egg drop soup which was really tasty but a little lacking in beef and too full of rice cakes.</li><li>Usually at other Korean restaurants from previous experiences, side dishes come fairly quick after you order.</li><li>We WAITED OVER 30 MINS to get side dishes and after another 10 mins, we got our pork bone soup.</li><li>As we were waiting for other food to come, we finished some of the side dishes and wanted refills, the server was n't too friendly when we asked and told us you can ONLY choose 3 to refill.</li><li>I 've NEVER been to any other restaurant that limits how much you refill side dishes.</li><li>Apparently as I read reviews from fellow Yelpers, they also give you a free pancake with your side dishes, which we NEVER got! = ( When we got all our foods, we had to wait for rice, which took another 5 mins for the server to bring to us.</li><li>Fantastic stuff, along with the 7-8 side dishes that no other korean restaurant on yonge st. can match.</li><li>It was my first time trying it yet I fell in love with the broth instantly, it came in a generous portion and all the lunch specials came with Korean black rice ( or purple rather) and ban chan ( side dishes).</li><li>I 'm fairly happy when a Korean restaurant gives me 7 banchan ( side dishes).</li><li>Had I not ordered food, I think the side dishes would have made for a good light dinner.</li><li>Many apps/side dishes including a pancake that 's pretty nice.</li><li>The food is n't particularly good but they have a whole bunch of side dishes.</li><li>FOOD: As my friend said, there are indeed a record number of banchans served: you get 10 different side dishes!</li><li>So many good side dishes! ( Especially the potato pancake ~) Whenever I go there, it 's always busy though ...</li><li>They are very generous with the side dishes and a fruit for dessert.</li><li>In my most recent visit, there were a couple of new side dishes I received but still, the total was about 9 so they must have about 12 different sides in their rotation.</li><li>Where are my side dishes and water ?</li><li>How rude you should be to not bring side dishes and water ?</li><li>We got 2 dishes of appetizers with that.</li><li>And I like their side dishes.</li><li>Maybe it was the waitress that could n't get our simple order down because other tables that came after us already got their dishes.</li><li>With most food groups) ... you can go across the street to M2M and get some Korean side dishes and maybe some type of bun or roll to get with the chicken.</li><li>There 's a fair bit of heat with the dishes ( I 'm very tolerant), the biryani is rich with flavours with plenty of herbs and spices.</li><li>The Peking Duck wasokay- the usual side dishes and garnishes were missing but the duck was well roasted.</li><li>We had several dishes and most of them were good.</li><li>Ultimately, I know Willy 's can AND HAS served better dishes, so do yourself a favor and restrict your cheap-eat-chowdowns to the `` special lunch deal'' hours of 11 to 1pm weekdays.</li><li>Bests: Vancouver Ribs were pretty good Worst: Truly terrible `` bbq pork ends'' were not as one would imagine ( ie- chewy sweet sticky end cuts of bbq pork) but rather just diced cubes of pale, tasteless white pork, and most other dishes were also flavorless and disappointing, including the chicken-bacon sticks people rave about!</li><li>Fav dishes: aforementioned Yaka Mein, steamed pork, sesame/butterfly shrimp, lobster sauce ( order it as a side without the shrimp to save a bit of $ $), Chinese sausage fried rice.</li><li>I like that Pastel puts in effort to make their dishes look good.</li><li>The menu was accompanied by a book of pictures showcasing all of their dishes.</li><li>Their dishes are amazing and well laid out.</li><li>Their best dishes for me are the crepes, waffles, and green tea shaved ice cream.</li><li>None of the dishes were good!</li><li>The dishes are always made perfectly and fills you up no matter what.</li><li>You can get pho for $ 8 and most of the dishes are $ 10 or under.</li><li>I went two more times after my first visit and the quality of food has deteriorated a bit, the pho now tastes ok and also other dishes are ok.</li><li>We were a group of around 15 and arrived around 8 to a table set with about 40 dishes of shrimp cocktail, pickled herring, large plates of smoked salmon, beet salad, chicken pates, caesar salad, caviar and mini-pancakes, and much, much more.</li><li>The food was good but I 'd agree that the appetizers were better than the mains, although I did n't eat many mains because I was full of the early dishes.</li><li>Non-sushi dishes ( e.g. any sort of soup based item or udon) are hit-or-miss, but more of a miss. Green tea ice cream is a nice touch.</li><li>Shortly after ordering received side salad and miso soup no Korean side dishes.</li><li>It tasted bland and barely any seafood also skipping on Korean side dishes.</li><li>Price is high but so is the quality, keeping in mind this is a buffet, and you should never take the last spoonful of anything from a nearly empty tray, and focus on the freshly-filled dishes.</li><li>As always, the dishes at my table piled up while my server continued to walk around the dining area and collect dishes from other tables, I had to flag him down and tell him to take my dishes away.</li><li>Service was very good, all of our dishes were removed the moment we finished, and our tea was always full.</li><li>Another waitress came to refill ALL our side dishes and the other waitress was sent to other tables.</li><li>Ordered the famous Eggs Natasha with a side of sausage and the Smoked Salmon Rosti, both of which were pretty good, and also very creative dishes that I have n't encountered anywhere else.</li><li>No heaping, greasy, messy breakfasts here, only sophisticated, flavourful dishes with some flair.</li><li>All dishes were successful according to my taste buds!</li><li>Though I 've had the `` Bibimbap'', I usually go with the `` Broiled/Fried Bulgogi''- both these dishes were pretty standard, compared to other Korean places.</li><li>It also came with some side dishes.</li><li>Since we had so many people, I do not think they served it in the same dishes that were in the photos which is a shame since it looked quite authentic.</li><li>Just 10 dollars for a soup, rice and side dishes.</li><li>They give a lot of side dishes- which are all delicious.For all the soup dishes, they give you purple rice, which is quite a bit as well.</li><li>They also provide you with a raw egg which you crack in, and side dishes of course.</li><li>My favourite is the Bulgogi soup which contains a yummy broth that has the right amount of sweetness and clear jap chae noodles that has an amazing texture, served with the usual obligatory Korean side dishes and purple rice.</li><li>Delicious tofu soup + yummy side dishes + generous portions = me, happy as a clam.</li><li>Before your meal they bring out tasty small dishes of kimchi, bean sprouts and other items to share.</li><li>Soup is served literally boiling over and their side dishes were maybe not as plentiful in variety but very tasty.</li><li>What we had: Kimchi soup, dumpling soup, and vegetable soup ( all soups come with a bowl of purple rice and shared side dishes) Taste: 6/10 They give you a little raw egg to crack into your soup, which is a nice touch.</li><li>They do n't have a large variety of side dishes; there was bean sprouts, tiny little beans, and two other dishes.</li><li>They also only serve the exact same 4 banchan ( side dishes) each time.</li><li>Soup, tofu, raw egg ( it cooks in the hot broth), kimchi, meat, rice and a few side dishes.</li><li>Our dishes were served limited banchans but two of were already my usual favorites- bean sprouts and black beans.</li><li>They brought out the side dishes ( beans, sprouts, kimchi and radish).</li><li>The side dishes were average, I still prefer Joons or Oh Geul Boh Geuls side dishes but moving on, the menu was fairly simple it had variations of soon tofu, bulgogi and bibimbap.</li><li>The other dishes here are limited ( 10 ?) but all are quality and tasty.</li><li>Many of their dishes round to $ 10 including tax.</li><li>Overall, tofu is good, side dishes are poor and not sure if it 's hygienic, service is very poor, I 'm disappointed.</li><li>Just as good as the first time The best part is the side dishes ( soy beans, bean sprouts, radish and kimchii) They have my favorite side dishes and no problem asking for seconds or even thirds if you 're not too embarrassed to ask that is The menu is small and concise, which is perfect because I prefer it over a lengthy menu.</li><li>Their best dishes are the soon tofu soups.</li><li>Before my order arrived, my friend and I were served some nice tea and a few side dishes.</li><li>They serve simple dishes that are piping hot and delicious.</li><li>Their menu is small, only 2 pages with one page full of a variety of tofu stews and some other traditional korean dishes.</li><li>My go-to dishes are the kimchi soon tofu and the bulgogi.</li><li>Love the seafood flavor of the spicy broth and all the side dishes.</li><li>Their menu is small but that just means they are specialized in a certain number of dishes.</li><li>Not only do you get the soup that fills your tummy with superpowers ( hell yeah), but you get a big bowl of rice and unlimited side dishes! unlimited !? yes.* great place to meet a friend that you have n't seen for awhile* hell, eat solo there too, plenty of seats ... but expect to wait a bit during the supper time 6-8:30pm ? roughly. waiting time is no more than 15 mins max cheers and enjoy! if you 're 3 or more, order the sizzling bulgogi on the hot plate to share !! when you have something that sizzles, you ca n't go wrong.</li><li>At first it was just one, trying to land on our side dishes, then more and more came, to the point were we had to stop our conversation or eating to wave them away.</li><li>They all come with hot stone pot rice and side dishes.</li><li>Usually ban chan are complimentary side dishes that always given with your meal at Korean restaurants.</li><li>The place speciality is their tofu based Korean dish their other dishes are also a must try, the place is over all welcoming and will unquestionably give you taste of Korea while making Koreans nostalgic for a meal from home.</li><li>Plus you get your regular array of side dishes.</li><li>Although their rice is consistently good, their side dishes are getting worse and worse.</li><li>Side dishes are delicious but do n't offer a lot of variety.</li><li>You can choose how spicy you want your soon tofu and the side dishes are very tasty.</li><li>Options are limited to a few dishes but bibimbap will always stand out for me.</li><li>Plus it comes with this korean rice and several side dishes.</li><li>Nevertheless, I enjoyed my meal and came out reaaaally full esp. with all the side dishes.</li><li>Portion size is perfect + it comes with delicious side dishes.</li><li>The soup tastes average, toppings: poor, side dishes: average, service: not great, meh Is n't worth the money, not even eight bucks.</li><li>Overall I thought the flavor was slightly bland and there are not enough side dishes.</li><li>Food came out at a good pace and all the cooked dishes were hot.</li><li>The wait between dishes took quite a bit longer than most AYCE buffets I 've been to.</li><li>The server hands you a few order sheets, and you mark down the quantity of each item desired, whether it 's sushi, appetizers, soups, noodles, hot dishes, etc., and they make everything to order.</li><li>This was nice as it let me try a variety of different dishes and appetizers.</li><li>When you are done, you leave your dirty dishes at the table, you tell the cashier what you had and pay on your way out.</li><li>The same Rosti dishes, pastas, meat grilling station doing the same thing and fish fillet cooked the same boring way, not sure if a few pseudo Asian fusion-y dishes are meant to jazz things up, certainly not kicking up the excitement level for me.</li><li>My fiancé, his brother and father in law all enjoyed their dishes.</li><li>Alongside the soup they provide a small dishes of rice and three different types of kimchi that accompany the meal, all of which were really tasty.</li><li>Also the portion is smaller than other places ( usually 2 bones instead of the standard 3 +) and they only give about 4 side dishes.</li><li>The mixture of flavors make for spectacular dishes!</li><li>It comes with a bowl of rice and you also get the obligatory side dishes which tend to come with any Korean meal.</li><li>One of the ladies I used to see all the time at the night shift would comment on how nice my makeup was, the other young man working there would give my Dad and I extra side dishes when we needed more, and the old tall young man would joke about how us Canadians are so polite.</li><li>The walls are covered with photos of their dishes, which is actually quite helpful when trying to decide what to order.</li><li>You do n't really come here for the ambiance, but for 2 main dishes: ( i) pork bone soup and ( ii) LA galbi ribs.</li><li>The kicker is that the delicious little side dishes are unlimited, so we had tons of picked cucumbers, spicy potatoes, bean sprouts and kimchi.</li><li>I remember it used to be 6.95 per dish and now it 's about 9.99 for most of the dishes.</li><li>Other notable dishes include the kalbi ( korean short ribs), sweet and spicy fried chicken as well as the sweet and spicy squid.</li><li>Even the dishes were falling apart.</li><li>They have a small selection of side dishes ( This is why I come to Korean restaurants, side dishes !!!)</li><li>I still ate it however i did add a lot of salt in the soup so that helped somewhat. the service i would give a 2.5/5 because the employees do n't respond to you, even if you wave down a waiter they 'll just ignore you. i did find my bf 's bulgogi dish appetizing, along with the kimchi. although my gom tang was n't as expected, i will probably be back here on a random night craving for some korean food. i am pretty sure there are better dishes they have to offer. pretty convenient that there 's a private parking lot. ( that 's a plus for me bc we hate looking for parking and paying the ticket in general) Among my friends I 'm probably the only one who really really likes this place.</li><li>Their portions are great and the traditional Korean side dishes are really yummy, which they refill when I quickly finish some lol Of course i order my `` GamJaTang'', table cooking style and it was a good portion and yummy!</li><li>The only thing I would want to see more of are more varieties of side dishes.</li><li>I 've been to other korean restaurants and they have more and better side dishes to offer.</li><li>I am not a fan of the loud Korean pop music, the tap water served in aged plastic bottles, the sticky tables and the heavy use of oil in pretty much all their dishes.</li><li>Kimchi and other side dishes were n't so great.</li><li>We were quite satisfied and will be back to try some other dishes.</li><li>However, not all dishes here are great, so you should try to stick to their specialties.</li><li>The menu had a good selection of dishes, with the hot dishes clearly identified for people ( like myself) that are not overly familiar with Vietnamese cuisine.</li><li>They did this with all employees, so customers beware! portions here are really generous. the workers and waitresses are also really nice. for the people who are complaining about how the workers are ( ie rolliing the dirty dishes around etc) ... thats typically a normal vietnamese resturant for you. if u think this is dirty then u should not go to vietnam lol. but anywho, food here is really good. my parents go here every other day or so cos its close to their work and i also know a friend who eats here everyday too just cause he loves it. the pho, rice, and bun mam is really yummy. also my aunt is obssessed with their viet coffee as she says its authentic since there is so much flavour! also really cheap too:) oh yeah its cash only ... i think by now its safe to say if u go anywhere asian, just have cash with u cos chances are they are not going to take debit or credit!</li><li>Every time I come here there is two dishes I must get.</li><li>We will try something different every time, but we almost always order these dishes:- Glutinous rice roll with Chinese donuts and meat floss fillings- Wonton in in spicy peanut sauce- Rolled onion cake with slices of beef- Dan Dan noodles in spicy peanut sauce- for dessert, my MIL loves the deep fried Chinese donuts with red bean paste filling.</li><li>Dumplings here are good, not as good as the one on Yonge street but other dishes here are better compared to over there.</li><li>Order food you can recognize and it will be good, We like the dim sum, hot and sour soup, cream of corn soup, shrimp dishes, beef dishes, and noodles, My friend and I were at the Ravel location.</li><li>We ordered several dishes.</li><li>We came for lunch and ordered a variety of dishes including: green onion pancakes- thin, crispy, delicious Chive pockets- thin, crispy dough as well.</li><li>Had some other dishes too, but the one to focus on is the Peking Duck.</li><li>I liked how their menu included pictures so none chinese folks can have a glimps of what some of the dishes look like ( ones we got loomed identical to the photos) I took one star away due to their poor service.</li><li>Do n't try other dishes like stirring fried vermicelli ( poor portion and bland, for all the Cantonese dishes, I recommend congee Wong nearby) or traditional Chinese dishes like fish flavoured pork slices ( 鱼香肉丝 ）, sweat &amp; sour fish is a big joke ... check out my photos--it 's even a joke for the Westerners, okay ?</li><li>We ca n't get beyond ordering these 2 dishes because they never disappoint.</li><li>He was the Panino Cappucino version of that chef in the movie `` Last Vacation''- taking pride in every dish, eager to inspire our palates with fresh &amp; authentic dishes he encouraged us to indulge, happy to help us along our foodie journey through unexplored Italian territory !!</li><li>And the side dishes are unlimited.</li><li>One of the positive things is the various amount of small dishes of foods that they give you ... 10 foods!</li><li>But they give many side dishes and food are actually pretty nice.</li><li>Most dishes are less than $ 10 and you get a bounty of complimentary side dishes along with your meal.</li><li>Most dishes are less than $ 10 and you get a bounty of complimentary side dishes along with your meal.</li><li>Pork bone soup was alright, although it 's quality was worse than I remembered from a couple months ago, and there were less side dishes than before.</li><li>I really enjoyed the side dishes, which had a really great variety, but kind of small servings.</li><li>Me and my friend simply made a request for a side-dish refill- and asked again as we have not seen in for quiet sometime- and the server simply yelled at us `` It 's coming!'' and the server who brought our side dishes were grumbling in Korean which we did not understand.</li><li>And some other dishes are also quite nice.</li><li>In addition to fast and usually friendly service ( there have been times where they are super busy and its more efficient than friendy), they have awesome side dishes!</li><li>We had 5 people and ordered 4 dishes to share, but apparent by their standard, that was not good enough for them.</li><li>I would rate it 1-star, but the quality of the side dishes and the actual bibimbap earned them an extra star.</li><li>8 dishes!</li><li>I could n't believe it ... 8 small dishes of banchan: Kimchi, glazed soybeans ( my absolute fav.), seaweed, japchae, odeng strips, bean sprouts, glazed sweet potato and pickled daikon.</li><li>Overall, it was alright but next time, I 'm going to order their popular dishes.</li><li>Pros:- Location is very accessible by TCC ( on Yonge, just south of Finch Station)- The variety of those little side dishes is astounding!</li><li>Generous amounts of glass noodles, kimchi, potato, bean sprout, seaweed salad, and a variety of other cold dishes that are all more tasty than the main course itself.</li><li>Side dishes are the only thing that keeps me coming back.</li><li>The dishes are amazing.</li><li>The other dishes are mediocre and sometimes I am not sure why I find myself back here.It may be the fact that it 's so close to the subway station.</li><li>But I am willing to walk a mile just to have better food! 7/15 I had always wanted to check this place out after I saw the neat looking plastic food models for some of the dishes displayed on window; a common practice which is mostly seen at many Japanese restaurants.</li><li>Our food did get brought out at a reasonable pace and the dishes looked good enough.</li><li>Personally, I think the side dishes are the best amongst all the Korean restaurants at yonge and finch area.</li><li>With the side dishes, you should be quite full with ordering one item.</li><li>For the side dishes the potatoes with honey is always a hit, but with a party of 6 they only gave us 4 potatoes and expected us to share.</li><li>My favorite is by far the pork bone soup, it spicy and goes really well with the rice that they give you and the side dishes of bean sprouts, fish curd, kimchi, and seaweed.</li><li>I realized they forgot to bring us side dishes.</li><li>So we had to ask for the side dishes, too.</li><li>We asked her to check on our order and for a refill of the side dishes because we were starving.</li><li>She brings out more side dishes and practically throws them down on the table, two at a time.</li><li>TL; DR:- waited 30 minutes for food that never came- had to ask for menus, tea, and side dishes on three separate occasions- rude and passive aggressive waitress who said, and I quote, `` what do you need ?''- incompetent manager who made poor excuses rather than admitting mistakes- turned a loyal customer into an frustrated Yelp reviewer in one night Good yuk-kae-jang.</li><li>The Food is amazing I 've gotten so many dishes there ...</li><li>Food: 4/5 stars- 10 side dishes AND honey potatoes- They have a split platter of Dukboki ( Korean spicy rice cake) and Bulgogi ( grilled marinated beef) which is great to share!</li><li>I remember liking Nak Won, mainly for its large variety of side dishes.</li><li>I have to say that the side dishes were my favourite part of the meal.</li><li>With every meal, you get TEN, yes TEN, side dishes with your order.</li><li>They always give you 6 or so side dishes, soy beans, kimchee, sprouts, sweet soy potatoes, and some other varieties.</li><li>There are at least 6-8 side dishes at dinner time!</li><li>This is my go-to comfort food now.:) I came here once before and today for the second time, but I do n't recall getting side dishes.</li><li>It comes with white rice and complimentary side dishes ( jap chae, potato, sweet beans, lettuce, seawood, pieces of fish, kimchi and bean sprout).</li><li>Other dishes are very decent too.</li><li>Usually, the waiting time for the mains feels reduced by at least fast service for the side dishes.</li><li>The price is very reasonable and they give generous amount of side dishes.</li><li>Side dishes are not quite as tasty as they used to be.</li><li>I was told by one waitress that we cant get cold dishes refilled because we only ordered one main dish.</li><li>The service I can do without. terrible service. waitress gives attitude when asked for water and side dishes.</li><li>The dishes are inexpensive and the food is tasty.</li><li>Use to be a regular here but prices have gone up and the side dishes have had less items be available over the years.</li><li>I come here often and have tried a number of their dishes.</li><li>Almost all of their dishes are better than those in other Korean restaurants around the area. pork bone soup, tofu soondubu soup, beef sullungtang soup, and bibimbap are all soooo good.</li><li>Their side dishes are some of the best side dishes in a korean restaurant, I love the jap chae, seaweed, beans and potatoes!</li><li>Their other dishes are also pretty yummy!</li><li>Food: I had the short ribs egg drop soup which also comes with a bowl of rice and some complementary cold side dishes.</li><li>Overall I find both my soup and the side dishes to be really good, which adds some point for the restaurant.</li><li>Even though the soup bowls we ordered are around $ 10 I did find some of the other dishes quite pricey, especially the bbq items, where one serving of raw meats are already above $ 10.</li><li>The cooks had to consult each other on how to prepare the various dishes.</li><li>Our server had a sense of humour and was willing to guide our lunch choices based on preferences for dry/wet dishes and a good balance of flavours.</li><li>Both dishes were huge and we could n't finish them.</li><li>This is the first time I 've seen barg made of veal and I was surprised that many dishes on the menu were also veal.</li><li>The other dishes were done well too and we left pretty happy.</li><li>The restaurant overall does n't deserve more than 3 stars, but the fact that they have cooked some of the dishes with great consistency for over 10 years is appreciable.</li><li>That said, if you come alone, one or two dishes will be more than enough to fill you and you will find yourself bringing home enough leftovers for another small meal.</li><li>The taste of the dishes was pretty good but oily.</li><li>Observed other dishes which looked very good.</li><li>My pictures contain mini reviews of the dishes.</li><li>Misses- tuna sushi was not fresh, tempura was tasteless and not crisp, Agedashi tofu no flavour, beef teriyaki tough to chew and low grade cut ( round steak), portion sizes for the cooked dishes are small and about half the size of what 's typical.</li><li>I give it a 3 because some of the dishes are not consistent.</li><li>I guess their chef left and they just serve the dishes that all other Chinese restaurant serves.</li><li>Deep fried mushrooms and pumpkin with salt is a favourite of mine, but the staple dishes are average.</li><li>Prices drop for a few hours, but so does the food quality: dishes will normally arrive cold.</li><li>We had some really tasty food yet standard chinese dishes.</li><li>I ordered the Singapore noodles with chicken and a few other dishes.</li><li>Favourite dishes to order spicy crab, spicy shrimp and Vegetable rice.</li><li>A large variety of dishes can be had at the Teppanyaki grill.</li><li>We only ordered 3 dishes, with one being a spicy beef salad.</li><li>My mouth is salivating by this time, so anxious to tear into by spicy beef salad ... and then we open the bag and start puling out the dishes.</li><li>I hope to return here and try out their savory dishes.</li><li>The calamari was extremely chewy and would come off the breading ( some people like that I for one did n't) What was good was the spinach dip and seafood pasta and I 'm sure there might be other good dishes there.</li><li>The food as pretty good but we did n't find it exceptional considering it costs a bit more than other places A small, solid-to-good, Korean place with a few less-common dishes.</li><li>They have great side dishes and really good kimchi here too!</li><li>The other dishes are so yummy I think it 's worth the splurge when you 're sick of the same old mass-produced Korean dishes.</li><li>Ordered a whole bunch of food to share including: 1) Pork Bone Soup- $ 9.99 2) Samgyeopsal- BBQ Bacon and soup ( for 2 ppl)- $ 32.99 3) &amp; 4) Bibimbap- $ ?? 5) Side dishes- Free 1) Pork bone soup is really good, the consistency of the soup is slightly thicker than what you would get from any other place.</li><li>5) Side dishes are really good and I think they make these themselves.</li><li>We ordered 4 dishes, the special sweet and sour pork, beef with vegetables, chicken with vegetables, and mushrooms with vegetables.</li><li>The latter 3 dishes all had the same vegetables, just different main ingredient.</li><li>Tried a variety of dishes including shrimp dumplings, shrimp rolls, rice noodle rolls, and deep fried tofu.</li><li>You can count on them to be pretty consistent with their dishes.</li><li>The names of some of their dishes are very straightforward, as in they 're literally what they give you.</li><li>Some dishes were resting on top of other plates!</li><li>The entrees come with a plethora of side dishes and starters.</li><li>Always friendly service and well executed dishes in a dated but comfortable environment, this place will be missed ( especially the pickles).</li><li>3 of our members wanted to get the holiday dinner special where you get half of a lobster with 5 other dishes.</li><li>Some memorable dishes for me:- the blanched SPINACH SALAD starter- super palate cleansing- SASHIMI NIGIRI- did n't check/could n't figure out what fish these were, but so buttery fresh. rice was very appropriately sized to the fish portion- SASHIMI LETTUCE ROLLS- seeing shredded lettuce wrapped within my sashimi felt weird to me, but it did help pick up some extra of the ponzu-type dressing so that it was adequately saucy- BAKED OYSTER- diced and baked with a cream sauce, topped with cheese and baked in the giant shell.</li><li>The servers are n't very attentive or dare i say, sloppy at taking orders or just dumping dishes on your tables with a lack of mannerism.</li><li>The dishes are obviously not being washed properly.- my potatoes were extremely dry.</li><li>( BTW ... the crab that is offered on a couple of the dishes is canned.</li><li>The lamb is exquisite, as are most of their dishes.</li><li>The Side dishes they offer are not bad either, I liked the tofu and potatoes they give.</li><li>With this meal, we also got two soups, rice, and all the korean side dishes.</li><li>The server was friendly in the beginning, coming back with side dishes and water.</li><li>Food is very average, there 's nothing wrong with it except there 's been a few times here when it tasted like the dishes were n't as fresh.</li><li>All were quite good, but I was pleased to see the side dishes arrive!</li><li>When it was time to pay, they over charged me on BOTH dishes by a few dollars.</li><li>Our side dishes and salad came of which I was not overly impressed with and after picking at random things, decided to leave the lot of them.</li><li>There 's also a Chinese style buffet with familiar dishes, fresh fruit, jello, dim sum, dessert squares, a chocolate fountain and ice cream.</li><li>When we would get up to get the next plate, the dishes would be left on our table.</li><li>Obviously no apologies, he gave me a dirty look and picked up our dishes almost dropping them on us.</li><li>Empty dishes were quickly cleared.</li><li>Their dishes are great, everything is great.</li><li>We got a bowl of congee ( their signature item), fried vermicelli with meat, and 2 side dishes, and 2 deserts !!</li><li>Generous portions, tasty dishes, very reasonable prices for the amount and quality of food being served.</li><li>All the dishes lived up to the expectations, they were very satisfying.</li><li>The other dishes were mediocre but I think its also that we did not know WHAT to order.</li><li>However, they should clean the pots better between dishes ( I 've found items that were not part of my order presumably remenant from the previous order).</li><li>Most of the dishes are very well made versions of the standard chinese fare found in Markham.</li><li>Overall: Bottom line is that this place serves it 's purpose as a Chinese restaurant that has an affordable menu with good noodle/rice/congee dishes and sharing plates.</li><li>The congee was great, an the dishes were pretty good, albeit on he salty side.</li><li>The other dishes were good. we over-ordered as usual but enjoyed the food!</li><li>In fact, for a change, order dishes which have the identifier ' pepper' in the name.</li><li>The waiter filled our tea and removed our dishes throughout the meal.</li><li>We ordered several dishes: Scrambled egg &amp; shrimp, wonton lo mein, yeung chow fried rice, peking style pork &amp; crispy chicken.</li><li>Our table of 9 cleaned up 8 dishes ... no leftovers.</li><li>Both are available at many other Chinese places, but are priced higher than this place and the portion for both dishes here were incredible.</li><li>More of a quick dinner or get together and you 'd like to try out all these different dishes for a cheap price.</li><li>Come in a small group for fast seating and to order many dishes.</li><li>However, I do appreciate that their food is not too oily or salty!- other pros: LARGE portions, large variety of congee and noodles, friendly staff- con: can become very crowded: ( side dishes I 've tried and liked: tofu and garoupa, house special chicken, mushroom and beef, tofu and mixed veggie congees I 've tried and liked: mixed vegetable and sweetcorn, sweetcorn and beancurd. congees I 've tried and disliked: sliced fish congee tastes bland ....</li><li>Dining here is a hit or miss, most dishes are fairly good and a few are barely a pass but for an Asian place trying to past off French Food and Bakery their dishes are quite good.</li><li>Dining here is a hit or miss, most dishes are fairly good and a few are barely a pass but for an Asian place trying to past off French Food and Bakery their dishes are quite good.</li><li>Also, this place stays true to its roots- Cantonese-styled dishes; generous portions and quick to make.</li><li>Always order these 2 dishes and never get turn down.</li><li>I tried a variety of the dishes because their were a few of us at the table, and normally i would name what I ate and give a little description but it just seemed all the food was uninspired, dry and some seemed crispy like it was under a heat lamp for an extended period of time.</li><li>The only concern was how clean the place is and how well they wash their dishes.</li><li>These dishes are usually 13-17 dollars and the portions are laughable.</li><li>We all had a mixtures of dishes, butter chicken, vindaloo, tikka masala, naan breads and they even did a special of bombay potatoes ( it was n't on the menu!) the food was just divine!</li><li>Yummy butter chicken, good Naan and rice, with other dishes that have flavour.</li><li>I have been asked
