<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 7439' %><h2>pulao<br />occurrence: 1</h2><div><ol><li>I mean I do n't expect everyone in the world to know about celiac disease/gluten allergies but I do expect People running a business in the food industry to bloody well be aware of all food related allergies.Next, lets discuss the food: The pulao was good and so was the Chana Masada.But what completely put me off was the tandoori kababs and the butter chicken.The tandoori stuff tasted like they were a day old if not more.The shrimp was disgusting! I had to spit it out of my mouth after taking a bite of it.What was prepared in the name of butter chicken made me want to barf!</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
