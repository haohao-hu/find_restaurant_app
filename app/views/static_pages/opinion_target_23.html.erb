<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 23' %><h2>pizza<br />occurrence: 287</h2><div><ol><li>My friends had the hot wing, I 'm not usually a hot wings person so I was just happy with my pizza and white zinfandel.</li><li>The pizza tastes great.</li><li>The pizza was exactly how we asked them to make it and their wings are amazing.</li><li>Best pizza in the area, very flavourful and affordable, beats pizzaville from down the street any day Great pizza at great prices.</li><li>The owners are friendly and efficient, and the pizza is great .... what more do you need ?</li><li>When I order pizza I play by some basic rules;- I always ask for my pizza to be well done, especially if the store likes to rush the job ( I 'm looking at you, P.P.)- I remind the driver about dipping sauces, cuz they forget to give them 90% of the time ( seriously, D. ` s, get your $* &amp;% together)- Even if they offer Interac they do n't always bring it with them, so gotta ask ( P.H. has never once remembered)- The drivers and order-takers are sometimes the worst ppl to talk to ( P.N. ugh)- Toppings are often wrong on first orders ( I 'll never forgive you Mama) I was n't sure what to expect when I called.</li><li>When I order pizza I play by some basic rules;- I always ask for my pizza to be well done, especially if the store likes to rush the job ( I 'm looking at you, P.P.)- I remind the

n't sure what to expect when I called.</li><li>But a tear came to my eye when I saw the pizzas were perfectly cooked, all the toppings were correct, the two dipping sauces were nestled snugly against the cardboard corners in a strangely cute way, and it was just plain ol ' delicious pizza.</li><li>Summary: great prices, amazing friendly service, nothing fancy but it is the best pizza option in North York for its price range at the moment A really small Tim Horton 's, understandable given the area.</li><li>Friendly and prompt service, the best pizza I 've ever had in Toronto, and overall just amazing.</li><li>A pretty good pizza with a light, crispy crust.</li><li>The vegan pizza was amazing ( Diana V) and the other pizza was not.</li><li>They conceded that the crust was good, but their pizza was bland and the chicken was dry.</li><li>I found that the vegan pizza was good, but was unevenly salted ... some bites would be normal, and some bites would be really salty.</li><li>Over the past year the quality of their pizza has fallen substantially ( specifically this location).</li><li>But will still go to other locations Good pizza but the service is absolutely terrible.</li><li>Their pizza is nice, fresh, and delicious.</li><li>Positive: + open very late + very reasonable price for good quality food + good variety in menu Negative:- parking can be an issue in busy hours- their amazing pizza takes toooo long to be ready!</li><li>The pizza was small and the toppings were weird.</li><li>There was what appeared to be ground `` Spam'' meat on the pizza.</li><li>Their pizza is unique in a sense that the crust is thick and filled with toppings and sauce.</li><li>It 's how they make pizza in Iran.</li><li>The place suppose to be Persian food but it seemed more American to me as it is all fries, pizza and subs.</li><li>Over all I recoment this place specially on Tuesday as they have half price pizza and they rose pizza.</li><li>The pizza was okay.</li><li>YAY !! love their calamari, &amp; have tried some of their pizza 's, &amp; some are good, some are ok, but depending on individual tastes.</li><li>I probably be back to try out their pizza!</li><li>The pizza also had a very generous serving of prosciutto and was big enough that we had to take home half of it.</li><li>Tried both their pasta and pizza, pizza is better.</li><li>Tried both their pasta and pizza, pizza is better.</li><li>So gross, please avoid this horrible place! was ordering a pizza from that location, tonight. the pizza was OK. and they came just on the last second as they were looking for my house. would not order again probably, there are way better places for pizza in the area like King David Kosher Pizza.</li><li>You can buy the pizza by the slice here and the slices are actually really big.</li><li>However, I prefer getting an entire pizza to take back home because it 's hot, fresh and delicious.</li><li>The pizza was actually really good.</li><li>For instance, last night our waiter asked my brother if he wanted extra mushrooms on his pizza.</li><li>The pizza was okay but it was generally incohesive and the sauce and toppings were disheveled while the base was borderline frozen.</li><li>Also, you can get as much of the pizza as you want and I love their pizza.</li><li>The pizza is cooked in a brick oven and is more of a thin crust style pizza.</li><li>I just go back for the pizza ~ ~ ~ i 've had pastas and appetizers. and Whatevers ...</li><li>I really only go to the restaurant when I crave for the pizza ..</li><li>It 's most quiet here during the weekend brunch hours, between 10:30 am- 3:00pm, where there 's all-you-can-eat scrambled eggs, pizza, roasted potatoes, pasta, salads and mussels ( $ 12.99).</li><li>3.5/5 STARS Had the Penne with the calamari and pizza, was delicious and had that authentic Italian taste!</li><li>The pizza showed up in about 25 minutes which was awesome, I love getting delivery fast and while it 's still hot.</li><li>The pizza was delicious, y' know for delivery pizza it was above average I found, nothing spectacular but good enough for me to go right to their website and order whenever someone comes by and wants to order pizza.</li><li>I can honestly say I 've had a truly great pizza delivered from this pizza Nova location, as well as some of the most disappointing pizza I 've ever ordered as well.</li><li>I can honestly say I 've had a truly great pizza delivered from this pizza Nova location, as well as some of the most disappointing pizza I 've ever ordered as well.</li><li>I 'm not sure if it 's a chef issue or a pizza oven issue or a supplier issue, but you just never know what you 're going to get.</li><li>The focaccia barese can be excellent, but tends to be overcooked, and the pizza is sometimes overcooked, sometimes undercooked, and sometimes amazing.</li><li>Every now and then I am lazy and decide I 'm up for some pizza roulette, and I spin the wheel and take my chances on what will be delivered, but usually I just drive down to Danforth Pizza House and pick up my pizza, so I know my experience will be excellent.</li><li>Horrible pizza.</li><li>I forgot why I do n't order from there, so I did, and now I remember; the cheese does n't stick to the pizza ... had to eat the cheese and crust separately.</li><li>The pizza is fresh, the staff is friendly.</li><li>My family also tells me the pizza and steak are amazing too, but I just ca n't seem to go there and NOT get the pork souvlaki on a pita!</li><li>The Pizza is also not to be missed.</li><li>Their pita bread is good, nice and chewy, and it makes me wonder if they use the same base for their pizza, since I see a lot of neighborhood people ordering their pizza, we keep meaning too- but we keep going back to their souvlaki pitas.</li><li>Their pita bread is good, nice and chewy, and it makes me wonder if they use the same base for their pizza, since I see a lot of neighborhood people ordering their pizza, we keep meaning too- but we keep going back to their souvlaki pitas.</li><li>The pizza is so so.</li><li>While I was waiting for my pizza to be ready, I watched a cook open a freezer take out frozen escargot and plop it onto a metal dish, put some kinda sauce on it and threw it in the oven.</li><li>I asked the server ( who was n't very friendly) whats on the pizza.</li><li>The crust and sauce of the pizza was good, thats why we went back for more.</li><li>Pretty decent pizza.</li><li>I visited with my family for a great pizza.</li><li>No. but they are n't pizza pizza either.</li><li>Do n't try to order pepperoni on your pizza.</li><li>I recommend their pizza, falafel sandwich, spicy fries and the Cobb salad!</li><li>Top picks: vegetarian poutine, mac &amp; cheese, plain pizza Other good choices: kol bol salad, split pea soup I 've been going here my whole life.</li><li>This place has the most amazing pizza I 've ever had in my entire life and I am a pizza aficionado.</li><li>The pizza is OK to say the least, There are worse kosher pizza places in Toronto.</li><li>Best Pizza in the city!</li><li>I Wanted to grab a pizza to bring home to my family and always drive by Tov Li on my way home from work.</li><li>My family LOVED the pizza and literally ask for in at least twice a week.</li><li>I 've had their pizza and salads as well but the falafel is what brings me back.</li><li>This place has the best pizza.</li><li>They make a fantastic pizza and offer crusts with white, whole grain or spelt flour.</li><li>Went down and got a slice of pizza ( which I never do) because I was still hungry.</li><li>Our go to for a great pizza.</li><li>Their pizza was really delicious and they deliver.</li><li>Delivery man was courteous and we ordered from just-eat, and the pizza delivered was hot.</li><li>I was n't expecting much as this is just a little corner shop but after waiting over an hour, I finally got the pizza which was so bad I literally threw it out.</li><li>I used to think pizza was one of those things where even if it was bad, it was still pretty good.</li><li>Used to be the best pizza in TO when it was the original owner.</li><li>Pizza arrived piping hot and was probably the best pizza I have had in a while.</li><li>EVERY pizza has mozzarella.</li><li>I was not a huge fan of their soup ( mayte that particular one was n't that great- just raosted pepper), but I LOVE their pizza and their pasta.</li><li>They also usually have specials for that day for pasta and pizza that is n't on the menu.</li><li>All their pizza is wood oven, and i 've tried traditional, milano, Calabrese and all their dough was nicely done, love the thin crust and they are generous on their toppings.</li><li>The pizza was a little different as it had a tomato aioli sauce.</li><li>Will definitely come for the pizza.</li><li>I 'd go back for the pizza for sure.</li><li>Also I actually tried the food aside from the pizza.</li><li>We 'd eaten here before and really enjoyed the pizza, so were looking forward to a lovely dinner, and just ended up supremely disappointed.</li><li>Sorento is a great restaurant if you 're looking for good pizza which is reasonably priced.</li><li>I tried a piece of the pizza and it was also quite good but not as good as I was anticipating given the wood oven preparation.</li><li>During our meal 10 other patrons arrived ( 2 were children) Only one waiter, and one chef, tending the large pizza oven.</li><li>We ordered a pizza and pasta dish to share ( the pasta was, as expected, perfectly al dente, and the pizza was good too, not the standard thin crust at Pizzeria Libretto type places.</li><li>There was no presentation done on the pizza.</li><li>I 'd say excellent cheese pizza, but not so excellent margarita pizza: P I do n't want to give this place a 4/5 because of the pizza because it seems like a nice Italian restaurant.</li><li>One of the waiters almost bent over backwards for us, accommodating our very particular pizza preferences ( we wanted half the pizza with marinara and half with pesto), attentively refilling our waters and bread baskets, and just all around ensuring our dining experience was a good one.</li><li>Recenlty had the pizza, and it was delicious.</li><li>The pizza was so good, you could eat it cold!</li><li>Has a nice looking patio, and the inside looks good but place is super dusty, could use a good dusting before customers come. do n't waste your time like I did, worst pizza experience. yesterday I ordered a medium pizza with two dipping sauce, they had a% 50 percent deal going on so the total came up to $ 13. the pizza came OVER 2 HOURS later !! also the pizza was cold, it was n't even cut and they forgot my dipping sauce. the worst part was I called the store several times and every time it went to voicemail. the driver said he would pay for my next pizza if I call the next day and just explain what happened. when I called today the lady on the phone said the best she can do is give me% 75 off my price that I paid yesterday so I would pay around $ 3. when the pizza came this time the driver had a different price then what was told to me.</li><li>Has a nice looking patio, and the inside looks good but place is super dusty, could use a good dusting before customers come. do n't waste your

then what was told to me.</li><li>There was a lovely girl ( Dimpi) and another employee ( Meet), that went above and beyond for me and my boyfriend by making a delicious pizza, fast when the store was very close to closing time.</li><li>One thing that really annoys me about this location is for the past two years i have been coming here and every time i get a drink with my pizza its always warm.</li><li>Ordered a large pizza and breadsticks for delivery.</li><li>After waiting 45mins I noticed that the pizza was COLD.</li><li>The issue is that the pizza was horrible.</li><li>So I still paid and tipped that driver 20 percent and took the cold pizza and again sadly admit I heated it up and ate it.</li><li>I receive an employee on the phone who gets mad at me because I did not want to wait for the pizza.</li><li>A whole pizza chain and no pizza delivery.</li><li>As for the food we ordered hummus ( approx $ 6), veggie pizza ( $ 5.99), lamb plate ( $ 18.99), mixed meat plate ( $ 20.99) and falafel ( 0.99).</li><li>The kids had the pizza.</li><li>We ordered the babaganoush dip, cheese and spinach `` pizza'', and the full combo platter that came with 2 pitas and hummus dip.</li><li>The food itself was `` meh'', there are bazillion places around the city that serve a better bbq chicken, the pizza is basically marinara and a few pieces of pepperoni on a pita.</li><li>Anyway, I had a little bit of the pizza- thin crust, stone baked.</li><li>BUT the pizza is honestly the best in Toronto. if you are patient do it. the pizza is from a brick stove fired by wood. for some reason its just awesome. worth the wait.</li><li>BUT the pizza is honestly the best in Toronto. if you are patient do it. the pizza is from a brick stove fired by wood. for some reason its just awesome. worth the wait.</li><li>We ordered the daily pasta special ( sausage, mushrooms) &amp; a pizza ( Alla Peccorina, w/ black olive paste, garlic, mozzarella, goat chese, spinach &amp; black olives).</li><li>I have half a pizza left for dinner tonight:) It was heavenly &amp; crispy!</li><li>`` Your pizza is almost done.''.</li><li>And she walked away only to return with our pizza 5 minutes later!</li><li>My wife 's pizza was burnt by the the crust, which can be obviously seen her the server, while my pizza was n't burnt but was lacking toppings ( there were only one small/medium size shrimp on each slice of the 4 slice pizza, and there were small traces if scallops which I could hardly taste).</li><li>My wife 's pizza was burnt by the the crust, which can be obviously seen her the server, while my pizza was n't burnt but was lacking toppings ( there were only one small/medium size shrimp on each slice of the 4 slice pizza, and there were small traces if scallops which I could hardly taste).</li><li>I decided on a pizza, I asked if I could change the mushrooms to onions and I was rudely told I could n't.</li><li>Worst excuse for a pizza I 've seen, awful service.</li><li>When, out of desperation, I asked for some Parmesan, I was told that they charge extra and that the owner did not recommend it any way, as it would dry out the pizza.</li><li>I 'm not asking for your recommendation, you 're the one serving crappy pizza.</li><li>`` Not recommended'' THEY HAVE TO BE WRITING THEIR OWN POSITIVE REVIEWS. this is possibly the worst pizza in the world.</li><li>Over all, a nice place but if we come back, we 'll be sure to order something different next time! ok it 's no fluke the wood oven pizza here is very good. ( we ordered two kinds to try) the dough, sauce and cheese the base ingredients of most any pizza are top notch. the crust i would describe .. it 's not a thin where it 's paper thin and it 's not cooked crisp like I 've had at many other thin crust pizza places. having its so crisp hides the true identity of the pizza dough. how can one taste the crust if it 's burnt !? the crust is thin where one can bite into the dough know it 's dough and not thick enough to not overwhelm the toppings. my quattro stagione was made wrong though .. it suppose to be separate quarters of pizza with the individual toppings. but instead it was a pizza with all the toppings. c 'mon just because I do n't look italian does n't mean I do n't know how it 's suppose to be. do n't give me stupid excuses that things get roughed up in the oven that why that make it that way ? i do n't care for the chatty waitress here and the ridiculous excuses, but as i mentioned in my first review. i will come here for the food because the cooks and chefs in the back know what they are doing ..</li><li>The prices are fantastic for both the pizza and pop. For about $ 14 you can get two med pizzas worth of pure taste-bud indulgence.</li><li>By The Slice is one of the best pizza places I been to.</li><li>Good amount of toppings, but I 'm not a big fan of fluffy crust, sweet pizza sauce, and slightly undercooked pizza ( I just made it sound worse than it was ...</li><li>They 're pizza has a thicker crust than I normally like but they have a wonderful assortment of toppings with a lot of unusual toppings ( for takeout pizza) like avocado and roasted corn.</li><li>The pizza here is similar to that of Pizza Hut.</li><li>The pizza is a bit thinner than Pizza Hut though and tastier in my opinion.</li><li>The pepperoni and bacon are by far the best toppings you can get on pizza and they do n't skimp on the toppings here.</li><li>When I want pizza, I tend to go for these non franchise places ( or Papa Johns).</li><li>Amazing pizza!</li><li>Was also jealous of the pizza that the people at the next table ordered.</li><li>The delivery was reasonable and the pizza was very hot when it arived.</li><li>The pizza was properly cooked, so that the bottom has some char spots, the crust is slightly crispy, but not too much.</li><li>We were sad that they missed the sausage on the pizza.</li><li>The pizza is good with wonderful taste.</li><li>I like the fact they use real bacon chopped up on the pizza.</li><li>The people were nice and the pizza was fresh.</li><li>The server was super courteous and the pizza was great.</li><li>Did n't end up spending more than $ 7-8 for lunch got almost half a pizza with a pop. Ca n't beat that.</li><li>It was a GOOD pizza to my surprise.</li><li>I did n't think the pizza was anything special but the lasagna was great!</li><li>And, King David is no one trick pony, the pizza and burekas are solid as well.</li><li>I spent most of my time there being jealous of all the kids around me eating really good-looking pizza slices.</li><li>Friendly staff and delicious pizza, I 'll definitely be coming back for more.</li><li>Got pesto primavera which was delicious fresh green homemade pesto and the meat lovers pizza got garlic bread which was soft and delicious made with real butter and garlic After hearing good reviews from this place, my boyfriend and I decided to try it.</li><li>The pizza ?</li><li>The pizza was a simple mushroom pizza.</li><li>The pizza was pretty well done.</li><li>We always order from Paisanos because the pizza is easily one of my favourites in Toronto but every time we order our food is always hot!</li><li>I really like their pasta ( not much of their pizza though) and I try to experiment by ordering different pasta dish from time to time and they were all very tasty.</li><li>No one had it, but the pizza would probably be a good choice.</li><li>Being a lifelong lover of Italian food, especially pizza, I was very excited to try their restaurant.</li><li>They have an extensive menu consisting of pizza 's, pastas, sandwiches, salads and appetizers.</li><li>I 've been there a handful of times now, and every time I order the same thing because it 's guaranteed to be delicious: their `` basic'' pizza.</li><li>I know what you 're thinking, a basic pizza ?</li><li>Well, there is nothing basic about their `` basic'' pizza!</li><li>It 's the highest-quality pizza I 've ever had the opportunity to taste; it 's the perfect blend of tomato, sauce, cheese and crust.</li><li>I 'm confident I will continue to order and enjoy my basic pizza for years to come.</li><li>Not so good food comparing to price, pizza was soft and dough in the middle and staff are just not ready for the place.</li><li>Also getting very positive reviews were the seafood risotto, the grilled mixed seafood, the pizza, heck, pretty much everything we had.</li><li>The pizza was saggy and wet! we returned the chicken dish. and the waitress apologized many times.</li><li>They have some cut pizza and French bread as free bread ( which is a surprise!).</li><li>I got the Pizza Genovese which was wonderful.</li><li>He put our pizza in right away to make sure it was timed to be an appetizer.</li><li>Descent pizza.</li><li>The pizza was little burnt but still good.</li><li>I 'm also not pleased with constantly being asked to pay extra for everything ( buy a samosa, pay extra for chutney .. buy a pizza slice, pay extra for sauce).</li><li>Some prices I consider a bit too high relative to what is being offered ( $ 3.25 + tax for a pepperoni pizza slice plus you have to pay extra for dip, $ 8.99 + tax walk-in `` special ?'' is not exactly a great deal for a large pizza with only ONE topping- 3 months ago it was $ 7.99 https: //www.zomato.com/toronto/student-pizza-and-curry-north-york-gta/menu).</li><li>Delicious falafel balls, yummy salad and great selection of pizza slices.</li><li>The pizza was okay, nothing special, and the gnocchi was tasty but again nothing to write home about.</li><li>The pizza is rustic style and so tasty, loved the crust.</li><li>Edit: Came back about a month later to try their pizza and pasta.</li><li>The pizza was actually quite good, thin crust, cooked just right.</li><li>Via Casalinga- If you like Sicilian type pizza then you definitely need to try this.</li><li>On one recent visit, a pizza topped with prosciutto had it added before baking, causing it to become burnt.</li><li>And on another a `` wild mushroom'' pizza was bland and had little strong mushroom flavour.</li><li>For food we both ordered two types of pizza; Pollo al pesto and their Casaglina, along with two glasses of red wine.</li><li>The pizza lost the crispness it had.</li><li>The dough was soggy when it arrived and it really destroys the texture of the pizza.</li><li>Definitely avoid having pizza here.</li><li>Their pizza 's are also unique and very filling for one person.</li><li>They have a brick oven which makes the pizza even better.</li><li>The hit of the fig is unique and makes the pizza even better.</li><li>You can get the same pizza at half price if you pick it up yourself.</li><li>Anyways, the pizza is like any other pizza hut but I just do n't recommend coming here just because I can get better service at a pizza hut else where.</li><li>They are rude to customers and do n't know how to properly put cheese on the pizza.</li><li>Buy any medium or large pizza and get the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th medium $ 5 ( equal or lesser value to the full price pizza).</li><li>Worst pizza I have ever gotten.</li><li>Awfully undercooked pizza.</li><li>More than half the pizza was the crust.</li><li>Stopped in for a quick pizza, and it was worth it!</li><li>Definitely a good place to get pizza if your in the area.</li><li>If you live right at YandS your pizza will most likely be at your door in less than 30 mins, which is great!</li><li>They have this option of getting your pizza well done, which I didnt even know existed but it awesome.</li><li>Even pizza pizza up the road beats this place hands down!</li><li>Awesome pizza!</li><li>I popped in here the other night to grab a quick pizza before an event that a coworker and I were going to.</li><li>I do acknowledge this is a pizza chain, but the pizza was not actually too bad.</li><li>I do acknowledge this is a pizza chain, but the pizza was not actually too bad.</li><li>( I 've been served cold pizza before) Again, paying $ 20 for a large pizza is a little absurd.</li><li>When I called and spoke with the manager he says oh ya that sometimes happens with our veggie pizza, can I do anything for u, I was like can u send me another one and with annoyed voice he goes ok but please return the pizza to the driver, I said sure ( as if I was gonna eat that trash).</li><li>He wants to send another one of the same pizza he admitted they ca n't make it properly .at this point I was so angry i juust thanked and hung up the phone.now pizza is in trash, waste of money and time and I 'm still hungry.DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE.</li><li>He wants to send another one of the same pizza he admitted they ca n't make it properly .at this point I was so angry i juust thanked and hung up the phone.now pizza is in trash, waste of money and time and I 'm still hungry.DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE.</li><li>We get pizza delivered and have settled on our favourite.</li><li>I have to say this pizza was pretty darn good, there was a ton of cheese, without having to ask them to make sure there is cheese like some Pizza Pizza locations which I have stopped going to because they seem to hoard the cheese!</li><li>Another walk-in customer had to wait over an hour for their pizza, only to find out it was sitting on the counter the whole time.</li><li>I have noticed them putting the pizza cutter right by the counter where they put the money ... eeeek Do n't order takeout from here ... we wanted 1 simple pizza tonight and we ordered online.</li><li>It was amazing though, a ton of cheese, three kinds of meat ( sausage, peperoni, bacon) pan crust about 1 `` thick, it 's the stuff pizza dreams are made of.</li><li>It was New Years Eve and I had fond memories of my deep dish slice I had here at the North York Pizzaiolo a couple weeks so I for NYE I decided to order entire pizza.</li><li>There eyes widened and shortly after came a smoking burnt pizza.</li><li>They left the pizza in the oven too long and burnt it.</li><li>30 bucks for a pizza and i ended up with a loaf of bread with pizza toppings ..</li><li>The pizza was sort of like a crispy frozen flatbread with more sweet canned sauce, I was very disturbed.</li><li>The cafeteria-style food looked a little dry from being out in a cafeteria line for me, so I opted for a pizza, which would be made fresh.</li><li>The new `` Pizza Chef'' did n't even know what he had put on the pizza, and brought me the bowl to SEE what he used.</li><li>Ohh and this was after making the wrong pizza to start with.</li><li>The pizza is good but it was over $ 20 so I did n't try it again.</li><li>But what I go for is the delicious pizza.</li><li>Update: a lil tip, the pizza is best eaten right away.</li><li>The best thing here is the pizza as it 's made in a `` wood oven.''</li><li>We had a kid 's pizza and a Grilled Salmon today.</li><li>Their pizza here is good too.</li><li>He recommended either pizza, rosti, or mussels ..</li><li>Would come back to try their rotisserie chicken if it was the right time of day and would also want to try their pizza ..</li><li>Stop turning everything into pizza, if we wanted pizza, we would have ordered pizza!</li><li>50 $ for a a small and medium pizza ?! ?!?!?!?!!?!??!</li><li>Not sure how you can call yourself Boston PIZZA and serve that kind of crappy pizza ...</li><li>Their namesake dish- pizza, was not impressive.</li><li>The pizza here is certainly better than places like Pizza Pizza but the price premium they charge does not justify it.</li><li>Looking at the price for pizza, I find it hard to justify a price of $ 35 ... even if it is Boston-style.</li><li>We ordered a bunch of appetizers and food for the table ( meats, cheese, pizza, potato, and roasted vegetables) there was a lot of food and it was just ok.</li><li>The pizza is a really big slice too so also worth the price.</li><li>People dig the pizza but I only go for the veal.</li><li>They have great pizza and the best/ biggest veal sandwich in Toronto.</li><li>Bottom line, a return visit is in order, and hopefully the service wo n't be a mirage. ( pun intended) Went in for a quick dinner weeknight, our server was real nice and cheerful, ordered the pizza ( as it was listed as freshly made in the kitchen) and did not disappoint. there was abit of an accident on the ocean harvest ( and there were way too much of grilled pepper in the dish), but the manager got it taken care of for us diligently.</li><li>This location unlike some of the other ones, does not offer pasta, pizza, French fries or have a hot table or have the mini sandwiches.</li><li>I always try to get something different each time I dine here, and have n't been disappointed with anything yet, but when in doubt I go for the pizza.</li><li>I was literally 800m away from this resturant, so I called and asked for delivery ( pizza) And they said it would be a $ 8 delivery charge !!</li><li>Great taste pizza.</li><li>I often order Hwaiian and Extravaganza for late dinner after work and the pizza taste always great.</li><li>They never disappoint and the pizza is always hot and fresh when I go pick it up.</li><li>This location has very late hours ( weekdays closing at 1AM) which satisfies the need for any late night munchies of a dirty, oily pizza.</li><li>The pizza in this place is also very good.</li><li>Food is amazing, especially their pizza.</li><li>But, Tov Li is kosher and vegetarian so do n't expect to find any meat on your pizza.</li><li>The food is decent, the ordering system is messed up but if you want a slice of pizza, a falafel, a shakshuka, or a massive salad then is is your place.</li><li>I Wanted to grab a pizza to bring home to my family and always drive by Tov Li on my way home from work.</li><li>My family LOVED the pizza and literally ask for in at least twice a week.</li><li>There is a promo going on now, where if you purchase a large or medium pizza, you can get a 2nd, 3rd or 4th pizza for $ 5 !!!</li><li>There was n't enough cheese, and the few strands of fries on the pizza was crispy but lacked flavor.</li><li>Overall, this pizza tasted too bland and dry.</li><li>I had to pack the leftovers, which were still delicious the next day for those who enjoy cold pizza.</li><li>I do n't have pizza cravings often, but when I get them again, I 'm coming back here!</li><li>The pizza is still good though and I suppose that 's all that matters if your ordering out.</li><li>By far this is the worst pizza Hut location I had ever been.</li><li>After we ordered we waited more than 45 minutes to get our pizza.</li><li>When we got our pizza it was cold.</li><li>We did n't see any reason why our pizza took so long to be served as we where the only ones in the restaurant.</li><li>All pizza was old and cold.</li><li>After a short discussion she came back saying that we were restricted to only a few choices such as the Canadian pizza; basically just the few specialty pizzas with the least amount of toppings.</li><li>All you can eat pizza is probably the worst thing they could have possibly done.</li><li>Have you ever seen the people that come in here to eat the all you can eat pizza ?</li><li>You 'd think that if you need to walk sideways through a door, you probably should n't be eating pizza.</li><li>Now that being said, I do like the all you can eat pizza and I do indulge in it every now and then.
