9/10 Family-oriented.</li><li>I got the bulgogi which was very tasty ( portion and price were reasonable), my friends got the dol-sot bibimbop ( portion was a bit on the small side but looked quite delicious), and naengmyeon ( generous portion size and perfect for the hot weather we 've been having lately).</li><li>We kept having those two refilled: p The price is reasonable for the portion

food was not worth the price we paid.</li><li>The price is average, a little higher for some but I felt it was worth the quality of sushi I received.</li><li>Had the seafood pancake as well ( too much

plaza 5, Price- It 's not the cheapest place you can go to but it 's worth every penny.</li><li>The price has increased slightly since my initial visit over a year ago.</li><li>For the price increase they should offer sashimi at lunch but they do n't.</li><li>Well worth the price ( $ 25 weekend dinner) and will probably go again when I feel like going through another food coma lol.</li><li>Price

too.</li><li>The price was very reasonable $ 20 per person.</li><li>The price is fair for italian resturant.</li><li>The seafood green onion pancake was good, but not sure if it 's worth the price.</li><li>It was barely warm, and the overall amount I got was n't worth the price ( and very little beef was added).</li><li>Spicy Seafood Hot Pot ( $ 14.99)- If you are into fish, you would love this dish- If you are hungry, you would be stuffed- If you are into noodles, you will be in heaven- I wish this is more spicy- This definitely not that live seafood hot pot I had before with all those seafood tossed in alive .. but good enough at this price!</li><li>Price here is pretty good and portion is big.</li><li>The price was right and definitely good value.</li><li>The prices were also extremely reasonable, compared to the place I used to frequent by Yonge and Finch ( at least half the price for table cooking!).</li><li>We ordered a set meal that came with a Bibimbap, korean style fried chicken, BBQ pork belly and a seafood pancake- all for a very reasonable price.</li><li>I just do n't know whether the food was worth that price.</li><li>I mean, virtually ever other restaurant nearby serves a full meal for two for half that price, or cheaper.</li><li>I enjoyed their food a lot, they had good quality sushi at a reasonable price.</li><li>Price- right, so when I get the bill I remember why I do n't come here more.</li><li>Go somewhere else with good tasting authentic thai for half the price.</li><li>Not only did they NOT have Siam noodles, the service was snail paced slow, the waitress forgot our water and our spring rolls, the portions vs price were underwhelming and the experience was tasteless and expensive.</li><li>Price is however double of that of SK.</li><li>There is only one thing that keeps this place from being 5 star for me, price.</li><li>Price wise look for it to top out around $ 12 for the 10 pieces of Cevappi on a bun with the `` fixins'', one you start eating these, they are seasoned and I normally do n't like lamb, but because of the mix of meat I am unable to detect the lamb from the other meats, which can be a good thing, if you 're like me and do n't like how grassy Lamb tastes.</li><li>I ordered a bowl of pho which tasted alright, but the portion itself was small and definitely not worth the price.</li><li>The food came out pretty fast within 10 minutes of our order and the price is quite reasonable.</li><li>The price was affordable too.</li><li>However the price is up there.</li><li>Price: We ordered way to much and came to approx $ 30 a head.</li><li>Then there was no one in this place at 6:30pm- it 's sushi! there is ALWAYS someone in a sushi restaurant ... oh no: ( The price of the AYCE was decent and we ordered our meal.</li><li>The price was reasonable as well.</li><li>We have tried the Vegetarian Pan Fried Noodle- the flavour was average but the portion was worth the price.</li><li>Great food portions and Price.</li><li>I have somewhat began making the dish at home myself because a basa fish fillet ( 2 fillets actually) come up to about cheaper ( about half the price) than the meal itself.</li><li>I could n't believe the portion size considering the price.</li><li>The price I paid was 12.99 for the plate and trust me even the shawrma plates at food courts in a mall are better tasting than theirs.</li><li>Price: $ 140 ( before tip) Thank goodness I had a $ 70 voiture!</li><li>The bottom line is the lobster is still very good but the lobster bisque is out and the price has been increased.</li><li>The lobster is very fresh and price is reasonable ( around $ 35- $ 40 if you do n't order drinks or anything else).</li><li>Price is also higher than most of other pho restaurants.</li><li>Servings were n't as much as other places and price is just the same if not higher.</li><li>Price, portions, speed, taste, hours, selection.</li><li>The staff just served as normal and the price was reasonable too.</li><li>Price is a little higher compared to Markham/Richmond Hill, but still pretty good value.</li><li>The price was n't too bad for the fact that we ordered their specials rather than the standard fare food.</li><li>This is run of the mill Chinese food but for a slightly premium price.</li><li>The price is on the high end for congee joints, but it 's still really reasonable for Chinese food.</li><li>The price is great and the food is usually good!</li><li>If you want fantastic chinese food that is at an affordable price this is the place to go.</li><li>Nice desserts, large portion, good price and food comparing with similar restaurants.</li><li>The food are not the best, but worth that price.</li><li>What I got was definitely not worth the premium price.</li><li>The food was okay, but the portions are small, considering the price.</li><li>The price is not bad but drinks are so so.</li><li>Taste of the food was just average, not worth the price paid for it!</li><li>However, the service is pretty awful here, the food is mediocre ( portions are quite small) and the price is INFLATED and definitely not worth the asking price for most drinks.</li><li>The price.</li><li>Price is reasonable.</li><li>The price was pretty high considering I ordered a basic meal however.</li><li>At $ 22.99, the price is reasonable, but more expensive than Chingu.</li><li>Although the price is cheap ( 6.75 for an entree), the content and quantity is abysmally small.</li><li>Galleria has much more authentic korean food and the price is less then half of Joon 's.</li><li>The price was a bit high, costing around $ 61 for two adults, but on a Sunday the restaurant is practically empty and I expected to pay that much for an all you can eat place.</li><li>Great service, selection and price.</li><li>The price was just under $ 17, food tasted decently great, the portion is a lot!</li><li>I would say the sushi is 7 out of 10 and price is 10 out of 10.</li><li>I was most impressed w/ the size of the rolls ... it was ENORMOUS: D The price is n't bad either!</li><li>Food Quality &amp; Price: Decent sushi ( not the best) but for the price, you ca n't go wrong.</li><li>Good portion with very reasonable price, friendly staffs and fast service.</li><li>Price is right Portion is big Take out only Cash or debit Shared the Small Party Combo ( Sushi &amp; Sashimi) between my friend and I. $ 24 tax included.</li><li>A combination of the Price, quality and Size it gives is among of the better deals you will find around North York.</li><li>Their sushi is pretty decent, the price is pretty awesome.</li><li>The rolls are HUGE though ... so it is worth the price I guess, but they are hard to squeeze in your mouth!</li><li>Price is very competitive as well.</li><li>Sashimi is very fresh and the price is reasonable!</li><li>Not my favourite place for sushi and sashimi, but if you want a good or cheap price this is your gold mine!</li><li>For this price I guess they should get 5 stars, but because I prefer better/ fresher sashimi I really ca n't see myself coming back.</li><li>That being said, the speed and price certainly show in the quality of the food- everything was just kind of `` meh''.</li><li>While the price is right, I would much rather pay a few dollars more elsewhere for better variety in a sushi combo and overall better quality.</li><li>The price is good.</li><li>Pretty good sushi for a small price.</li><li>Come on !!! and tax included! it tastes quite fresh too! the sushi here is soo cheap yet sooo gooood ( for the price). i ended up walking out with about 160 pieces of sushi and only paid $ 132 dollars ( including the party plastic tray which is around 10-13 dollars extra and tax) which is a VERY GOOD price compared to other sushi places. tastes are slightly above average. fresh fish and more.</li><li>It will never be the best, but getting pretty good sushi at an excellent price is never a bad thing.</li><li>Other than that, service was great, food was filling and worth the price.</li><li>The only bonus is the cheap price but the food quality is poor.</li><li>The price is great and the value is great too.</li><li>Price is still same and affordable tho!</li><li>Now they 've gotten busy and opened another location at yonge and steeles the fish has gotten super thin and the price has been raised.</li><li>Best price in the city!</li><li>But the portions are on the large side without being mammoth and the price is pretty good.</li><li>I do n't think they have their sandwiches in the box like they used to at least not as big a box and not as low a price.</li><li>The price is pretty cheap, considering the amount of food and quality.</li><li>If you 're just going in for lunch they have bowls of noodle soup, or even lunch specials at a very reasonable price.</li><li>It 's too bad this place ca n't find a rhythm, the food is incredible but the overall rushed feeling combined with delayed service is not worth the price.</li><li>The food is excellent- as another poster said, it is restaurant quality for a more affordable price.</li><li>The price is a bit steep for a panera bread style Italian eat even with the extremely tasty food and friendly service. certainly not worth the dozens of toilet trips.</li><li>Via Cibo serves comforting Italian meals at a somewhat affordable price.</li><li>Off the bat I was blown away by the combination of taste, portion and price.</li><li>Great concept, its restaurant quality food at a more affordable price.</li><li>Price is also very reasonable.</li><li>The price is very good, not too expensive.</li><li>The service has ALWAYS been bad ... like, you feel you 're inconveniencing them when trying to get your order in or to ask for the bill- bad ... but it was tolerable back when the food was pretty good, for a reasonable price.</li><li>Price is cheap for what u get.</li><li>Price is average leaning towards the cheaper side around the area.</li><li>This meal is def enough for 2 people and at a very reasonable price ( $ 45).</li><li>They said it would be the same price.</li><li>Totally worth the price.</li><li>Price: 3/5, not bad at all around $ 20 per person.</li><li>Price is slightly higher than other Korean fried chicken place.</li><li>Pre-set seems to be $ 16.99 ( regular price).</li><li>This is by far one of the best Pita Pit locations to grab food at a very reasonable price.</li><li>Little spot tucked away in between other restaurants, they make a Solid jerk chicken but the price is a little on the high side unless you come here between 11 and 1 pm and enjoy the lunch special, fried chicken and rice for $ 4.99.</li><li>Small place but friendly people, great jerk chicken, and price was just right.</li><li>The price seemed to be a little high, since the food is for the most part deep fried.</li><li>The price is not bad at all for such a good dessert.</li><li>Food Quality &amp; Price: Size, portion and prices of crepes and waffles are comparable to Demetres.</li><li>Super friendly service, nice ambience, reasonable price.</li><li>I had similar or better crepes in food court for half the price.</li><li>Overall it 's a great place to try, however next time, I will go to food court, order the same crepes with drinks at half the price.</li><li>The price is reasonable but I would n't say it is cheap.</li><li>The large portion is chicken and rice for $ 10 and worth the price.</li><li>However, I read some good reviews on the oxtail and will give it a try next time! $ 4.99 Jerk Chicken special was worth the price.</li><li>The price is slightly above average than the standard Jamaican restaurant.</li><li>I mostly enjoy good food at an affordable price.</li><li>Their portions are reasonably sized and price for lunch.</li><li>I paid $ 42 for 2 medium pizzas so with this price I was expecting something decent.while the 4 cheese one ( bomba) was not bad the veggie lover which had spinach, mushroom pepper and tomato was a disaster the whole thing tasted and felt like it was drenched in water.</li><li>My friend ordered Cali maki rolls and she let me try them, they were alright but I was expecting more of them considering the price.</li><li>I would n't recommend this place for their rolls. convenient location, inside the emptess walk plaza, downstair from the movie theatre. the food is average and service is okay but i find it expensive compared to the quality of the food. but i understand it is due to the location. but i 'd go to other sushi place just a steeet away at sheppard where u have more choice: kiyomizu, ichiban springgarde, sakura, sushi moto, and sushi one. the price is cheaper w better quality bc of the competition.</li><li>You can also purchase movie tickets at a lower price when your bill is over thirty.</li><li>Price- 4/5- in comparison with the other sushi places in this area this place is fairly priced.</li><li>I usually get the bento box as it is usually what is most worth the price.</li><li>Price is higher end, some of the items seemed a bit overpriced.</li><li>But then with that price I expect more than just 3 slice of eel on rice as a side dish in my take out box.</li><li>Parking: Plenty Price: Not worth it Wait: Long just to get seated.</li><li>The quality for the food was worth the price.</li><li>In conclusion, Yuki is good for having little bit sushi taste with cheap price.</li><li>For the price not bad but if your a big eater then the portions are n't that big.</li><li>The sushi is great and the price is pretty reasonable.</li><li>Its not starbucks, but for half the price, who 's complaining ?</li><li>For a diner, they have ok food but definitely not worth the price.</li><li>Mediocre food, expensive price.</li><li>Lots of quality food for very reasonable price.</li><li>Yes, your prices are still low, but it 's time you consider raising that price a tad, instead of taking out quality.</li><li>Price was excellent as well.</li><li>The price is super cheap!</li><li>The price was very reasonable for the quantity of soup, rice, and banchan we received.</li><li>The price was n't high.</li><li>The price is right, we paid $ 30 incl. tip.</li><li>Well worth the price for the amount of food that you get, and it 's delicious.</li><li>Either way, the service is friendly and the price is quite decent compared to other places.</li><li>I would have preferred pork bone soup: ( Service &amp; staff are friendly and fast, price is right, but I think I 'm going to continue my journey to search for an even better place.</li><li>For that price and the tastiness of the soup, you ca n't go wrong.</li><li>Overall one of my favorite Korean spots in North York. love this place! friendly environment, reasonable price and delicious soup! the only thing they could work on is perhaps on the decorations inside the restaurant, but when the food is so good and fast, who cares if the walls are bare.</li><li>Could n't complain with this price!</li><li>Stuff &amp; owner are very friendly people, fast service, price are very cheap, foods are not good as the others things, unfortunately.</li><li>On top of that, there were no explanations or apologies for the unexpected price increase.</li><li>Best food reasonable price.</li><li>The price is a bit higher than what I 'd expect from other Italian bakeries.</li><li>First time to take my daughter to this place, I used to go there quite a lot in the early 2000, but then, we did n't go as we found that their price is a bit too high but the quality of the food does not qualify with that.</li><li>I should 've trusted my instinct and ordered from pizza pizza for half the price ... plus a 2 for 1 coupon for the movies.</li><li>Price is reasonable, and the staple gamjatang ( which thankfully has no staples!) will always feature meat which can slide off the bones ... and noticeable amounts of oil.</li><li>Portion sizes were average and price is pretty cheap.</li><li>The price was a little ... pricer than we 'd liked, but w/e, if it was good food, then it 'd be worth it.</li><li>Portions and price are good for what you 're getting.</li><li>Price for a veal dinner is about $ 23 before tax.</li><li>Awesome food, friendly, on point service, and extremely reasonable price.</li><li>They have the typical Shanghai food, and the price is pretty good.</li><li>The price has been going up on this dish and portions have been shrinking ... but it still tastes good after all these years.</li><li>Asian Legend ( at this location at least) is the real deal and well worth the price premium they charge.</li><li>So many super thin pieces of tender veal in the sand which really worth the price.</li><li>The pizza is a really big slice too so also worth the price.</li><li>Price is extremely affordable and great quality.</li><li>Pros Good portion Cons not worth the price Nothing special for $ 10.</li><li>This good food for fair price.</li><li>Other than that, it is pretty good in terms of the reasonable price and food quality.</li><li>Price is reasonable.</li><li>Price was n't too bad either compared to other korean places in Toronto.</li><li>Great food, cheap price.</li><li>- Everything else is pretty decent- Price is good Service: 1/5 stars- I 've been here multiple times and I have been to their other locations and I can tell you that I have never experience exceptional service.</li><li>The price is fair.</li><li>The price is very reasonable and they give generous amount of side dishes.</li><li>Food Quality &amp; Price: I ordered a 1/2 Chicken Shawarma wrap which comes with a soup/salad, I opted for Caesar.</li><li>Decently good food, not worth the price.</li><li>The price is affordable and big portion- ranges from $ 5-15 per dish.</li><li>The price was reasonable and fair.</li><li>It was worth the price.</li><li>In addition, the price is reasonable for the portion size and the atmosphere is quite nice.</li><li>I need a place that can offer real sushi, for a moderately fair price.</li><li>The price is as I said, moderate.</li><li>The price was fairly reasonable as well.</li><li>The price is fair and the food was well prepared.</li><li>The food was good considering the price ( $ 19.99 Mon-Thurs).</li><li>And the price is a good $ 2 to 3 lower than the other all-you-can-eat Japanese place around here, Sushi One.</li><li>The price on weekends is a little high but it 's not much more expensive than other sushi places.</li><li>The unagi dish was $ 38, and though it was absolutely delicious, the price is a tad expensive.</li><li>I would n't splurge on sushi here, as the same amount of nigiri/sashimi elsewhere would be less than half the price.</li><li>Bottom line, if you wanna find a good dinner at a reasonable price, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND coming here!</li><li>The price is a bit on the high side for lunch.</li><li>The price is cheap considering it 's on Yonge Street. great food and big portions.</li><li>With the groupon, I feel the place is barely ok in terms of price.</li><li>The price is generally about 25% more than other restaurants in the area.</li><li>We started off with the appetizer platter, which was ok. definitely not worth the price though.</li><li>I really do n't get the hype about St. Louis and their wings .. there 's only 3 flavours, they 're super small and not anything worth their price.</li><li>However this price did not include gratuities to the server so we had to add a few extra dollars on
