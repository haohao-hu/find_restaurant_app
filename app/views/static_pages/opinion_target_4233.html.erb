<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 4233' %><h2>dipping<br />occurrence: 1</h2><div><ol><li>Has a nice looking patio, and the inside looks good but place is super dusty, could use a good dusting before customers come. do n't waste your time like I did, worst pizza experience. yesterday I ordered a medium pizza with two dipping sauce, they had a% 50 percent deal going on so the total came up to $ 13. the pizza came OVER 2 HOURS later !! also the pizza was cold, it was n't even cut and they forgot my dipping sauce. the worst part was I called the store several times and every time it went to voicemail. the driver said he would pay for my next pizza if I call the next day and just explain what happened. when I called today the lady on the phone said the best she can do is give me% 75 off my price that I paid yesterday so I would pay around $ 3. when the pizza came this time the driver had a different price then what was told to me.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
