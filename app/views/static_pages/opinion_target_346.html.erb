<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 346' %><h2>egg<br />occurrence: 11</h2><div><ol><li>I have n't tried many other things on the menu because I tend to stick to what I like ( selective eater over here) but I have tried their egg drop soup in the past which was very good as well as the roast beef sandwich.</li><li>The only thing missing from their menu is the egg or milk pudding ( dun daan) I 'm not sure why they do n't make it.</li><li>I love egg benedicts so I ordered a vegetarian option that was not on the menu ( the menu in general is not super veg friendly) for some reason they give you an option of having the eggs hard, medium or soft which I never experienced before in any of the brunch places. bennies just always come soft- otherwise they 're not bennies but hard boiled eggs on top of an english muffin, the portion included only side of fries and two bennies with spinach. no slices of orange, no toast included. total of $ 9 the spinach somehow had very grassy taste. hollandaise sauce was too salty and flavorless ... the whole food tasting experience was just blah. on the other end the service was very nice and even though they confused my friend 's order the replacement came in in matter of seconds and she was charged less. but I 'm not going back for eggs ... maybe will check pancakes or waffles.</li><li>The egg was scaldingly hot but something in the sandwich was ice box freezing.</li><li>The egg was cooked nicely so that when cut, yolk ran out.</li><li>My friend ordered `` The Greens ' Egg White Omelette'' On the menu below all the Omelettes it states `` All omelettes served with toast and home fries'' however when the waitress took our order she told us that the omelette my friend ordered did n't get toast and home fries.</li><li>It finally came, it looks not bad with home fries .. however when I cut the first one, the egg was fully cooked !!</li><li>The egg was pre-dropped into the soup so by the time I got to it, it was already hard boiled.</li><li>The egg was good, but quite filling.</li><li>- Hot Stone Bibimbap: Was nice and hot and the egg was done right: runny.</li><li>Also, the egg was cooked perfectly.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
