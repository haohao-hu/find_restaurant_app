<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 92' %><h2>tea<br />occurrence: 63</h2><div><ol><li>They started off by serving us complimentary tea and appetizers ( including miso soup).</li><li>Their tea is always nice and strong flavor.</li><li>The tea was cold.</li><li>The server could of checked in on me to see if everything was good or if I needed anymore tea, however it was relatively busy for a single server.</li><li>As I was about to pay, a old lady ( looks like shes the manager or owner) realized I did not have tea, served it to me and apologized for having too much salmon in my dish.</li><li>I understand Kabuki is inside a mall specifically designed for rich old people ( Bayview Village) but seriously, I almost take offence at the level off rip-offing-ness that 's happening here and almost more so when I 'm forced to pay for the standard tea ( yes it 's an extra $ 1/ cup)!</li><li>The complimentary miso soup is also good ( size should be a little bigger) they do n't offer complimentary green tea ( like many places do) which for me is a turn off.</li><li>Customer service 100% Real Turkish food YES Good prices YES The best tea and dessert, you do not need to go back to Turkey!</li><li>The tea was cold as ice.</li><li>They do n't serve you the tea until the food comes.</li><li>Still did n't serve tea until all food came, waited almost 30mins for food when it 's not that busy, we ordered a beef bone noodle on the side but we found out there are same noodle comes with the gingsing chicken soup.</li><li>Yes it is becoming more common to have green tea included with the meal, but their tea is well brewed and never bitter.</li><li>Since bubble tea is so overpriced, paying anything less than $ 3 is a steal for me.</li><li>Sizzling plates are advertised, and the tea is great.</li><li>The tea is really strong.</li><li>I have been here for lunch, afternoon tea and dinner.</li><li>I personally thought the way the salads were presented was beautiful. really fresh fish for its low price. this sushi resaurant is actually one of the oldest in north york area since 1999 ( ? im pretty sure) when u enter, sushi bar greets u with irashaimasen and ur immediately seated by a waitress or waiter. hot green tea is usually given as soon as you seat down and after you order, some free edamame and tofu comes out. then u get the food u ordered ( fast) and ur tea is never emptied bc of the constant refill and quality checks. the place is old but i looks neat.</li><li>Their tea is good.</li><li>The tea is brought out pretty fast.</li><li>Firstly, they add tea to the menu, I 've never in my life had to pay for tea while having sushi, and here they charge $ 2, and $ 2 is n't a big deal obviously, however it 's the fact that I can walk 30 seconds to one of probably 15 sushi places in the area and they 'd never even try to charge for that.</li><li>The pearls were fresh and the tea was n't too syrupy.</li><li>At first when I received my drink, the sugar syrup and milk was poorly mixed ( the tea was still mostly at the bottom).</li><li>The quality of the tea here is just A-OK compared to other stores.</li><li>Sometimes I feel like the tea is water down a lot and lacks flavour a bit.</li><li>The selection of the type of tea are slightly more than other bubble tea shop.</li><li>I would avoid just getting plain tea because they add water to dilute the tea and it just does n't taste right.</li><li>I might passed on that as the tea was kind of lukewarm and lack the taste.</li><li>Other AYCE sushi restaurants will give you proper sushi and Miso Soup, for an even lower price ( 11.99 on most places for weekday lunch hours). bf and i came here last Sunday afternoon and had the gold menu for AYCE. it was less than average especially for the price, $ 21.99 on weekends and holidays and does not include drinks except for water and tea. this is the only AYCE place that comes out with our order of sashimi last. the most disappointing part was the food. salmon sushi were huge and sliced in cubes, steak cubes came in bits and pieces but was decent, buttered mushrooms were burnt, masago was too salty due to low quality, beef tataki was not fresh, i think the kalbi ribs were old cause they were so chewy i couldnt chew through them, spider roll was the worst! i couldnt even drink the tea cause the cups had such a strong bleach scent. needless to say, we will not be returning and would not recommend it to anyone.</li><li>It took them 10-15 minutes to bring us our tea and cups ... after I asked twice.</li><li>Ten Ren 's tea is always ranked as some of the best tea around, but I chose to get a frozen mango milk slushie thing with egg pudding and grass jelly instead.</li><li>Anyway, the tea was very milky and creamy, which I think is how it 's supposed to be, but it was a bit much for me.</li><li>The tea they have at this location, you can actually taste the tannins ( albeit very subtle) and the tea here is n't overwhelmingly sweet.</li><li>The tea they have at this location, you can actually taste the tannins ( albeit very subtle) and the tea here is n't overwhelmingly sweet.</li><li>The tea itself was meh, like a watered down purple sugary mix.</li><li>The Taiwanese food is authentic and possibly one of the best bubble tea places because they use real quality tea ( as opposed to powders or cheap tea).</li><li>The Taiwanese food is authentic and possibly one of the best bubble tea places because they use real quality tea ( as opposed to powders or cheap tea).</li><li>The tea was grapey, not too sweet.</li><li>Bubble tea was also pretty disappointing.</li><li>When you sit in, the tea is self serve, and their wasabi is home made.</li><li>Not sure if they have tea but did n't see anybody having any.</li><li>The bill came to $ 85 call me cheap but they charged us for the tea !!</li><li>We had to keep flagging them down to get tea, then menus then to order.</li><li>We had to ask million times for menu, tea, water, bill etc. we were very unhappy about the service and left a small tip.</li><li>Response time was good, and server kept our tea topped up throughout the meal.</li><li>Some of the ice-creams ( sesame, green tea, almond pistachio) are also homemade, giving it a strong prominent flavor.</li><li>The staff were incredibly friendly and hospitable, offering me a lovely green tea to nurse whilst waiting for my order.</li><li>Lunches are inexpensive and generous, tea is good too.</li><li>Service was very good, all of our dishes were removed the moment we finished, and our tea was always full.</li><li>There is plenty of tables so it 's good for larger groups, but expect to wait because the service is hit and miss. We came on a night that they were short staffed so we had to flag down service for tea a couple times, and they never came back with our change after paying the bill.</li><li>Before my order arrived, my friend and I were served some nice tea and a few side dishes.</li><li>The tea they brought out tasted like nothing.</li><li>I love the rice in the stone bowl at the end, but I wish they would pour tea inside instead of water.</li><li>They are generous with the amount of fruits they put on the waffles I ordered .... n I love fresh fruits so that 's what I will go back to Cora 's for .... also the tea was lovely and I loved the fact they keep asking for refills ..</li><li>When I got the bill they charged me for everything including the tea.</li><li>Warm tea is provided.</li><li>Small things make a difference- the tea should be hot, keep the bathrooms clean, leave a reorder sheet close by, cut right sized sashimi pieces.</li><li>Nothing really stood out other than the multiple flavours of ice creams ( vanilla, green tea, red bean, mango, ginger).</li><li>The biggest problem for me is that the tea and water to taste like soap- either the teapot or the cups are not rinsed thoroughly ... this is extremely off putting and hard to ignore when evaluating any restaurant.</li><li>At first, Symposium Caf√© gave off the '' coffee and tea '' vibe and then you dine in and their menu is like 50 lbs heavy.</li><li>The cake was not delicious, the tea was in a tea bag.</li><li>Their tea ( automatic drink) is very watery.</li><li>Menus have good variety and selection, and the tea is nice.</li><li>Afternoon tea is the best deal: From 3-5pm on weekdays, order a dish from the special menu and you get a free drink.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
