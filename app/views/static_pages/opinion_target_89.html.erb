In my head, I 'm wondering ' what kind of restaurant does n't have knives ?!' ( Side rant) I ended up just biting of it and then giving it to my friend after haha.</li><li>This restaurant does n't really specialize in korean bbq, but they certainly did have a couple options on the menu for it.</li><li>Apparently to him, this restaurant was n't that great from a Korean perspective, so just something to keep in mind.</li><li>The restaurant is outdated.</li><li>The restaurant is pretty small but we got lucky and did n't have to wait long for a table of 6.</li><li>The restaurant is always quite busy but you never have to really wait for a table unless you have a large group.</li><li>I like this restaurant because there broth is delicious.</li><li>The table also had wine and little carafes of vodka that we had purchased earlier and given to the restaurant earlier in the day.</li><li>I really do n't like this restaurant.</li><li>Well it was good, its not all you can eat and kinda on the pricier side but nice for dinner for 2 The restaurant was clean and the service was great.</li><li>The restaurant itself was very small and they must have had a very tiny budget for decor.</li><li>I mean, this restaurant does n't serve much other than their house specialty.</li><li>This restaurant needs a lot of improvement and new management!</li><li>The restaurant is open 24 hours and is consistently busy.</li><li>The restaurant itself was quite dirty.</li><li>I recommend this restaurant to everyone.</li><li>CONCLUSION: Customer service is a distinguishing factor in today 's competitive environment and this restaurant does n't cut it.</li><li>The restaurant itself was small, so I would n't go in with a group larger than 4.</li><li>The restaurant was fairly empty upon our arrival.</li><li>It used to be a very nice neighbourhood restaurant ...</li><li>With its small entrance tucked in the corner amid many other attention grabbing visuals, this restaurant could be easily bypassed just by virtue of being nearly invisible.</li><li>The atmosphere was nice but the restaurant was pretty dead on the Monday night we were there.</li><li>In my humble opinion, this restaurant needs a Menu makeover and stick to one or two things and do them very very well.</li><li>I might be over looked since I have n't had anything for 10 hours before I stepped in: P The restaurant is a little bit small since they have no window, but service was remarkable.</li><li>The restaurant is pretty petite, but service was quick and friendly and we were out in under an hour so that was great.</li><li>The restaurant is open six days a week with a live music and dancing show every night.</li><li>Frequented by locals, this restaurant 's business appears unaffected by its sub par Yelp reviews.</li><li>Well, this restaurant was like the ' Before' photo.</li><li>Not really a fine food/dining restaurant, Your regular India buffet style place ..</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
