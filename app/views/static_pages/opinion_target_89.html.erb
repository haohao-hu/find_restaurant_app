( not quite sure if that metaphor worked but, i gave it a go at least.).</li><li>Reason being more than half of it is healthy veggies and salads including my favorite beet and turnip pickles!</li><li>I skip vegetable soups for the reason that most critics avoid salads.</li><li>The menu is not extensive, but they are good at whatever they make, always fresh oysters and salads, wide variety of wines will not leave anyone disappointed.</li><li>I 've eaten here multiple times having either the pizzas, appetizers, salads, lunch sandwiches or entrees and they are all absolutely delicious!</li><li>I wish the salads were a bit bigger.</li><li>Get your burgers, steaks, pasta, and salads here at Kelsey 's!</li><li>As Karl said, these salads were piled high.</li><li>Service was a bit slow due to how busy the place was on a weekend evening but they took care of us and gave us salads and soups and ice creams for the entire party even though only two of the orders actually came with all that.</li><li>Every time I ate soup there it was good, salads are good, main entrees are great if you 're into European food.</li><li>Their salads were amazing as there were warm components to it and both were very flavourful.</li><li>Healthy-choice entrees Artisanal products ( made with love) Homemade soups and salads Homemade wraps and sandwiches Prepared pastas, sauces and noodles Ready-made lasagna Gluten-free options One of the first things I noticed when we got to Tutto Pronto was the ambiance.</li><li>The salads showed up a few minutes later, clearly forgotten.</li><li>The salads were fine, a beet salad and a caesar salads, both of ample size and, as I said, fine.</li><li>Getting fresh veggies and fruits from Berries &amp; Blooms became a twice a week habit during my last two semesters at York U. I used to frequent the old sandwich/salad/frozen yogurt place that used to be beside BMO because they had affordable salads and fruit smoothies, so I was pretty upset when they closed down during the York Lanes renovation.</li><li>There 's a good selection of healthy foods, including quinoa, couscous, tuna, broccoli, salads and a wide assortment of fruits.</li><li>Makes me wonder what they 're doing when they make their salads.</li><li>Their salads are not bad at all and you gotta weigh it accurately because if you do n't choose wisely your bill will be higher than expected!</li><li>Listen, their sashimi is fresh as always, the sushi is always on point, the cooked items are flavored to perfection, and the salads are better than most.</li><li>I have also had the soups and salads which are delicious and home made.</li><li>The salads are fairly basic ( which means mixed mache greens) with options for standard or greek styled salads.</li><li>Any left over Ace baguette in my house get turned into delicious croutons for snacks or salads.</li><li>I personally thought the way the salads were presented was beautiful. really fresh fish for its low price. this sushi resaurant is actually one of the oldest in north york area since 1999 ( ? im pretty sure) when u enter, sushi bar greets u with irashaimasen and ur immediately seated by a waitress or waiter. hot green tea is usually given as soon as you seat down and after you order, some free edamame and tofu comes out. then u get the food u ordered ( fast) and ur tea is never emptied bc of the constant refill and quality checks. the place is old but i looks neat.</li><li>They have a good selection of European products, salads, spreads, fish, fruit and vegetables.</li><li>Being a deli, they serve other foods like salads, homemade dumplings, blinis, herring in cream or wine sauce and even schmaltz!</li><li>They have an extensive menu consisting of pizza 's, pastas, sandwiches, salads and appetizers.</li><li>The soups and salads are always fresh and have that home made flavour.</li><li>Various salads and small side items, I recommend the pickles.</li><li>You grab your cold salads, order your sandwich, and proceed to the hot foods table before paying.</li><li>You also have all the other standards: scoops of tuna and egg, cream cheese, salads, lox, and BAGELS!</li><li>She gave us extra lobster, extra lobster bisque, extra salads, extra dessert at the end.</li><li>Waited almost an hour for 2 salads.</li><li>Got our drink when the salads were ready.</li><li>The all day breakfast is excellent, and the salads and take out still are good.</li><li>Pastas &amp; salads are just fine.</li><li>An a dish with 3 types of salads.</li><li>The pitas and salads are great.</li><li>The salads here were okay to be honest, nothing here is really that fresh though, be warned!</li><li>Not much healthy food but they have a couple salads which are n't bad ( if you avoid the muffin/cake thing they give you with it).</li><li>They serve your basic sandwiches, a variety of salads, and a good selection of soups.</li><li>The bread is very fresh, as well as the salads.</li><li>Menu selection is limited to soup, sandwiches, salads, and desserts ( possibly also breakfast), but everything I 've ever ordered here has been good.</li><li>The salads and sweets are pretty delicious but when it comes to entrees or main dishes most of what they offer is dry, blend, looks and tastes old.</li><li>They have burritos, bowls, tacos, nacho platters, salads, and vegetarian options.</li><li>Sandwiches, pizza, made to order, salads, chicken, fish, rice balls, espressos and a full bar.</li><li>Never tried Wimpys diner before but its a typical diner with all day breakfast menu and burgers, salads, pastas.</li><li>Simple menu consisting of Italian style sandwiches, salads, and coffees.</li><li>We order greek salads, which are good, as well as the spicy fries which are definitely frozen and completely delicious- I 've got a soft spot for frozen potatoes.</li><li>Both dinners came with generous portions of veggies and salads that have an `` in house'' dressing that is so good they should sell it for take home!</li><li>I usually do n't like salads but the `` ME salad'' was exceptionally great and the ingredients complimented each other well.</li><li>Awesome fish ( rainbow trout,) delicious sides, salads, yogurts, eggplant dishes, and who can forget the freshly baked bread.</li><li>They pack the pita generously with lots of falafel balls and different salads.</li><li>$ 40- $ 65, salads $ 15- $ 20, sushi $ 20 + the dinner adds up quickly.</li><li>The only saving grace is that they do serve salads.</li><li>We ordered some rolls ( avocado, unagi- Caterpillar, and mixed fish- Atlantic), the extra small sashimi party platter that comes with miso soups and green salads ( which we upgraded for $ 2.70 fee each to wakame salad), and a BBQ beef short ribs appetizer ( kalbi).</li><li>The upgrade charge on the salads was frankly disappointing, since I look at their menu and the green salads and wakame salads are actually both priced at $ 4.95.</li><li>The upgrade charge on the salads was frankly disappointing, since I look at their menu and the green salads and wakame salads are actually both priced at $ 4.95.</li><li>Have n't really tried anything but their salads in their buffet section of the menu.</li><li>Their salads are good.</li><li>They have a buffet style section for some small foods ( apps, salads, desserts), think Mandarin kinda deal.</li><li>I feel like the salads are n't very fresh: ( Also, I find that every time I 'm there, I always feel rushed by the waiters because they constantly remind me they close at 3 and we need to finish eating soon.</li><li>They serve a decent variety of bagels, salads, and omelettes.</li><li>Soups and salads here are among the best in Toronto.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
