this place is soo expensive. the dinner bento box is almost $ 20. the service is good and the food is great but the prices just arent worth it, at all. there are so many places in this area that are much more reasonable with the same quality food. the ambiance is really nice, which is probably why the prices are so high ... i probably wouldnt visit again. i 'd recommend for people with money to spare lol.</li><li>From what I can tell, the prices are slightly higher than average, but so are the portion sizes.</li><li>To sum it all up: Sushi Moto is a large, busy sushi joint ( run by Koreans) serving up pretty good food at reasonable prices in a modern, contemporary setting with pretty good service to boot.</li><li>The prices were really decent too.</li><li>Amazing sushi selection, at very reasonable prices!</li><li>Decor is nice, and prices are high to match.</li><li>One of the best places for dates, affordable prices and good service.</li><li>The prices are moderate.</li><li>Is it perfect, not, but close to given the prices.</li><li>The prices are reasonable.</li><li>I thought it was going to be superrrr expensive however the prices were reasonable.</li><li>Overall, I really enjoyed the meal and the prices were reasonable.</li><li>And yes the prices have moved upward.</li><li>Prices are very reasonable for the service and quality of the food.</li><li>While the decor and ambience is pleasant, the prices are not indicative of the quality of the food.</li><li>Their prices are a bit moderate but split between two people, you usually come out about $ 15 a person ..</li><li>Found the prices to be quite high for the relatively small portions.</li><li>And their prices are a bit high when you consider quality and cost of what they served, and for this type of restaurant the portions are not huge.</li><li>I would much rather go to the Mr. Greek on East Beaver Creek for this type of fare at the same prices with very good food.</li><li>Prices are reasonable and while the decor is n't anything fancy, the place has a comfortable family feel.</li><li>The prices looked fair so I decided to go in.</li><li>All the prices are written on the display glass, so even if you do n't know what it is and want to try, you wo n't be surprised when it hits the register!</li><li>Prices are a little high for the food.</li><li>There is also a patio and a McDonald 's right across if you want a cheap meal right after these amazing drink prices!</li><li>Solid take out place- fast, good quality fare at decent prices!</li><li>Every dish is good and comes with impressive portion and low prices.</li><li>Portions are massive with great prices.</li><li>Very good comfort food at good prices.</li><li>Food was great, service was great, and prices were very reasonable.</li><li>Decent food and decent prices.</li><li>Great service and reasonable prices.</li><li>It had a surprisingly large menu and the prices were n't too pricey, but I would n't consider it as cheap either.</li><li>Good service, Love the giant tea pot .reasonable prices.</li><li>The portions are on the slightly smaller side for your typical Korean fare and the prices are on the higher end of the spectrum I would say.</li><li>Prices are reasonable and the portion of food is modest.</li><li>The prices are slightly higher than other Korean restaurants.</li><li>Their prices has increased over the years, and the quality and portion of the food has gone down.</li><li>Prices are a bit higher than the korean places on yonge st. Hope they expand their menu later.</li><li>Portions are big and prices are reasonable.</li><li>Prices are reasonable ... but I would gladly pay more because the flavours are awesome!</li><li>And as a side note, the prices are decently priced.</li><li>You may not mind `` some extra protein'' at such good prices and quick service but I wo n't go back.</li><li>Very cheap prices and large portion, thats a plus! so whats so great about Shawarma Max ?</li><li>Anyway, the prices were I guess average at $ 5 for 2 spring rolls and $ 8-10 for entrees.</li><li>So first of all, since I 'm cheap, the prices are great.</li><li>We both had better for cheaper prices.</li><li>However, I was n't expecting much out of this breakfast experience considering the low prices.</li><li>Regrettably the prices do not reflect the sizes.</li><li>To be fair, the prices are about what rotis generally cost elsewhere in the city but everywhere else, the rotis were twice the size.</li><li>Prices are a tad bit high for this type of food, but you get what you pay for.</li><li>Prices are comparable to other roti shops.</li><li>The prices are excellent as well.</li><li>I would gladly pay more even if they increase their prices.</li><li>Decent portions and good prices.</li><li>Their prices are good too.</li><li>Most notably, the prices are increasing rapidly yet portions and quality are the same.</li><li>The best sichuan restaurant in Toronto easily and at very good prices.</li><li>Surprised they have n't franchised this place yet but glad the prices are reasonable.</li><li>Fast friendly and reasonable prices.</li><li>Great prices.</li><li>As always cheap prices for a large portion of food.</li><li>I personally prefer eating their vermicelli dishes over the pho but regardless of what you order; 90% of the time you will not be disappointed. everything is amazing and prices are super good, best pho in toronto! dont listen to me, just go try it yourself: D.</li><li>All of the food is great with great portions and prices are reasonable.</li><li>Good food, the interior is n't the best although the good prices and even better deals make up for it.</li><li>A final note: the prices at Sorento 's seem a bit askew.</li><li>The prices are quite reasonable and their portions are more than adequate!</li><li>The prices were decent for Toronto, although perhaps a little high given the location and the quality.</li><li>Very reasonable prices and flavorful food !!</li><li>The prices are good and the staff is friendly.</li><li>Food was good, prices reasonable.</li><li>Prices were reasonable.</li><li>Great atmosphere, great food, good service ( service level dropped a little bit through out our meal), and prices are not bad for what you get !!</li><li>The prices are a bit on the higher end, but it was an overall pleasant dining experience.</li><li>The prices were very high and more on a par with a top notch downtown restaurant; they are certainly not reflective of the food or service at the Miller.</li><li>At these prices, there are lots of far superior restaurants around.</li><li>Sadly, the Miller 's fries are outclassed by the Pilot 's, Caplansky 's and the Stockyards, all of which offer comparable burgers at lower prices.</li><li>Prices are reasonable.</li><li>The decor was modern and classy with reasonable prices.</li><li>Simple menu and reasonable prices compared to most steakhouses out here- it 's a solid 3/5.</li><li>I do think that the prices are little too high, but the restaurant is very beautiful and I love the vibe there.</li><li>The fish was amazing, portions are huge and prices are very reasonable, especially for how good it was.</li><li>My only concerns were that my chicken teriyaki was slightly dry and the prices were relatively steep.</li><li>The prices are definitely reasonable for lunch specials, averaging around $ 10.</li><li>I forgot the prices but I think this is my favorite for spicy salmon rolls.</li><li>The prices here are a little steep, but it 's worth it.</li><li>If you 're price conscious, they have lunch specials offered at slightly better prices ( $ 12 +).</li><li>When you consider that a lot of upscale sushi places are charging you an arm and a leg for superficial reasons, it actually makes the prices here seem worthwhile.</li><li>Prices are a little more than average but it 's because the quality is so much better.</li><li>Anyways, its not the best indian food, its not the worst worst, but the prices are expensive.</li><li>The prices could be a little cheaper with better lunch deals.</li><li>Good food and good prices!</li><li>The `` regular'' ( realistically HUGE) portions for $ 2 more is a massive plate and good enough for two large meals ( I do believe the prices on the website are outdated).</li><li>The menu itself is pretty decent, lots of choices standard fare like burgers, steak frites, sandwiches .... prices were really good too.</li><li>Overall, Baton Rouge provides a more upscale and intimate dining experience ( compared to Jack Astors/Moxies/Joey 's), but at almost the same prices.</li><li>Prices were reasonable and portion sizes were decent.</li><li>Good prices but the Koobideh Kabab has a certain smell to it that can be a bit overwhelming ...</li><li>Reasonable prices, I recommend to everyone.</li><li>Good quality food, good prices and great quantities.</li><li>Prices were reasonable.</li><li>Prices are reasonable, their weekday lunch specials = dinner menu but $ 1 cheaper.</li><li>I 'm a regular at another Jimmy the Greek location and I noticed that the prices at Fairview are different.</li><li>I 'm not sure if that 's because the prices at my usual location are lower, or if the prices at Fairview are higher.</li><li>But this was decent food with good portions &amp; prices.</li><li>The prices are a little high, but the portions are generous and the service is- well, frankly a lot friendlier than a deli should be.</li><li>Prices are reasonable.</li><li>The prices are also very fair and the environment is also super friendly.</li><li>Prices are comparable.</li><li>Fresh fish, genuinely attentive service, and a great atmosphere, all at affordable prices.</li><li>Excellent prices, great food- cant ask for more.</li><li>The prices are extremely cheap but the quantity and quality is all there.</li><li>And the prices are extremely low.</li><li>The quality is on par with a fast food sandwich place and the prices are low.</li><li>Prices are very fair.</li><li>With the food, prices, and ambiance, this is definitely a welcome addition to the area being that there is n't much around here to get too excited about.</li><li>The prices were n't bad. and I liked that you could order yourself a nice little mezze of only the things you like- most of the time in other restaurants you have to order a platter with specific items on it.</li><li>For one thing, the prices are great.</li><li>Prices are reasonable.</li><li>Nothing fancy about it ( butter in packets), but very nice ambiance and good prices.</li><li>It is a great asset to the Don Mills area, selling delicious food for good prices while not relying on pretentious decor or hosts.</li><li>You can find all the typical Cantonese dishes at good prices ( $ 7 and up) and the portion is good for small group.</li><li>The food is decent to pretty good and the prices are OK as well.</li><li>The place is nothing fancy to look at but who cares when the food tastes this good and prices are so reasonable.</li><li>It is an unprepossessing free standing establishment that makes good and plenty basic Italian food at super reasonable prices.</li><li>I will definitely be coming back here !!! arviderci Paolo see you soon! this is a really cute place close to my neighborhood, my boyf and i decided to come here after i read some good yelp reviews ( id seen the place before but never got around to actually trying it). the service was so friendly and he gave us 2 coffees for the price of one which was very sweet. i love the decor and music, its very old-timey. i ordered a chicken sandwich and he ordered an eggplant sandwich, which is vegetarian, and they were really good, my only gripe would be that the bread is a bit dry. otherwise its a really nice little place with reasonable prices.</li><li>The prices are quite reasonable. or hip, but you can always venture downtown to a bar afterward to be seen and heard.</li><li>The prices here are quite reasonable for the quality of food you get and I will definitely be back.</li><li>I like the fact that the prices are reasonable and portion is great!</li><li>Great food with great prices!</li><li>Amazing tastes, large portions, good prices.</li><li>The prices here are very reasonable .... portion size is very generous.</li><li>Service is really quick, and portions are amazing for the prices.</li><li>The prices are reasonable with $ 5 for a small pho as an example.</li><li>If you 're expecting fine dining, this noodle house is n't the best establishment to walk into, but adequate service, good, wholesome Vietnamese cuisine and affordable prices make it a must for any pho soup fan.</li><li>COSTS The prices are fairly typical.</li><li>The prices are fair and I 'm surprised that only recently they have issued new menus and changed the prices.</li><li>The prices are fair and I 'm surprised that only recently they have issued new menus and changed the prices.</li><li>It has one of the best beef pho noodle soups in town. the prices have gone up in the last little while but still a good value.</li><li>I do n't think they have raised their prices in years which is great for customers.</li><li>The prices are reasonable and the service is fast.</li><li>With prices slightly higher than the average AYCE sushi restaurant, I expected the quality to be higher as well.</li><li>The prices are reasonable and the food is flavourful.</li><li>But they just raised their prices for lunch buffet it used to be $ 12.99 + tax now it 's $ 15.95 ( almost $ 16 + tax and tip you end up shelling out $ 20 for a mediocre AYCE.</li><li>Service is quick, efficient, prices are reasonable, the mackerel sashimi is n't partially FROZEN when brought out ( yes, that 's happened to me ...), and the tempura ...</li><li>The prices are a little high but it 's worth it if you like sashimi.</li><li>The place looks fairly nice and the prices are pretty good for lunch.</li><li>Their ayce prices are pretty high, about $ 25, but it seems like a pretty good menu.</li><li>You have to understand this was before Cott cola broke the price barrier and forced Coke and Pepsi to lower prices.</li><li>The prices are reasonable you can feed 4ppl for a little over $ 40.</li><li>But I 'm still not sure if the premium prices were completely justified at this Pho restaurant.</li><li>But then again, the prices are a lot less than if you were to go to most other type of restaurants so try this one out!</li><li>The prices here are standard with most other pho places, and there seem to be a decent amount of them around as well.</li><li>They definitely know how to cook their meats and their prices are lower.</li><li>The prices are fantastic for both the pizza and pop. For about $ 14 you can get two med pizzas worth of pure taste-bud indulgence.</li><li>The prices here are pretty good and the fact that they have every special imaginable leaves your wallet feeling pretty good.</li><li>All in all, very reasonable prices and quick service.</li><li>Felt like prices were good too.</li><li>Not to mention the prices are great!</li><li>The seafood version uses frozen seafood, so the texture is a bit lacking, but you ca n't really expect fresh at these prices.</li><li>It 's a bit if a hole in the wall but the food and prices are unbeatable!</li><li>Also reasonable prices.</li><li>You could potentially say that the prices are a touch high for Mexican food of this caliber, but the serving sizes are quite reasonable.</li><li>Flavourful, admirable prices, nice hosts, this small Mexican place serves it up well in an unassuming part of the Bathurst strip.</li><li>If you like Mexican food this is the place, good food, good prices, there beef burritos are really good.</li><li>Prices are a little bit more around $ 16-20 a plate.</li><li>I liked that it was hot ( yes, I know I said it already), noodles were a little dry but the sweetness of the preserves cabbage saved it a little bit- place was clean, service was fast ( I went around 5:30-6)- probably it was midtown, prices were jacked up 1-2 dollars compared to uptown.- overall, you 're going to a diner and this place delivered what a Chinese diner needs to be.</li><li>Nothing here is totally exceptional, IMO, but the quality 's good and the prices are reasonable.</li><li>Overall, this restaurant is your standard Chinese restaurant--fully equipped with the usual pearly white utensils and chopsticks--and the prices are cheap and affordable!</li><li>I have been to the Congee Queen location just at The Shops but it was far more crowded and the prices were more expensive.</li><li>But when we called, they told us that their prices had went up for their party trays which is fine, but they did not honour the prices they had up on the website.</li><li>Fast service, good food and cheap prices- the perfect trifecta.</li><li>The portions are generous and the prices are fair.</li><li>The food is good, but not worth the teeny portion size they give you. ... while i 've always known this place existed, it 's hard for me to remember that it 's there to try it out. located in a plaza on don mills but you ca n't really see the storefront and if you 're not looking for it you 'll drive by it completely. finally we got dinner takeout as we were searching on yelp. we ordered: live whole lobster with efu noodles- excellent. yeung chow fried rice- good, but the peas were slightly undercooked. sweet cruller rice noodle rolls, good. stir fried beef with vegetables, good. deep fried squid tentacles, good. fried turnip patties Singapore style, mediocre. sweet and sour pork, excellent. the food was great, the prices are definitely cheaper than congee queen. all of that for $ 70, and they deliver for orders over $ 25- which i did n't know until we picked up the food. love delivery, especially for the winter- will definitely return!</li><li>Congee Star offers up huge portions for not so huge prices.</li><li>Prices are reasonable and it was nice and welcoming.</li><li>Menu looked good with lots of options at good prices.</li><li>Cheap prices, and friendly staff.</li><li>The prices are a bit high 17-18 dollars for a pasta but not unusual for the Avenue road location.</li><li>The prices are a bit higher than other cafes of this nature.</li><li>Could not believe the prices!</li><li>Prices are very cheap compared to the portions you get.</li><li>Good value at reasonable prices.</li><li>They do n't have a non-alcoholic drink menu on paper, but the waitress was more than willing to let me know what they had ( although she did n't tell me the prices).</li><li>Prices are pretty good.</li><li>Very reasonable prices.</li><li>Pathetic customer service, un-eatable food, and expensive prices are what you get.</li><li>The prices are increasing yet quality is not and neither is quantity.</li><li>The prices are fairly reasonable but it 's the service, portion size, and delicious food that keep me coming back.</li><li>The prices for lunch are much higher than any other Japanese restaurant in the area, without any justification.</li><li>Have n't been here in a while because I find that the prices here are more expensive than other sushi places.</li><li>It used to be a reliable place for me to get fresh sushi ( Chirashi Sushi) at reasonable prices.</li><li>Friendly service, good food, decent prices.</li><li>The food is really good, especially the kebabs, and prices are very reasonable.</li><li>Lots of spices and herbs at good prices.</li><li>The prices are reasonable and parking is free.</li><li>Prices are reasonable but keep in mind this is K-town and you can easily get bubble tea for $ 3.99 anywhere else.</li><li>Prices are cheaper than a lot of other bubble tea places at less than $ 5 for a large drink without tax.</li><li>Not the friendliest bunch working there -- but the prices are reasonable, the European imports ( mostly from Eastern Europe) quite substantial.</li><li>Their prices are fair especially considering the quality and amount that you get.</li><li>And obviously the prices are amazing!</li><li>Tucked into the small street if Willowdale ave, this place has a non pretentious atmosphere, the food is delicious and fair prices.</li><li>We tried the following: Chicken carbonara- tasty and creamy and good sized portion Escargot in herb n tomato sauce- really good, multile pieces of escargot with bread for dipping the remaining sauce Veal mushroom- tasty as well Shirley Temple- refreshing drink Service was also friendly and efficient and prices were reasonable.</li><li>Their food is consistently good ( we get their garlic shrimp every time) and prices are reasonable.</li><li>The new owners are even better, portions are big, service is relatively quick, and prices are very reasonable.</li><li>The prices were average for Korean food, the soups/stews ranged from $ 6.99- $ 9.99 and there were also options for hot pot and table top cooking.</li><li>The prices were also extremely reasonable, compared to the place I used to frequent by Yonge and Finch ( at least half the price for table cooking!).</li><li>Great food, large portions, at very reasonable prices.</li><li>Not super cheap, but for what you get prices are definitely reasonable.</li><li>What do you get when you combine good prices, good selection, and good food ?</li><li>This family owned restaurant serves delicious food, has efficient service and great prices.</li><li>The wine list is small but respectable, and we were able to find some good selections at reasonable prices.</li><li>This is definitely not the cheapest Italian restaurant I 've been to but I think the prices are reasonable for the large portions and quality that you get.</li><li>Some of my friends of complained about the portion sizes, but then I make the comparison to the Island food chain and they kind of suck it up as the prices are almost identical in respect to portion sizes of both.</li><li>Fair prices and delicious maki.</li><li>The prices are fair and its a convienent location right at the subway station.</li><li>Open late, and the prices are pretty decent as well.</li><li>When our mains came the presentation was far from mediocre, especially given the prices.</li><li>Prices were reasonable.</li><li>Although the prices are higher than your other establishment, Salad King, I guess that 's to be expected given the nicer, more upscale dining experience.</li><li>While Salad King is a much better value, the prices at Linda are reasonable.</li><li>Decent prices decent food.</li><li>That said, the prices are fairly steep for the area, and perhaps more expensive than the food is good.</li><li>Yes the price is above average, but when the restaurant is so nicely decorated and the waiters pick every last piece of scrap that fell on the table then I can accept the higher prices- not to mention the food was awesome.</li><li>Located at Shops at Don Mills ( my new favourite mall for dining, love Joey Don Mills and Fabbrica!), it 's really quite a lovely place to enjoy a nice dinner, but the prices are considerably higher.</li><li>It was a very enjoyable meal and despite the steeper prices, I would definitely come back to eat the curry beef again.</li><li>This is one of the few places where I feel the higher prices are well justified.</li><li>The food was just mediocre for me and the prices were quite steep, as well.</li><li>Their Thai dishes are decent but like I said, the prices are a bit high for the small portion you get but very tasty.</li><li>- The ambience inside and prices were not terrible, but average at best- comparable to other Thai restaurants in the city.</li><li>Not cheap, but portion sizes justify the prices.</li><li>The prices are a bit high.</li><li>Admittedly it 's hard to have high standards overall for typical pho restaurants, but it 's pretty decent given location, food and prices.</li><li>The prices are pretty decent, would n't mind going again, but I 'll probably stick to my usual order of bun rather than pho.</li><li>A few reasons to love Mr. Jerk- great flavor- great prices ( chicken and pork combo for 10 $ that 's good enough for 2 people)- great sides ( plantains, coleslaw, and chili all mesh well together)- large servings- gravy and rice are awesome I always order take-out and the worst part of the experience is the drive home hungry while the aroma of the grilled chicken fills the car.</li><li>Prices are very cheap and do n't expect a place to sit down.</li><li>Prices were very reasonable-we each paid $ 20 including tax and tip and were stuffed to the seams at the end.</li><li>Their prices are so cheap.</li><li>Great food, decent prices, nice atmosphere, super friendly service.</li><li>Prices are very reasonable as well.</li><li>The service is fast and the prices are really reasonable for this type of restaurant.</li><li>Prices are all very fair and a great bang for your buck.</li><li>Prices are fairly reasonable given the hike under new management.</li><li>Their website has that usual disclaimer about prices subject to change.</li><li>Tekka lunch special prices is cheaper than what they posted on their website!</li><li>That was really good. not good, prices raised. went to try the silver menu and they raised the price to $ 17.</li><li>The prices are also very reasonable.</li><li>Decent sushi Somewhat pricey Sashimi cut on the thin side Freshness of fish is good Will definitely order from them again, but due to the portion sizes and prices, will probably stop for all you can eat next time.</li><li>Their prices are decent compared to other Latin places.</li><li>Delicious food and reasonable prices!</li><li>Prices are very fair.</li><li>Prices are reasonable for the portion size !!</li><li>Great portions and prices.</li><li>I was kind enough to give away a few:) Moderate prices, good food, a keeper!</li><li>Lots of choice, reasonable prices.</li><li>Great prices ...</li><li>Good prices too, our bill for two dishes and app come in just over $ 20.</li><li>Food is amazing, prices are good.</li><li>Food tastes great, they do not skim on the ingredients, portion is generous, and prices are low.</li><li>Prices are extremely reasonable.</li><li>The menus are basically the same, but the dishes taste marginally better and the prices are comparable.</li><li>Prices are reasonable and the waiters/waitresses split tips so you can get good service from pretty much any employee.</li><li>Service is quick and the foods are really reasonable prices and a lot to pick.</li><li>The prices were really reasonable for the protions too:).</li><li>The prices vary on what kind of items you want in the food.</li><li>And let 's not forget that this restaurant has the best combination of yummy food and awesome prices- I mean, no wonder you see so many large groups here.</li><li>They do have a few saving graces: excellent food, super prices and TONS of high chairs.</li><li>I 've been coming here for a few years with the family and it 's always been good HK Cantonese food with very reasonable prices.</li><li>Prices are very reasonable with generous portions.</li><li>Quick service, large portions, tasty dishes ( MSG) and cheap prices!</li><li>The staff are friendly and the prices are fair ( $ 10/person will get you a good meal).</li><li>The atmosphere is more clean, and the prices are about the same and depending on the item possibly cheaper.</li><li>The quality has gone waaaay downhill and prices have gone way up.</li><li>Honestly, if you were to catch up with a friend or hang out with a group of friends, hit a cafe or a coffee shop where the prices are much lower and the service and environment are tenfolds better than places like here.</li><li>This is the go-to place for lunch for a few folks in the office and I. The lunch offerings are typically Korean ( bibimbap, various jjigae, and some bulgogee sets) and the prices are right.</li><li>The prices were not worth the meal.</li><li>The prices are also about average for the area.</li><li>They recently raised the prices a bit but still reasonable for the soups.</li><li>First impression of the menu: cheap prices relative to its competitors.</li><li>The selection is pretty standard, but the prices were fair.</li><li>Their portions are huge and prices and extremely affordable.</li><li>The prices are really good too.</li><li>The prices here are real cheap and the quality of service is great.</li><li>Not exactly THE best sushi, but for the price you get quite a bit and the prices are huge.</li><li>Have you seen their prices ?</li><li>Their prices are great considering the quantity, but I 'm sad to say that the quality has gone down quite a bit in recent years.</li><li>I have no complaints, they 're fast, and also the prices are very decent

pretty good but the prices were outrageous: $ 15 for a hand roll !?!</li><li>If the fish was fresh, I might have felt a little better about the prices.</li><li>Stepping in, you can tell it 's one of those pretentious places w/ nice decor &amp; ambiance which simply means ... we look authentic &amp; can jack up prices &amp; even more so since it 's part of the Westin Prince Hotel.</li><li>The food is priced at more upscale prices, but their food is extremely good.</li><li>Prices are higher here than the Korean and Chinese operated sushi restaurants that dominate the GTA scene now, but that 's
