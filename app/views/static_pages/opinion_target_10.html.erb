<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 10' %><h2>portions<br />occurrence: 511</h2><div><ol><li>I 've been to some really nice Indian places downtown that have the exact same pricing but much nicer decor and slightly bigger portions.</li><li>Service is ok, but considering we 're the only patrons, I 'd expect a little more. just to let you know we drive all the way from Brampton, just to go to this place whicj is in scarborough. the middle eastern food is awesome, the portions are a good size and the prices are dirt cheap, small swarma dinner for under $ 8 per person, falafels are good and there hot wings are soooooo hot for $ 5o bucks four people will be stuffed as they give you free appetizers, hot peppers, beets, olives and pitas.</li><li>Overall A OK considering the price and portions.</li><li>Best all you can eat with great portions and very fresh sushi.</li><li>Plus take-out portions seem bigger than dine-in.</li><li>The portions were a great size and perfect for sharing!</li><li>The dumplings here are gigantic, as are their portions.</li><li>Large portions, good food, and friendly service!</li><li>Food that is cooked here basically come in generic portions, and is mediocre at best.</li><li>The portions are fair, but the taste could use some work and the prices are a little high.</li><li>Food is delicious and portions are a good size.</li><li>But the food .. huge portions ( good for student budgets!)</li><li>MAJORLY overpriced, tiny portions, tasteless ramen ... worse than instant noodles.</li><li>No the portions are n't comparable to the cheesecake factory.</li><li>Their food is just ok and their portions are tiny.</li><li>However the past two times I 've been there the portions have been cheap.</li><li>Food is homey and delicious and reasonably priced with very generous portions.</li><li>Absolutely consistent in quality and portions Great Osso Bucco.</li><li>My problem is that the portions are small, and the prices are a little more expensive than usual.</li><li>They tasted fine and the rice with the Chirasu was quite good, but the portions were disappointing.</li><li>Food portions were TINY and prices are high ... ( i speak of the ala carte menu not AYCE) came in on a near empty Wednesday night ... promptly seated .. then that was it .. they litterally just forgot about us .. no tea no menu .. they just went to the back and dissapeared for a good 13 minutes or so .. cant even wave anyone down. when we finally got the menu, anything remotely resembling a deal cannot be used with the groupon ... ( ALL bento boxes) so i ordered a chirashi.</li><li>Meaning that the portions are controlled.</li><li>I go to buffets for variety so I appreciate the small portions.</li><li>The portions shrunk, but I can live with it since I went with the AYCE menu.</li><li>It was exactly what I wanted and the portions were massive.</li><li>Very pricey, small portions, and only adequate food.</li><li>The kids got the teriyaki chicken dinner and it was actually great for $ 10 you get a miso soup ( personally found it too salty), chicken teriyaki and rice and the portions were pretty decent.</li><li>Everything was really delicious, seasoned well, generous portions for sharing.</li><li>The first time my brother 's girlfriend took me here I was so impressed with how FRESH &amp; GENEROUS the portions are.</li><li>The food was also surprisingly good, and portions are unusually generous: The salmon sashimi lunch actually has enough pieces to not leave you still hungry yet does n't cost an arm and a leg, the bento box was varied and tasted good, and when I tried the kalbi dinner, the plate was stacked with so many large pieces that it puts to shame most other kalbi entrees I 've tried.</li><li>The portions were very generous and the price was quite affordable.</li><li>But the price is a little high, specially for dinner, even though I admit the portions are larger than average of other sushi places.</li><li>The latter was my favourite- the portions are plentiful and although I wish there was more shrimp tempura included ( rather than the veggie tempura) I was satisfied overall.</li><li>For lots of truckers come here they have big portions to satisfy any belly.</li><li>The portions are not huge but they measure up to other Italian eateries that would charge up to $ 20 for a similar plate.</li><li>Although the portions do n't seem large, the amount of protein and carbs you get from the healthy serving of rice and meat, fills you up a lot faster than you originally think.</li><li>Back to the food, the portions are somewhat on the larger side, but mostly filled with rice.</li><li>Their portions are very good.</li><li>The doner are perfect, never over or undercooked and in large portions, be it as a plate or a sandwich.</li><li>I used to love this restaurant because the portions were large, generous amount of meat &amp; rich flavouring.</li><li>I highly recommend the Neptune Salad or the Greek Salad ( if you order a large, the portions are very generous) with a warm pita.</li><li>Found the prices to be quite high for the relatively small portions.</li><li>The first 2 times were great- food was delicious, decent portions, and good staff.</li><li>The first thing I did is take a sip of the soup and the broth tasted very good was actually very impressed with the soup broth. it was definitely very good and the portions for good had a lot of meat and I strongly recommend that anybody that 's in that area to make their way to this restaurant because it was a pleasant surprise.</li><li>Decent size portions.</li><li>You get more bang for your buck here as the portions are very kind.</li><li>Some of the items and portions are different from what you might expect- the chow mein comes with fourteen pounds of bell peppers and onions, and one order of deep fried won tons could easily kill a family of four- but this is definitely the best Chinese in the neighborhood.</li><li>If you come for breakfast you get the same gargantuan portions you get for lunch or dinner.</li><li>All the food our group ordered was very good, and large portions.</li><li>The portions are on the slightly smaller side for your typical Korean fare and the prices are on the higher end of the spectrum I would say.</li><li>Decent prices and portions.</li><li>The portions were also very small.</li><li>Big portions Great tasting food Their beef dishes melt in your mouth too!</li><li>On the plus side, the dishes were very warm and the portions were huge.</li><li>Staff is helpful and friendly, and portions are very generous!</li><li>The bimbimbap was loaded with veggies and beef, the portions are bigger than any other Korean restaurant we have been to.</li><li>Everything is a bit pricier because it 's kosher, but the portions and taste make it all worth it.</li><li>The portions are great!</li><li>Great price and huge portions.</li><li>Good portions, definitely will come here again.</li><li>Things that are normal:* there will be a line, it will be less bad than you 're worried about* portions are diet-smashingly huge* there is a lot of fruit It 's a good addition to a relatively dire set of brunch options in the area, and I 'm a sucker for brunch.</li><li>That said, the food is always good, the portions are ginormous, and once you actually get seated the waitstaff is helpful and sweet.</li><li>The portions are hearty so if you are really hungry and want a decent price then come here.</li><li>The portions size was incredible and it 's tough to finish this all in one sitting.</li><li>The portions are huge!</li><li>The portions are very generous ( and definitely worth the price).</li><li>The food came in fairly large portions, especially the banana crepe ( we added strawberries to it, too).</li><li>Cora offers a fabulous breakfast &amp; lunch menu and huge portions.</li><li>It was actually an item off the Teen menu so I was a bit scared the portions were going to be tiny bit I could n't even finish my meal.</li><li>Really not much to nit pick at here- portions are very generous and the chicken is tasty.</li><li>It 's tasty and the portions are huge.</li><li>The portions were great so that our family ended up finishing everything that we ordered.</li><li>All portions are super small, some are bigger for sharing, but most of the Mains are only good enough for one or two people.</li><li>The service was quick and efficient, and the portions were good.</li><li>Great portions!</li><li>They have generous portions of chicken and potatoes in a nice thin roti.</li><li>No MSG, large portions and it arrives fresh from the Wok.</li><li>Decent portions and good prices.</li><li>Very good portions.</li><li>The portions are huge, but the pho is filled with MSG.</li><li>The portions are well sized like most vietnamese pho restaurants.</li><li>This restaurant deserves one extra star because their portions are unusually large compared to many competitors for the same price.</li><li>Personally I find La Prep to be somewhat overpriced but, eh, we live in a fast casual food world and this one is located in York University where the food seems to always be slightly more expensive or the portions slightly smaller than the same chain elsewhere.</li><li>Kids wolfed it down quickly so while the portions are pretty big like another yelper noted, I seriously think the our boys aged 5, 8, 11 could have order their own.</li><li>The food is amazing, big portions and full of flavour.</li><li>The portions are freaking huge and the food is delicious.</li><li>Both were really good portions and hit the spot right for us.</li><li>I got a large bowl of special beef noodles, and the broth was really tasty and the portions of meat were huge!</li><li>All of the food is great with great portions and prices are reasonable.</li><li>Great portions and great value for your money.</li><li>The prices are quite reasonable and their portions are more than adequate!</li><li>The portions are pretty good here.</li><li>Prices have gone up and the portions have in fact decreased, even though the menu is still the same.</li><li>Everyone enjoyed their mains and the generous portions.</li><li>Portion- regular sized portions.</li><li>Food is good, however I found the portions to be extremely small, especially for the price being paid !!</li><li>Fresh, hearty portions that are full of flavour.</li><li>Really great for a night out or for families, great portions and the food was delicious.</li><li>The portions was ok, both times we got great slices of bread to go with our pasta.</li><li>The fish was amazing, portions are huge and prices are very reasonable, especially for how good it was.</li><li>The portions were more than generous, and the rolls had a great rice to filling ratio.</li><li>Also had the maki rolls which were very big portions and also good.</li><li>The portions seemed smaller than other places however.</li><li>For the price you pay the portions are n't great.</li><li>The quality has gone down because their dishes are more watered down now and they giving miserly portions of vegetables/chicken with lots and lots of rice.</li><li>Above and beyond just being generous with their portions, they also offer a larger variety of fresh toppings compared to your typical shawarma places.</li><li>Big portions Actually fresh and tender chicken Get the diner plate Friendly dude that service.</li><li>Great food and big portions.</li><li>Very large portions.</li><li>This place has one of the best chicken and beef skewers in the area; very juicy and large portions.</li><li>The portions are huge, this is definitely the better location compared to the one at Richmond Hill.</li><li>I think his feeling pressured since every time we go out to eat I make him look like a little girl with my superhuman portions.</li><li>The portions here are enormous, which makes their prices reasonable.</li><li>They had really large portions and the food was great.</li><li>If you 're looking for healthy, this may not be the way to go: the portions are big and the sides are greasy.</li><li>Food quality and portions were disappointing.</li><li>Prices are good for the portions.</li><li>I like to come here when I 'm in the mood for Chinese take out as the portions are good for sharing.</li><li>Great food and massive portions!</li><li>I GIVE this restaurant 4/5 only because their portions are small for the price plus they hate to give you salad and chatny according to the number of people who will be sharing it ( By the way it is same with all the desi restaurants) Apart from this, let 's talk about positive things.</li><li>The food is amazing, great portions and well priced.</li><li>Even though I now no longer work in North York and live downtown I 'll still make a special trip to eat here sometimes, best Gormeh Sabzi I 've had in the city and the pricing and portions are amazing ... rather eat here than a lot of Persian places DT.</li><li>For the price, portions were very large.</li><li>But this was decent food with good portions &amp; prices.</li><li>The prices are a little high, but the portions are generous and the service is- well, frankly a lot friendlier than a deli should be.</li><li>Fast service the food is always fresh and delicious they can make anything on the menu just the way you like it and the portions are just perfect for sharing so you can order multiple items to share.</li><li>The portions are pretty big so there is always some to take home.</li><li>The portions of the main courses seemed to be a little smaller than the other locations.</li><li>The server failed to bring bread to the table and the portions were much smaller than the other locations.</li><li>The portions are huge, a large one can feed an elephant.</li><li>Cozy, quaint, authentic, great service and lunch specials with good portions and also licensed so you can enjoy a glass if wine or beer!</li><li>Healthy, hearty portions served by a couple who clearly love what they do.</li><li>Both meals were delicious &amp; portions were somewhat big.</li><li>Not too greasy like someplaces and the portions are well sized.</li><li>The pasta dishes are way over priced for what you get ( in terms of quality, portions sizes are decent) Very poor service.</li><li>I 'd definitely go back to this restaurant again to try out their other menu items. family owned italian restaurant. short summary: very yummy food, portions could be bigger, sometimes slow service but very friendly lady owner, always packed at lunch, which is frustrating since they dont accept reservations. longer summary: the decoration of the restaurant is very cozy and gives a feeling of a patio dining even though it 's all indoors. the service though slow is very friendly and we often end up chatting with the owner for few minutes while we 're waiting for the order. it usually gets very packed at lunch by the people from surrounding office buildings. and since they do n't accept reservations sometimes it means that you have to arrive right after the doors are open ( which is 1130am everyday I think) in general very welcoming place but a bit on a pricey side.</li><li>Prices much too high for the size of the portions which are on the small side.compared to other Chinese restaurants.</li><li>We always order enough dishes to have leftovers for the next day ... but ordering the same amount of food from Sun Star left us with no leftovers because of the small portions.</li><li>One thing to note is the portions here are a little smaller.</li><li>The portions were huge, and we did n't think we could finish it all, but because it was so tasty, we finished it all off.</li><li>Sure there were only six reviews at the time, but the common theme was 1) Excellent Phlip food and 2) ginormous portions.</li><li>The food was the best Filipino food I 've had in such a long time .... better than Remely 's or Max 's. the price is affordable and the portions humongous.</li><li>Amazing tastes, large portions, good prices.</li><li>Was making rounds at tables to make sure everything was ok) with huge portions for cheap!</li><li>Service is really quick, and portions are amazing for the prices.</li><li>The portions were ginormous and we had enough leftovers for a meal each between the two of us.</li><li>Do n't let the medium fool you, the portions are HUGE!</li><li>The portions are big and well priced.</li><li>Pros:- Best Pho in GTA- Great prices, huge portions ( I dare you skinny people to finish an XL pho without feeling sick aftewards)- One of the very few places that serve Banh Cuon- Little to no MSG in the pho soup yet still one of the best Cons:- Franchised locations do not live up to the quality of this location which I think is the original.</li><li>Ordered size small but portions were generous.</li><li>Delicious and generous portions!</li><li>The portions were so small for the price that was charged.</li><li>The variety of food is average with reasonably sized portions.</li><li>Individual portions of noodles, soups and chicken teriyaki.</li><li>They also reduced some of our order portions and forgot a few rolls, but this is typical for ayce sushi places.</li><li>Good food, fast service, nice portions ...</li><li>I really like the fact the portions are not to big, so you get to try a little bit of everything without wasting so much food.</li><li>The portions are small, which is a good thing if you want to try something for the first time.</li><li>The way they brought it was ridiculous, tiny portions at a time, so the lunch we had took about twice as long as it should have.</li><li>The portions were huge and we had a whole box of noodles to pack home along with half a bowl of the kare kare.</li><li>The portions are quite large as well, and we had plenty of leftovers.</li><li>Every dish that we have tried here has been delicious and the price is good as well as very big portions you will most likely have left overs to take home.</li><li>Reasonable prices, good portions, fresh and delicious every time.</li><li>While the portions to vary from server to server ( and I mean it varies by A LOT), if you can look past that it is n't bad for what you pay.</li><li>The portions were pretty big and neither of us could finish even though we wanted to.</li><li>The portions are huge and food does n't taste like its the same sauce with different meat.</li><li>I was very impressed with the generous portions of meat included in the dinner.</li><li>While the portions were n't huge- it was just enough food to fill you up without putting you into a coma.</li><li>The portions are great and good to share with a group!</li><li>Hungarian food has fallen out of favour with health conscious people, With good reason, the portions are enormous and heavy on the meat and grease.</li><li>The breading is so light and the portions are great.</li><li>The food comes with generous portions, and the food itself is really tasty.</li><li>However this quaint little restaurant had amazing flavor, good service and huge portions.</li><li>I 'm not a shy girl about finishing my plate but the portions were so big I just could n't even though I tried.</li><li>The food has been extra delicious, and the portions seem to have increased significantly.</li><li>Highly recommend, ca n't wait to go back and try more things. i enjoy this restaurant every time i go. the portions are well sized, the service is always polite and on time, and i 've never had any problems with the food. there are plenty of dinner options, and every time i go, it 's always consistently good. i especially like their bean spread, i find it delicious. the place itself is really small, but i do n't mind because there 's always a table available.</li><li>The portions are large and the quality was not compromised by the quantity.</li><li>If you know what to expect at most Chinese restaurants you will be happy this place fits the fold for cheap and sizeable portions.</li><li>Good portions with the right price!</li><li>The portions are generous and the prices are fair.</li><li>The last 3 times we got Congee Star ( since they have gotten their new chef), the portions have been cut in almost HALF and the price is the SAME.</li><li>The portions are huge and when you 're in a carbo-loading mood, this place definitely hits the spot!</li><li>Congee Star offers up huge portions for not so huge prices.</li><li>The menu is as large as the place and the portions.</li><li>The portions are BIG, just the way I like it, and the bill was pretty decent- I think for all that between 5 people we paid around $ 65.</li><li>I usually assume chain places will have crappy portions but I was pleasantly surprised.</li><li>Good portions.</li><li>Mediocre food, portions were smaller than usually, u have to add cheese, ramen and rice cake, do n't bother getting the rice add ones We waited 30mins for our food to come and they would n't give us our side dishes until our meal came ......</li><li>Huge portions that are so delicious you wish you can finish it all.</li><li>The portions were good sized and reasonably priced.</li><li>I ca n't speak for my fellow diners but everyone seemed to enjoy their order and the portions were generous but not ridiculous.</li><li>The only thing worse than the people working at this store is the horrible food and portions they serve.</li><li>Any way, I was happy leaving it smelled great ( i got take out) when i got home, The portions were small I got the 9.99 lunch special, Very small.</li><li>The portions are smaller, fish is not as fresh.</li><li>The only reason I took off one star in my rating was because the portions were a little bit small for the price.</li><li>The portions for all the mains were pretty small, so we definitely needed that appetizer.</li><li>The portions were good for sharing and we were at a comfortable ' full' level once we were done.</li><li>Staff were friendly and helpful and the portions are large and filling.</li><li>When it come to italian food i expect using lots of fresh ingrediants specially hand roll pastas but when i get dry one i 'm not happy, the portions are so bigand the price is good for the quality, i tried the meat lasagna which comes with ricotta cheese instead of bechamel sauce and all the foods were bland: ( The servers wasnt around when you needed them.</li><li>BTW, the portions here looks huge!</li><li>While it was decent and the portions were large it did n't blow me away.</li><li>The portions were huge so our hunger was satisfied with just one pasta or pizza dish each.</li><li>The menu is large and varied, and the portions are very generous.</li><li>Their portions are as big as your ass ( if you have a big ass), so definitely you will not leave hungry.</li><li>Everything tastes pretty great especially the pork and squid thing and the portions are pretty massive.</li><li>Instead I go to the Korean restaurant diagonally across from it which is very good and has consistent good portions.</li><li>The portions were great and we were stuffed after, I 'd come back again.</li><li>The new owners are even better, portions are big, service is relatively quick, and prices are very reasonable.</li><li>~ $ 60 special ( that supposedly feeds 5 ..... i had a party of 3: D) consisted of:- pork belly barbeque ( generous portions; fat was able to drip off so it was n't overwhelming)- mussel soup- choice of 1 bottle of sake or 5 bottles of beer- fish stew- buckwheat noodles- the usual table full of side dishes- ( complimentary sample of assorted meats &amp; blood sausage) so. bomb.</li><li>Do n't know if it was because it was a set meal, but the portions were sizeable and there was plenty to go around.</li><li>Great food, large portions, at very reasonable prices.</li><li>Huge portions, all made with good ingredients.</li><li>Everything I 've had is very delicious, very well priced, and large portions.</li><li>The portions were generous, and we were full by the end of dinner!</li><li>Family style korean restaurant with a fairly standard food selection, large portions and good taste.</li><li>The portions were extremely generous and I found all the dishes above average when it came to taste in comparison to Korean restaurants with similar menus ( which are a lot of them).</li><li>Service is impeccable and the portions are large.</li><li>It ` a $ 40 gigantic dish to share which had generous portions of mussels, squid, clams, shrimps ... and KING CRAB!</li><li>This is definitely not the cheapest Italian restaurant I 've been to but I think the prices are reasonable for the large portions and quality that you get.</li><li>The food was excellent and the portions were good.</li><li>Great atmosphere, great service and very good portions.</li><li>The portions were great and delicious.</li><li>I felt the portions could be slightly bigger for the curry dishes.</li><li>The winterlicious portions were tiny, like the appetizer said chicken skewers but 1 chicken skewer was on the plate ...</li><li>Much better portions too.</li><li>We found the portions to be quite small, especially for the fish dishes, which were quite small with mostly bone and not much to eat.</li><li>Not only did they NOT have Siam noodles, the service was snail paced slow, the waitress forgot our water and our spring rolls, the portions vs price were underwhelming and the experience was tasteless and expensive.</li><li>Their portions are also extremely generous.</li><li>One of the reasons I like Salad King is because their portions were very good for their price.</li><li>The portions are pretty good, we finished everything and were all stuffed.</li><li>The chicken satay was good, nothing was out of the extraordinary and the portions quite small.</li><li>Thai iced tea was n't the greatest either. after eating dinner at Linda, s modern thai last night, I would not refer anyone who like, s good thai food to go there.the food is plan, and the portions are very small, well the price, s are high. dinner with two dish, s and a small salad was around seventy five dollar, s.we had to pick up food on the way home as we were still not full.there are so many better thai place, s in Toronto.</li><li>For dessert, the portions are smaller for their prices, but a good selection of choices.</li><li>At this price it is higher than most Chinese BBQ joints but as long as the quality is there and the portions are large then you really do get your moneys worth here.</li><li>We were seated quickly and ordered two bowls of pho. and well ...- the portions were tiny- there was barely any beef in your pho- it is expensive- the pho was n't that good After we paid the bill, the staff never gave us back change.</li><li>The food was ok but the portions were small.</li><li>Always huge portions.</li><li>I honestly will need to make more trips to see how the rest of the menu is as the portions are way too large to order multiple dishes for sampling!</li><li>Reasonable prices and good portions.</li><li>The food is great, the vegetarian options plentiful, the service friendly, the portions generous and the price is low.</li><li>A fair warning the portions are huge.</li><li>The lamb flavour was so strong you could tell it had no marinade of any sort ( but maybe that 's what they 're going for -- also the skewer portions were incredibly small, my sister could n't help but laugh to herself when it came to the table).</li><li>There was a line up out the door for the restaurant come lunch time and everyone seated seemed to have huge portions.</li><li>Great portions and prices.</li><li>The portions are great, the Roti was tender, and the gravy was super flavorful, but I just found a lack of spice.</li><li>If you ever order take-out from this place, the portions are slightly larger for the same price, which is definitely a plus.</li><li>Overall, considering the HUGE portions for their dishes, it is certainly worth the value!</li><li>It is clean and I would definitely go back again. good place for dinner style foods and for fried rice and noodles. good portions.</li><li>Price, portions, speed, taste, hours, selection.</li><li>Lived up to their reputation for delicious food, with large portions and served quickly.</li><li>Everything was delicious with big portions, the only down side was the spicy squid which was chewy and hard to get through.</li><li>The portions were large.</li><li>Want large portions ?</li><li>: P The portions are pretty big.</li><li>I come here with family a lot, solely because they are good at accommodating groups ( without a reservation) with a decent wait time, and have generous portions for low prices!</li><li>The portions are gigantic, but we order family style and over-order so that we can have delicious leftovers the next morning.</li><li>The food is good though the portions are smaller than some other congee places, and the place is bright and clean.</li><li>Large portions, good price, and fast and efficient service.</li><li>Prices are very reasonable with generous portions.</li><li>Quick service, large portions, tasty dishes ( MSG) and cheap prices!</li><li>Their other items were also very good and huge portions.</li><li>Huge portions and quick service.</li><li>It 's quick and fast- and large enough portions that two and dine for under $ 10 with leftovers to take home for lunch tomorrow.</li><li>It was fast service excellent food quality and cost was not high but affordable, good portions to share with family or friends.</li><li>The food was okay, but the portions are small, considering the price.</li><li>In many instances the taste was OK ( nothing memorably good) but the portions are pretty small.</li><li>However, the service is pretty awful here, the food is mediocre ( portions are quite small) and the price is INFLATED and definitely not worth the asking price for most drinks.</li><li>With side dishes and rice rounding out the meal, we were very satisfied; the portions were generous but not overly so.</li><li>We shared three portions of DakGalBee with noodles, chicken, cheese and kimchi between 4 people.</li><li>From my experience, the portions are not properly measured.</li><li>If you order 2 portions, they cook in one frying pan.</li><li>If you order 3 portions, they use the same size frying pan.</li><li>Decent food ( especially since there are no other dak galbi places in Toronto) but service is TERRIBLE and portions are tiny !!!</li><li>Miraculously, a pan of dak galbi with 2 portions is exactly the same size as one with 3 portions ( with the same kind of meat and exact same add-ons).</li><li>Miraculously, a pan of dak galbi with 2 portions is exactly the same size as one with 3 portions ( with the same kind of meat and exact same add-ons).</li><li>Note that 2 portions is* barely* enough food for 2 adults.</li><li>Especially when their portions are miniscule!</li><li>It 's easy to make, it tastes way better, the portions are appropriate, it 's cheaper, and I can put whatever in it I want.</li><li>Otherwise, I agree the portions were quite small, basically `` you get what you paid for'' kind of style.</li><li>I especially love the Dak Gal Bee- you have to order a minimum of 2 portions it 's perfect for 2-3 people.</li><li>More unique Korean food- mainly bring the big sizzling plate- which tastes great especially with cheese and noodle add on, but is n't very good value for money, as it is minimum two portions.</li><li>The portions for everything were definitely smaller than average.</li><li>A downside to the Dakgalbee order is that you have to order at least 2 portions, so you ca n't really get an individual sized meal for this.</li><li>I just fear for the servers ' safety when they cook the noodles since the equipment they use to cook the dishes look a bit archaic. i used to go to the one in downtown and this time i thought i will give their yonge location a try !! ordered the chicken dakgalbee with their original joons sauce. and always its a must to add on cheese, ramen and ricecake !!! ( MY FAVVVV !!!) it was a little different as the dakgalbee was now cooked by a staff and brought to you instead of it being cooked right in front of you !! ( there was a little area on one side of the restaurant where a staff is cooking all the dakgalbee orders). i didnt like that as i enjoyed taking part in the cooking process and watching it cooked right in front of me !! the portions did seem smaller and the ramen ended up being overcooked. everything else was ok. maybe its just me but i find the downtown location tasted better!</li><li>This place gets packed pretty quickly on a busy day so be prepared to wait. dak gal bi is $ 9.25 per portion but you need to order a minimum of 2 portions.</li><li>I had heard that the portions here were small, but I was hoping for the best.</li><li>The portions were not tiny, but they were definitely not generous portions.</li><li>The portions were not tiny, but they were definitely not generous portions.</li><li>There were only four side dishes ( kimchi, sweet potato mash, seaweed salad, pickled carrots and radish), and each came in tiny portions.</li><li>The taste of the food was at least 3 stars, it loses a star because of the small portions ( no one should leave a restaurant hungry), and because I literally had to wash all my clothes the next day to get rid of the heavy onion smell ( likely from all the cooking around you).</li><li>Hot Pot on Yonge is a great choice, with fast service and good portions.</li><li>The portions are HUGE.</li><li>Their portions are huge and prices and extremely affordable.</li><li>Quick service and pretty big generous portions for sushi.</li><li>I have been a frequent customer at Sushi Bong for a good 4 years now and my four favourite things about this place is that the sushi is made at lightning speed ( literally like a fast food place), it 's very inexpensive when compared to other sushi restaurants, the portions are huge and filling and it 's always consistently good ( the specials that is).</li><li>Sushi quality is good, though I do n't know WHY the portions need to be so huge.</li><li>I mean I 've never been sick from the food here but have never expected much except large portions.</li><li>All that said, I go there pretty regularly, and the portions and taste is always pretty good:).</li><li>Small, large portions for a cheap price, quality is meh.</li><li>The service is quick and the food is decent with good sized portions.</li><li>But the portions are quite large.</li><li>Deducting one star as sometimes I do n't want to have to eat it in the car before a movie at Empress Walk ... more than 3 seats would be nice! korean-run close to yonge-finch. they 're very quick, and the portions are huge and quite tasty- especially the dynamite roll. the fish is n't always that fresh and not seasoned properly, so i 'd avoid the sushi/sashimi and stick with the rolls. but very good value. my main criticism is the owner 's wife- sometimes she yells uncontrollably and it 's not clear who she 's yelling at- the customer or the sushi chefs or perhaps she needs psychological evaluation.</li><li>Grabbed some takeout for dinner the other night Pros Large portions Very cheap Quick pickup Cons Was n't the best sushi I 've tried.</li><li>Big portions.</li><li>The portions are huge and less than $ 20 will fill me and my husband up.</li><li>Your orders are made lightning fast, and the portions are huge compared to the cheap prices.</li><li>And the portions are great!</li><li>She said the prices and portions were good here, and boy was she right.</li><li>Sushi is delicious &amp; affordable priced for the large portions.</li><li>Decent sushi place for a cheap price:) the portions are pretty big for only 10 dollars, so you do n't have to worry about leaving with an empty stomach.</li><li>S. Honestly, it 's cheap, it 's quick, the portions are huge, and I 've been there so many times already in a week.</li><li>Ok ok ok so the telephone skills in terms of customer service could use some improvement, but the sushi is fresh, fast and is served in generous portions.</li><li>The portions ( fish) in the rolls are getting less generous.</li><li>The service is friendly, food is delicious with huge portions, and the price is great.</li><li>A hidden gem for quality sushi, good portions for a good price.</li><li>Used to be huge portions at a cheaper price.</li><li>Make sure you order the dynamite roll and Chirashi as their portions are gigantic and will actually get you full without emptying your wallets!</li><li>Overall: This is a very small restaurant, and while it does not match what you 'd get in Xi' an, the food still tastes pretty good and comes in decent portions.</li><li>Their food is very good and tasty and always good portions.</li><li>But the portions are on the large side without being mammoth and the price is pretty good.</li><li>The prices of each dish is reasonable with generous portions and there is consistent food quality across the chain.</li><li>The portions are relatively large and consistently good.</li><li>Food was good, portions were huge, prices were reasonable.</li><li>I 've also had Pickle Barrel poutine in the past ( takeout) and their portions are generous!</li><li>I just wished the portions were a tad bigger.</li><li>Not only did it lack flavour and substance the portions were small.</li><li>Bang for your buck and good portions.</li><li>The portions are big, and you could probably feed 3-4 people with one duck.</li><li>Food was OK but I was expecting a bit more from the portions.</li><li>All were tasty and good portions.</li><li>Food portions were far from generous.</li><li>The portions were very reasonable, not too large, and not too small.</li><li>The portions are great and if you 're concerned about how `` expensive'' it is just remember you get what you pay for!</li><li>Despite a few mishaps, the food and portions were good.</li><li>One of my favourite places to enjoy Korean hotpot .. fantastic food, reasonable prices and HUGE portions.</li><li>Not the best Korean food I 've had but the portions are large and the side dishes are plentiful.</li><li>Flavours were rich, just a tiny bit on the salty side, and the portions were fair for the price.</li><li>The portions are good size.</li><li>They have a lot of side dishes and portions are really generous.</li><li>Both very delicious and very good portions.</li><li>Their prices are decent and their portions are great as well.</li><li>The portions are huge!</li><li>Generous portions too!</li><li>Very friendly service &amp; extremely large portions.</li><li>Have been here many times, friendly service and big portions.</li><li>The portions are pretty huge- so if you 're going there with an empty stomach you can eat the crepe/waffle by yourself no problem! but the waffle is definitely more filling, so if you are just going to have a small dessert, go with a friend and share:).</li><li>The portions are huge, and the prsentation of the crepe was pretty nice with zig zagged chocolate drizzle on top.</li><li>The portions are not small, but not huge either.</li><li>They have large portions and the crepes always comes with a side ( salad, ice cream ( !!!) etc) Their lattes are also very delicious with cute latte art on them.</li><li>The portions are more than enough for two, however since my counterpart was full I ended up pigging out and finishing the dish lol.</li><li>They have creative decorative lates and fair portions of waffles.</li><li>The portions were perfect to share as there were two scoops of ice cream!</li><li>Pastel 's interior was very cute and the food came in large portions but so big that I was unable to finish half of it.</li><li>Had the jerk chicken, portions were great.</li><li>The pho itself is flavorful and they give you generous portions with lots of veggies.</li><li>Their portions are reasonably sized and price for lunch.</li><li>There is a $ 1 charge for each piece of unfinished food, and items like the Edamame beans come in ridiculously large portions.</li><li>Good portions an surprisingly fresh.</li><li>But because of the lack of honesty with the bill, lazy service and small portions, I have no option other than suggest you stay away from this place.</li><li>Once again small portions and did n't taste that fresh Normally I would give 3 stars for a place like this but when compared to other sushi restaurants which I have given 3 stars this one is determinately a step below.</li><li>Fresh sushi/sashimi, generous portions, food is always hot.</li><li>The amount of rice in the Bento box is less than a fistful- the portions were very small.</li><li>Service was alright, atmosphere was OK, but what will keep me from coming back here is the sub-par food, the lack of decent portions and the whack prices.</li><li>The portions and decent and taste is okay.</li><li>Food is fresh and portions are a good value for price.</li><li>For the price not bad but if your a big eater then the portions are n't that big.</li><li>For what we paid, we were very pleasantly surprised with the generous portions and taste !!!</li><li>Very large portions, friendly staff.</li><li>Tempura good size portions.</li><li>The service is always fast and the food is consistently cooked well and served at very large portions.</li><li>The portions are massive and the sides I got were scrumptious as well!</li><li>The portions were enormous.</li><li>Terrific size portions.</li><li>The prices are a little bit higher than I 'm used to paying, but I found the food to be tasty, creative and with just the right portions.</li><li>The portions were plentiful and for the most part, everything was good.</li><li>The menu carries all the staples of a typical sushi restaurant, the quality is passable and the portions are good.</li><li>Prices are cheap and the portions are generous.</li><li>Overall prices and portions were reasonable.</li><li>Take out is also great from here and well packed with good portions!</li><li>Delicious tofu soup + yummy side dishes + generous portions = me, happy as a clam.</li><li>Everybody likes it, but the small portions kinda repel me from getting back there.</li><li>I find this place is better for lunch as the portions are not that big.</li><li>Great portions, and the soup tastes awesome.</li><li>The portions were extremely small.</li><li>The portions are pretty generous with seemingly endless tofu.</li><li>We would order 3-4 portions and then still get the same amount as 1 portion.</li><li>One of the three times they gave us large, reasonable portions like they used to consistently do, but two of the three times they flaked and gave us the smallest maki roll pieces I 've ever had.</li><li>The portions were generous and we were all very full and satisfied ( we ordered the set dinner menu for parties).</li><li>Good selection of hot plates, cafeteria style Italian eatery, nice sized portions, on the expensive side, tastes pretty good esp the meatball sub.</li><li>The portion size was more in line with what true real portions should be.</li><li>The portions are also above average.</li><li>The portions are fulfilling ( not too big, not too small), though a little on the salty side.</li><li>Good portions, check.</li><li>The portions are pretty small.</li><li>Generous portions.</li><li>Their portions are great and the traditional Korean side dishes are really yummy, which they refill when I quickly finish some lol Of course i order my `` GamJaTang'', table cooking style and it was a good portion and yummy!</li><li>The staff are friendly and the prices are pretty good for the portions they give you.</li><li>As the previous review, their portions are very hearty and for such a steal ( like every other pho stores) but usually it 's either quality or quantity but this place seems to hit both!</li><li>The portions are truly generous, there is a lot of meat, and the broth is very flavorful.</li><li>The portions are large, and the taste is good.</li><li>Good food, good portions It is cash only, be prepared, cause it doesnt say it anywhere.</li><li>If you are looking for an authentic Vietnamese restaurant with great taste, good prices and good portions, look no further.</li><li>They did this with all employees, so customers beware! portions here are really generous. the workers and waitresses are also really nice. for the people who are complaining about how the workers are ( ie rolliing the dirty dishes around etc) ... thats typically a normal vietnamese resturant for you. if u think this is dirty then u should not go to vietnam lol. but anywho, food here is really good. my parents go here every other day or so cos its close to their work and i also know a friend who eats here everyday too just cause he loves it. the pho, rice, and bun mam is really yummy. also my aunt is obssessed with their viet coffee as she says its authentic since there is so much flavour! also really cheap too:) oh yeah its cash only ... i think by now its safe to say if u go anywhere asian, just have cash with u cos chances are they are not going to take debit or credit!</li><li>Cheap and portions are huge and you get soooo much meat.</li><li>Not only did the food take an exceptionally long time to arrive, ( there were only about 6 other people who ordered after us) but the portions were off.</li><li>I mentioned it to the waitress who said different locations do different portions.</li><li>We had to cancel the Smoke Fish as we felt their portions were off which they oblige.</li><li>Family favourites:- Soup Filled Dumplings ( $ 5.99): ah XLB ... while I would n't say it 's the best that you can get in the city, it is way above average- Steamed Chicken Dumplings ( $ 5.99): juicy and plump- Rolled Onion Pancake with Sliced Beef ( $ 5.99): portions have been shrinking over the years, but it 's a great way to have your sliced beef and green onion pancake all at once- Deep Fried Tofu with Garlic Sauce ( $ 3.99): actually ordered this by accident once, but what a great mistake.</li><li>The price has been going up on this dish and portions have been shrinking ... but it still tastes good after all these years.</li><li>Is it just me, or are the portions shrinking ?</li><li>Service is quite good Food: come in large portions with a very reasonable price They give you free red bean soup as dessert.</li><li>Large portions and cheap ?</li><li>The portions are large but it had no taste, Not enough sauce to make it edible.</li><li>The Entrees: Their entrees are great and the portions are huge.</li><li>The portions were huge too !!</li><li>Did I mention that portions were bigger than meets the eye ?</li><li>A quick survey of my friends whom were with me and they too enjoyed their meals and thought the portions were more than they expected.</li><li>The portions here are massive but the prices are great.</li><li>Nice and comfortable booth seating- they have the 1960 's look with all the nostalgic photos and props. food is always good. portions are quite decent, almost large too.</li><li>Pretty decent, if definitely come back for the large portions and the food in a pinch!</li><li>This location just as good as the others but they make the best steak sandwich in the city by far give it a try much bigger portions then some of the other locations as well except Clairmont gives the biggest portions.</li><li>Overall, its a good place to go if you are under a budget! so sad! this place is close! i used to come here but recently i realize that it 's been replace by a korean restaurant. the wontons are so filled with shrimp, the fish balls had bones in them i always get scared the bones might choke me but the food tasted awesome! hot water dispenser is at each table so you make your own tea. the soups tasted too much of msg ... delicious but ... msg is bad for you. bye bye wonton place, i kinda miss you. small portions, but i love how u can put your own oyster sauce into your noodles, instead of asking like other regular wonton noodle places. also enjoyed having a hot water faucet at my table. clean and good atmosphere.</li><li>Large portions, small bill, that fits me just fine.</li><li>I never worry about leaving hungry because the portions are decently sized.</li><li>The staff is very friendly and the food is very yummy and big portions.</li><li>The portions are also big so prepare to have takeout if you do not eat a lot.</li><li>The portions are pretty big and I usually need to take the rest to go.</li><li>Food is delicious, portions are HUGE, healthy, and keep you satisfied for quite a bit!</li><li>The portions are very generous for the price that you pay.</li><li>This used to be at least a 4 1/2 star for me, every time I was in the area I 'd convince family/friends to meet me here! introduced quite a few Korean food newbies lol Their service was great and GamJaTang was really really yummy and good portions.</li><li>I recommend the pork bone soup, they give generous portions and it has spice options.</li><li>It was great ... and the portions were big.</li><li>Both dinners came with generous portions of veggies and salads that have an `` in house'' dressing that is so good they should sell it for take home!</li><li>Again tiny portions!</li><li>In terms of price I have to admit that they are one of the best in the GTA and the portions are massive as they really do not cheap out on the quantity of food they provide.</li><li>The food ( both appetizers and main courses) was super tasty came in large portions.</li><li>Really big portions.</li><li>Large portions.</li><li>While the food was delicious- fresh, great, large portions ( as they should be for the price ...), clearly prepared with knowledge and ability- I am still unlikely to return because of how I felt after due to my incorrect expectations of meal size/price.</li><li>The portions are also satisfying.</li><li>If I were to rate this restaurant on quality of food alone it would be a 3/5 overall, but the consistency of the food, large portions, big menu, and excellent service keeps me coming back for more and bumps it to a 4/5.</li><li>Good portions and well priced.</li><li>Great taste and generous portions.</li><li>Which came up close to the price for AYCE, way smaller portions.</li><li>The service is great, the portions are filling, and the products get delivered fast to the table.</li><li>Overall price of each bowl is $ 9 + tax and the portions are reasonable compared to some joints that I 've been to.</li><li>It is delicious and they are very generous with their portions.</li><li>Good value for giant portions!</li><li>The portions were big for one person as I think it 's designed for sharing.</li><li>Generous portions of meat &amp; vegetables cooked at your table with a little bit of entertainment.</li><li>The portions are small ( expected) but I did n't leave hungry.</li><li>Pros: Toasted bun, good grill flavor, generous portions of basic selection of toppings, large portion.</li><li>You will not have this problem here as they give you good portions on whatever you want.</li><li>Their portions are very large, so one meal will last for two easily.</li><li>Looked good with generous portions.</li><li>Summary: we would n't go back but the restaurant was busy and seems to get good reviews ( not really sure why). tldr; A bountiful breakfast menu with large portions and reasonable prices.</li><li>First off, the portions here are enormous so come with an empty stomach.</li><li>The portions were very small, and the food took so long to come out.</li><li>The price is cheap considering it 's on Yonge Street. great food and big portions.</li><li>The portions are a good size, and the service is very good.</li><li>The portions were ok- regular for a BBQ place with ribs and meats.</li><li>Second of all, for the portions you get, it 's a little pricey.</li><li>The pork bone soup is more expensive than other places ( $ 9.99 before tax)- the soup base was good, but the portions were not as impressive as other reviews claim.</li><li>Their portions are pretty generous for the price.</li><li>Large portions of meat and comes with bowl of white rice.</li><li>Food portions were quite large but quality of food on the low scale.</li><li>The portions were large, really filling and we didnt even finish half of our boxes.</li><li>They dont bring you all meal at once, they confuses you with small portions every 10-15 minutes, definitely i wont step in there in a long time ...</li><li>The portions are larger than I expected, I could barely even dig into my main of my bento ' complete meal'.</li><li>The food is fantastic, the portions are ridiculous and the prices are out of this world.</li><li>The food was spectacular and portions were very generous.</li><li>I think this place is good value for the price, and the portions of the food are filling!</li><li>The portions are also super small and

location also has the biggest portions.</li><li>Standard Chinese food for the mass, great portions and good prices.</li><li>The portions are huge so I definitely encourage sharing so you can open up your palette .. it 's the Chinese way.</li><li>Busy Busy!: This place is busy during prime time because of it 's affordable menu and large portions.</li><li>Do n't make customers wait if your tables are ready and empty and your staff are doing nothing. my go to place with my family !!!! portions are huge, not only do we get super full, we always end up taking left overs home because we could n't finish it.</li><li>Also the portions are good so we had lots of leftovers.</li><li>Like many have stated, the portions are huge and prices good too.</li><li>The portions are huge.</li><li>Ridiculous

on!</li><li>: P Cheap and MASSIVE portions.</li><li>The portions are still large as well and the service still extremely fast.</li><li>The portions are excellent, and large enough to feed two to four people as well.</li><li>However, I do appreciate that their food is not too oily or salty!- other pros: LARGE portions, large variety of congee and noodles, friendly staff- con: can become very crowded: ( side dishes I 've tried and liked: tofu and garoupa, house special chicken, mushroom and beef, tofu and mixed veggie congees I 've tried and liked: mixed vegetable and sweetcorn, sweetcorn and beancurd. congees I 've tried and disliked: sliced fish congee tastes bland ....</li><li>Huge portions.</li><li>On the plus side, they have large portions, but I think they 've been cutting back on ingredients over the years ( e.g.</li><li>Also, this place stays true to its roots- Cantonese-styled dishes; generous portions and quick to make.</li><li>All in all, for cheap and quick food with good portions and decent flavours, this place is certainly worth a try if you 're in the neighbourhood.</li><li>Before you go and order every food item that calls to you on their menu, fair warning: the portions are huge.</li><li>These dishes are usually 13-17 dollars and the portions are laughable.</li><li>Service is always friendly and portions are huge ..</li><li>The omelette ' are excellent
