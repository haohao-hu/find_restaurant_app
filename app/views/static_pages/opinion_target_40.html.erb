soon as this happens 6 other people do the same, and there was effectively no food delivery or other service until they were done 10 minutes later.</li><li>It 's a simple takeout spot with a few tables and a tv showing some Filipino variety show.</li><li>The place is tiny with about 5 tables.</li><li>Just a bunch of chairs &amp; small tables with no washroom.</li><li>Take out if you can, as they have ghetto tables that come from Fairview from before the renovation.</li><li>The tables are fancy.</li><li>They have some big tables which can fit larger group of people like 10 which is good if you coming with bunch of people.</li><li>Came here last night for my cousin 's birthday with a group of ~ 30 people ( 3 long high tables).</li><li>Got the gourmet well baked as requested and the primavera was just as good as it looked with spinach and loaded with veggies. nice sit down area with several tables and people-watching stools ... free wifi bebe!</li><li>There are a few stools where can eat and a couple of small tables inside.</li><li>We decided to sit in the patio area, however it was clear that there was a lag in clearing the filthy ashtrays on the tables.</li><li>On the other side is one long wooden-wall bench and separate tables.</li><li>Although it 's a small restaurant with not too many tables, I still like its environment and ambiance, simple and comfortable.</li><li>Overall I found everything quite pleasant- service was fast, polite and friendly, the restaurant is not huge ( 12 tables ?) but clean, the food came at good temperature and quite tasty.</li><li>I had already been waiting at the restaurant for a good half hour before getting seated ( the waitress asked a table of 2 if they could take 1 of their 2 tables -- stacked together--why could n't you have done that when I first got to the restaurant ?) when I asked if the apps could come out.</li><li>Some tables are too small, and if you go as a twosome, you have to make sure to fight for a table bigger than a napkin.</li><li>Lastly, the tables are never clean and I have to use napkins and clean my table myself.</li><li>The staff was friendly and the young lady serving us was very kind and asked us throughout if we needed anything, even though the place was jam packed and she was attending multiple tables.</li><li>There were actually a lot of empty seats but my guess is they did not have enough people to clean and get the tables ready.</li><li>A place for a brunch! 3 tables around us had issues with their food and so did we.</li><li>I very impressed by the Northern Restaurant, food in a enclosed area, lights, tables and chairs ... even a door!</li><li>The place is not exactly the cleanest and tables are covered with plastic just cause chili oil could create a mess.</li><li>Perfect for students hanging out or studying at the cafe with large group tables and smaller singular ones.</li><li>I saw a tree, leaf, happy face etc. in a nice big cup. as you can see in my picture I took, not only did it not come with a little image in it, it came in a small to go type of cup. taste wise, like a vending machine but I actually did n't mind, I liked it. to the cake, do n't let my picture fool you. the size of the cake was the size of my middle and index fingers put together. taste wise, straight out of a grocery store type of cake. and not the higher end grocery stores, more like price chopper style. but again, I actually did n't mind. what I did mind was the price tag that was attached to it. it was $ 12.99 for the drink and cake combo. to recap, to go type of cup drink with vending machine taste like quality and 2 fingers size low end grocery store quality piece of cake with high end cafe prices. and I forgot to mention the table we had. we were sandwiched between 2 other tables against a half wall and had a fake plant over hang us with its fake branch half way on to our table. too bad I 'm bad a describing the actual setting we were in, should 've taken a picture ( it is worth a thousand words). so based on the above description, this place should get no more than 2 stars. but you know what, the waitress had a nice smile and was friendly. this made all the difference in the world. will I come back ... probably not. maybe it was just tonight or my luck with the food/beverage. but hard to come back here when there are so many other options in area.</li><li>HUGE pieces of LEAN chicken, clean Thai basil and Vietnamese greens, ( including bean sprouts), and the tables and condiments are always clean.</li><li>As another reviewer mentioned, tables were separated well for private dining.</li><li>However it is not recommended for large groups of people, b/c seats are not moveable and tables are set for only about 6 people.</li><li>I do n't expect much for $ 8 so I am not complaining- the chicken yakitori served steaming hot! fogging up my camera .. the sauce is a little sweet, but the chicken was nice and moist Kiyomizu seems to be really popular with the office workers in the area during lunch time, every tables were occupied by the time I left.</li><li>The new chairs &amp; tables are far more spacious than the old cramped fast food attached chair &amp; tables which preceded them.</li><li>The new chairs &amp; tables are far more spacious than the old cramped fast food attached chair &amp; tables which preceded them.</li><li>It was quite empty and quiet there were 2 other tables besides our table, but 30 minutes later more tables were filled so it wasnt that bad.</li><li>It was quite empty and quiet there were 2 other tables besides our table, but 30 minutes later more tables were filled so it wasnt that bad.</li><li>We were greeted with a smile and led to a large booth even though it was only me and hubby: I would suggest getting one of the comfy booths around the perimeter because the tables in the middle are squished together so not much leg or elbow room.</li><li>Got to sit in a semi-private room ( 2 tables in the room) with a call button ( Korean restaurants sometimes have a buzzer/button that you press to notify the server that you want them to come over).</li><li>My parents had taken some friends out there for dinner and was appalled by the service and the layout of the tables.</li><li>There were a few empty tables on a Saturday Night- but compared to the dozens of crappy Italian and French restaurants in town, this place should be packed and lined up down the street!</li><li>That 's fine but all the tables are dirty.</li><li>The tables are super small and we asked to sit in a bigger table but were quickly told that we could n't.</li><li>Bad tasting food We ordered the two burger combo which ended up to be $ 26 ( 2 burgers, onion rings, a soft drink and a green tea soft drink) Wen I tried to look for a spot to sit down, I realized that the tables are dirty.</li><li>Overall, the restaurant was clean but a little cramped ( eaves dropping is very easy [ [ well because the tables are close together and the customers do tend to be LOUD ] ]).</li><li>Service: quick and they always take my `` special'' order without any issue Ambience: the restaurant is always busy with many tables but the turnaround time is quick, you usually dont have to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated Food: we always order the shrimp fresh rolls and PHO, everytime it 's fresh but the soup broth is the reason why we come here ... its light, not oily ( like some of the other locations) and TASTY!</li><li>Arriving Friday evening at around 6:30pm, there were 1-2 tables occupied.</li><li>There is 6 side dishes ( it 's delicious) but no refills ( 75 cents per dish refill) They seat 2 people at the 6 person tables, which I think is a bit ridiculously, they should rearrange the seats around so they can maximize the amount of people that can be seated at this restaurant, so there is n't always people waiting.</li><li>They literally had 2 waitress doing stupid task like arranging the menu at the counter instead of cleaning up tables or seating customers.</li><li>Add in the tasteful modern décor, interesting wall art, and clean, spacey tables and booths ... ca n't be beat !!</li><li>The location is not as large as I would have expected with the name ' Sushi Legend', but there were still a good amount of tables.</li><li>The environment is your typical Chinese-run AYCE, tables are close to each other and relatively small dinning area.</li><li>I find food on the seats and tables are n't properly cleaned.</li><li>The dining area is simple an array of large and small tables.</li><li>The place is small and tables are tightly packed, but they serve great, fresh, made-to-order, no nonsense, authentic Filipino food ...</li><li>I say takeout but they do have some tiny little tables if you want to get real intimate while gulping down greasy slices of cheese and bread.</li><li>Tip her well!)- There are 2 pool tables in the basement.</li><li>The tables were regularly wiped down, so was the garbage bins.</li><li>Cozy atmosphere, kept clean, with wooden tables.</li><li>Alas, today is a Friday and the 14 ( ish) tables are clucking with happy people ( very few chicks though).</li><li>But I stress the food is GOOD! some people call this place totally ghetto in the decorations and atmosphere. its just your regular breakfast diner type setup with about 5 or 6 tables.</li><li>Atmosphere: casual, dim, good for groups because they can put tables together.</li><li>This location gets busy to the point that the line-ups will run outside and the tables are usually full.</li><li>By the time we left ( around 7-pm), the place was very busy but I still saw some empty tables.</li><li>They also have really neat booths where the tables are very private and there 's a button to call the servers.</li><li>Yup, I 've counted at least 5 empty party for 2 tables.</li><li>However, this was on a Monday afternoon lunch and there were only 3 other tables being served.</li><li>Lots of empty tables.</li><li>I like the way tables are separated by beams and dividers, it gives each party a sense of privacy.</li><li>High ceilings, exquisite works of art, beautiful entrance door, comfy booths &amp; tables.</li><li>There are 3 tables in the store for people who just want a fast lunch.</li><li>There are only 2 tables at the back so it is mostly for take-out.</li><li>While sitting we found ourselves in conversation with 3 different tables.</li><li>The tables were all greasy.</li><li>However, the tables were sticky and clearly not attended to with much effort.</li><li>Not many people on a Monday ( 3 other tables) so we had great service and always came to refill our water.</li><li>Tonight, half the tables were empty but had n't been bussed and were still dirty.</li><li>I 've often walked by and seen messy tables but rarely people and now I know why.</li><li>We also noticed all the tables were set overnight so everything was a little dusty on the table.</li><li>The place is pretty packed for a snow-storm, was wondering why even though it is so busy that they only have one person serving so many tables.</li><li>It was not too busy and waiters can cover all the tables.</li><li>We came in with a party of 20 around 4 PM without prior reservation and still managed to grab 3 large tables.</li><li>Apathetic service and tables that smell like rancid dish rags are the least of congee queen 's worries ( York Mills).</li><li>Very busy place during peak hours so come early ( especially if you have a group of 6-10 since there are only a few large tables).</li><li>If it 's busy, it gets very loud and the tables are so cramped and close together that you inevitably end up hearing about the next table 's love life or medical updates.</li><li>The tables are small and not ideal for studying and there are no games! ( I sound like a seven-year-old, do ` I ?)</li><li>Came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch with some friends, the place was empty around noon but once it hits 1pm, the place is packed, all tables were occupied.</li><li>As we were leaving the food that was sprawled about different tables looked tasty, will have to give it a shot sometime.</li><li>The hostess/waitress knows there are 2 free tables usually for 4 ppl each.</li><li>Why could n't the waiter just serve both our tables the appetizers ?!</li><li>There were 2-3 girls working in the front and approximately 3-5 more tables of 2-4 people during our time there and food still took FOREVER to get to us.</li><li>We had dinner here on a Tuesday evening and the restaurant was not busy- 4 other tables occupied.</li><li>There are large tables to accommodate bigger groups and they take reservations.</li><li>If you want good sushi at a low price, here is the place for you. cheap and huge rolls. better to take out bc they dont have many tables and the place is always busy with people coming and going for take out.</li><li>Small dining area of three or four tables, but this place is mainly a take-out place with lots of traffic in and out of the small shop from walk-in customers.</li><li>This restaurant is very small with only 2-3 tables which can sit approx.</li><li>Tight space with 3 mini tables.</li><li>The restaurant itself is small, with only 3 tables located inside for seating.</li><li>There are only 3 tables for dine-in ... good luck.</li><li>Nice `` little'' take out place with only 2 tables but that is all that is little here.</li><li>They also have small tables, maybe 4 of them, for sit-in customers.</li><li>Well there are two or three tables, but they are always full and you will never get to sit down, so plan on taking it to go!</li><li>Only 2 or 3 tables to dine in and even then its a tight fit.</li><li>The dining area only has three tables, so take-out is usually your best bet here.</li><li>The sitting area is tiny with I think 2 tables and the rest bar like area.</li><li>It is a tiny, tiny place with three tables however, one table is reserved to put takeout orders on so do n't try and sit there because you will promptly be told to move.</li><li>This is pretty much a takeout restaurant with only 2 small ( and unsightly) tables.</li><li>It 's mostly for take out as there is only 2 tables available howver have sat in on mutiple occasions.</li><li>I come here all the time with my wife to eat in but mostly take out since there are only 3 tables.</li><li>One word of suggestion however, there is very limited seating ( the place is the equivalent to the size of a study room) and there is only three or four tables to sit at so it is best to order take-out and eat elsewhere.</li><li>Although the tables are really tightly packed, do n't worry about people peering at you while you eat ... everyone is either busy shoveling the food into their mouths ( like me) or are on their phones.</li><li>It is filled with Chinese, and the tables are too close to each other.</li><li>It 's a small place with just a row of in-wall table for single or couple diners and short tables against the other wall with in-wall benches and chairs on the other side.</li><li>The tables and bar seating are all cramped together.</li><li>Note, the place is really small, only 5 tables or so.</li><li>There are only 3 small tables in the store.</li><li>The the tables are cleaned and always have utensil bundles ( do they have an actual name for those ?).</li><li>Be warned that they 're usually busy, and there 's not a huge amount of tables.</li><li>Inside, there is n't much to say aesthetics-wise about the functional small tables and handful of small booths either.</li><li>5 minutes later the duo in front of us get their tables and are seated.</li><li>There were empty tables.</li><li>Every time I 've been, it has been only the two ajummas who are on duty to wait the tables and work the cash register.</li><li>The place is very small inside, 4 booths and only 5-6 tables and barely any room for you to stand while you wait.</li><li>But there are not that many tables and if you come here on the weekend during busy time, you 'll have to wait.</li><li>Also, There tables are very very closed to each other.</li><li>Service- When we arrived, no one came to greet us instead 4 servers were just hanging out behind the counter and yelled out sit wherever and when we choose our spot they said `` not there'' ( because we needed to be at least 3 persons) and then my friend pointed out a group of 2 who were sitting at a 3-4 person table and her excuse was to blubber no and forced us to sit in between two busy ( and might I add super tight) tables.</li><li>Not very spacious either as you have 3/4s of the tables lined up against one side and 2 tables lined up against the counter where they serve and make drinks/food.</li><li>The only bad thing is that there is not a lot of tables- everyone wants to stay long as it is a good place for dates or just to catch up with friends.</li><li>The shop itself is on the smaller side, but they do offer ~ 7-9 tables indoors if I 'm not mistaken.</li><li>Tables are meant for two or for side tables- groups of four-five max ... good place for a small gathering of friends or dessert dates but not a contender for big groups.</li><li>Small shop, few tables inside and outside.</li><li>They are quite pricey however, and have only limited tables.</li><li>When I went in I noticed that there are minimal seating, 6 tables i believe.</li><li>There was nobody at the door and more than half the tables were empty- you can wait until I 'm done pouring.</li><li>Everything else is ok, they do n't skimp on the portion and tables are still being turned efficiently.</li><li>But it 's nice that the tables are equipped with bottles of different flavoured sauces.</li><li>The restaurant itself is clean with a good variety of tables, booths and individual seats.</li><li>Service was friendly and quick, considering we were one of 2 tables.</li><li>Why did we have to wait to be seated when then were many empty seats and tables ???</li><li>All your tables are for 4.</li><li>The tables are only for 4 people although a couple of tables can be attached to each other.</li><li>Not an ideal place for a large group of people, i think I only saw 2 round tables that fit up to around 6 people.</li><li>It 's small with small tables and whatever you order will fill the entire table.</li><li>The restaurant interior is n't anything amazing, but seats are comfy, tables are appropriately sized, and there are bigger group tables available should you be bringing a group of 5 or more.</li><li>They stood around twiddling their thumbs while customers were waiting for set-ups and did not even notice when tables were not set up.</li><li>Friendly staff, just wished the dining tables were n't placed so close to each other.</li><li>Because of the way the tables are designed there are ( ideally) two chefs standing back-to-back, each facing their teppanyaki grills, surrounding by a C-shaped arrangement of chairs.</li><li>The decor is old, the fabric on their seats shows its age in wear and tear and the tables are always a bit sticky."</li><li>There 's an all you can eat menu if that 's your thing but the best part of the experience at MoJ are the tepenaki tables.</li><li>I noticed a reserved sign on maybe 8 of the tables ...</li><li>AND underneath that sign on a couple of the tables are fresh copies of the newspaper ????</li><li>The servers clearing the tables were mostly cheery and efficient, but I feel overall that the service used to be better.</li><li>The restaurant has about 5 small tables outside but the patio area faces the parking lot.</li><li>Unable to accomodate customers with the simplest request of putting 2 tables together, just 2 tables not the walls ...</li><li>Unable to accomodate customers with the simplest request of putting 2 tables together, just 2 tables not the walls ...</li><li>The décor is a hundred shades of brown with bright but also amber lighting, there are square and round tables.</li><li>They were very accommodating, and when i got there, they had 2 of the 3 tables ready.</li><li>It is always packed, so be prepared to wait a little, and the tables are so close together that you feel like you are in one big cafeteria.</li><li>There are 3 tables in the restaurant if you really want to eat there.</li><li>Lighting is a bit dim &amp; tables in the back are a bit more private so you can enjoy a good date here as well ...</li><li>The place looks poorly maintained, the tables who have finished eating and were long gone were cluttered with dishes and trash on the tables, even once the place was n't busy at all!</li><li>Including us there were 4 tables at the time.</li><li>This is a perfect environment for 4 people group because their tables are big.</li><li>It took awhile to be seated when there were empty but uncleaned tables), they did n't come by when I rang the bell several times, but I think it was because they did n't have enough staff.</li><li>They sort of have some waitresses that are responsible for your tables.</li><li>The service was perfect; two very professional and friendly servers were assigned to our four tables.</li><li>Some tables are round for larger parties, and square for fewer guests.</li><li>The restaurant had decent number of tables filled for a monday night.</li><li>They have some chairs and tables outside on the walkway, but since it 's not an enclosed space, you can not have alcohol at those tables.</li><li>It 's not really a good place to eat in, since the tables are minuscule and if a crowd comes in to order, you 're stuck with their hip in your face as they line up- or you 're next to where the girls pack up the orders or by the bathroom.</li><li>There are a couple of small tables, however I do n't see many people staying in to eat here.</li><li>The new manager is some young guy who 's ego is way bigger than it should be. and the server had a bad attitude and did n't do a good at replenishing drinks or cleaning tables.</li><li>Cons: On a not-so-busy Sunday afternoon, we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, although many empty tables were available.</li><li>A lot of the tables were n't cleared off.</li><li>- Dirty restaurant: none of the tables were clean when we came in.</li><li>BBQ places ALWAYS have the bottles on the tables.</li><li>This restaurant is a sister restaurant of Pearl Harbourfront Chinese Cuisine There are 3 rows of tables- the rectangular tables on one side with sofa, the large table for family in the middle and the small tables on the other side.</li><li>The tables are small, and it 's a bit crowded.</li><li>I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in and saw a little cozy Japanese restaurant with booths and small tables as if taken from Japan.</li><li>The tables were close together, with not much elbow room.</li><li>She did n't take as much time to chat with us or approach us in comparison to the other tables which had a bunch of guys.</li><li>The food: When we entered the main hall, I was astonished by the sight of food decorating the tables.</li><li>The environment is comfortable, spacious, tables not too close to one another, and overall size of the restaurant itself is pretty big.</li><li>Also, a lot of the servers were sending food to the wrong tables, there seemed to be a general confusion with most of them.</li><li>What was n't so pleasant was the 2nd server that came up to us and `` you 're not supposed to have two tables''.</li><li>Yes, the guys at the grill station are fantastic--very efficient while never undercooking the meat--and the servers are on their game with clearing the tables.</li><li>There were 4 tables in there that night, and 6 waitresses and a few busboys etc.</li><li>Walking in at 1:00pm on a Sunday, the tables were rather empty, but soon fill up.</li><li>Lots if nicks and scratches on walls and tables.</li><li>In addition to the noodle buffet, they have some chinese favorites ( dim sum weekend mornings) on the side tables.</li><li>They have round tables and booths.</li><li>We were pretty much salivating at what we saw at the larger tables, so our expectations rose with every passing minute!</li><li>My favorite six grains and assorted fungus congee does not have as many of six grains as there are at Congee Queen, and I 'd rather pay few cents more for my extra grains:)) The decor is also a lot simpler and more generic and the seating arrangement is not the greatest with booths lining the sides and round tables put just in front of the entrance, so new customers literally stand over the eating patrons.</li><li>I say that because the service was VERY slow and there were only 2 other tables in the entire place.</li><li>Find something else. went there with a friend for lunch, it was buffet. the place was quite small but with a lot of places to sit! they have large tables too! the service was great, fast and friendly people. the buffet include: one soup 2 or 3 salad options many dips and sauces 1 rice 3-4 kind of vegetable dishes 5-6 meat dishes ( include chicken, lamb, beef, shrimps) they also have bread ( nan) and appetizers ( could not remember the names) they also have desserts ( 2 kinds) and fruits the taste was very good and not too spicy, however they have really extreme spicy sauces! the price was around 10 dollars as a neighborhood restaurant it one of the best options in the area and for sure I 'll be back:).</li><li>Most of the time when i walk by you can see 1 or 2 tables at most with people.</li><li>There 's a couple ' private' booths but most of the tables are n't setup like that.</li><li>They seemed to be short staffed ( there was one waitress serving 5 different tables) and the atmosphere was n't as comfortable as I would 've liked but I enjoyed the food nonetheless.</li><li>Half the restaurant are booths, half open tables.</li><li>The staff was unenthused and the tables are wobbly and dirty.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
