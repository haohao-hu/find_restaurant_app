<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 125' %><h2>batter<br />occurrence: 46</h2><div><ol><li>I like the fried zucchini the most, the kimchi has a spicy-sweetness with a bit of sour, and the broccoli with the white salad dressing was the best. unfortunately the main was not as good anymore. the kalbijim was not tender at all, and there is n't any potato or radish with the stew. while sweet and sour pork tasted ok, but the sauce was a bit thick, and the batter too. the worst was the Kimchi fried rice, the potion was really small, almost no Kimchi in it, and it taste really sour, not in a good way. and the fried rice was n't hot, not spicy hot and not temperature hot, yet it just came out of the kitchen less than 5 minutes after we order it.</li><li>The batter on the fish was a bit on the greasy side, but was a nice consistency- not too crispy but not too soft.</li><li>The batter on the fish is a tad bit thicker than most other fish and chips joints, but I did n't mind.</li><li>That effort did not pay off, although they specialize in halibut ( my favorite) their batter leaves lots to be desired.</li><li>The batter was soggy and was more like a thick fish n ' chip type batter, the beef tasted like 2 day old roast beef and it was cut very thick.</li><li>The batter was soggy and was more like a thick fish n ' chip type batter, the beef tasted like 2 day old roast beef and it was cut very thick.</li><li>And thr batter was poorly placed.</li><li>It was chicken breast strips, coated in a light crispy batter.</li><li>Usually the batter is too thick and sometimes the broth is n't quiet as good, but this one really did it for me.</li><li>Food/Service: 3/5, the batter on the chicken fingers were n't the best but they had a wedding party and it should n't be but that was the excuse.</li><li>The tempura here is not really to my liking as the batter they use is not as crumbly as I prefer.</li><li>I would have liked the batter a tad lighter, but I can deal with this.</li><li>I ordered the halibut- batter is golden yellow light crispy goodness.</li><li>Their halibut is fresh, and the batter is tasty with just the right crunch and thickness.</li><li>Next time, I will take a picture of my fish halfway eaten to show how well the batter stays attached to the fish.</li><li>The batter is so, so excellent.</li><li>Portions are great, fish is juicy and batter is neither too thick or greasy.</li><li>The batter was very thick ... heavy handed battering.</li><li>Still, the food is so amazing and fresh, I still give this place FIVE STARS ALL DAY, SON!***** the place is very clean. the fish i had was very fresh and the batter was very crispy. we also ordered the chicken pie which was good but the pie was taken out of the fridge in front of us and taken to the cook to be heated up. nothing special about the pie, a bit expensive in my opinion. it cost more than the fish. chips, fish and whatever has to be ordered separately. we did get free slices of brown bread with butter on the side. i just wish that they give a bit more on the plate than just a fish. weird.</li><li>All tasted great with soft and flakey fish inside the light and non-greasy batter.</li><li>I stood out like a sore thumb walking in to have my dinner alone and as Asian in a sea of mature English diners Halibut with Chips ( $ 12.95)- the batter is really light and deep fried to perfect crispiness!</li><li>The batter was crispy and stuck onto the fish very well which is hard for some places to do.</li><li>The fish is always fresh and the batter is crispy and just right Even the tartar sauce is homemade.</li><li>Batter was right, fries were good and most important, the fish was big.</li><li>But their deep fried dishes are a bit lacking and not crunchy enough despite the batter they use ( sweet n sour pork, small fishes).</li><li>Equal balance of batter used, and not overcooked.</li><li>Some things i get every single time- green dragon roll ( fav), beef ribs ( greasy and fatty but SO good), tempura ( the batter is not too heavy and is just right), grilled squid, beef/pork enoki rolls ( these are amazing), grilled eggplant ( if you love eggplant you will love this), teppanyaki veggies ( it 's basically cooked in butter) A must try if you 're into AYCE First time here and I like it.</li><li>Super saucy without making the batter soggy. ( and note: I normally dislike chicken dishes, or chicken in general).</li><li>The batter is nice and crispy, and our server deboned the legs at the table and shredded the duck into bite size pieces suitable for the wrappers.</li><li>Complete lack of duck flavor and the crispy batter was way too thick.</li><li>I loved how the cooks cut the rings into sections to make the pieces more manageable, and the batter was light enough that you could still see the white flesh of the meat, but was extremely flavourful and crispy.</li><li>Ordered: Coconut Shrimps* 5 pieces of coconut shrimps for $ 9.75* Shrimps were butterflied and deep fried with actual coconut bits in the batter* When it arrived, it was just luke warm* And the sauce looked like it was from McDonalds ( seriously ?)* I was the one who wanted to try them and boy, did I regret ordering these* For $ 10, this was def not worth it Ordered: Lobster Bisque* Small personal lobster bisque for $ 8.95* This was n't very hot either but it was delicious!* It is super creamy and rich with lobster meats* My dad loved this and finished a entire cup himself* It is def not cheap but very much worth it Ordered: Jumbo Garlic Shrimps* 9 jumbo shrimps Butterflied and Baked $ 25.50* If lobster is not your thing, they always have shrimp dishes* They were perfectly cooked and had good flavor with garlic bits* It was kind of on the dry side but with the melted butter it was fine* I just tried one of this and my sister had the rest of it Ordered: 2lb Steamed Lobster &amp; 4lb Broiled Lobster* 2lb lobster was $ 57.00 and 4lb lobster is $ 97.00* You can choose the lobster to be steamed or broiled* I mostly had the broiled 4lb ( obviously shared it with others)* Steamed had much clean taste since no other seasoning was used* Broiled lobster tasted more rich with the crust on top* 4lb lobster was so huge the claw was as big as my face* They get pretty messy to eat so you are given a plastic bib to put around your neck Summary: I walked in not expecting much but I fully enjoyed the meal at The Lobster Trap.</li><li>Batter was too dark.</li><li>The chicken itself had extra batter and was n't drenched over it, which I suppose is what makes it `` more crispy'' than the other offerings.</li><li>Batter is mixed with corn starch so it 's a lighter and fluffier batter than the American style of fried chicken.</li><li>The batter was light and fluffy and did n't give me that gross feeling when I eat KFC.</li><li>But to have chicken come out crispy and juicy with just the right amount of batter is NOT trivial.</li><li>Korean fried chicken ca n't go wrong. their batter is not too thick and it 's very crispy.</li><li>However, The Fry has the best batter in terms of fried chicken of any culture.</li><li>Marche makes homemade crepes with sweet and buttery batter, which is stuffed with your choice of ice cream, fruit and garnish sauces such as chocolate, vanilla or the rare caramel that sometimes makes an appearance.</li><li>The taste is pretty good but it sad that the ice water sipped into the batter and it make the inside of the batter soggy.</li><li>But the batter was greasy and oily, even for shrimp tempura.</li><li>The chicken was moist and the batter was still crispy when served.</li><li>Hand rolls are great, and tempura is crispy and batter is fresh and not overdone and drenched.</li><li>The roasted chicken was also not good and the chicken bucket had batter that tasted like onion ring batter.</li><li>For the main I had the set course curry tiger shrimp dinner ( $ 10.50) which included miso soup, salad, steamed rice, a bowl of thick slightly spicy curry ( it was alright) and four pieces of breaded tiger shrimps which were okay- the breaded batter was too thick.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
