<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 395' %><h2>shawarmas<br />occurrence: 10</h2><div><ol><li>I 've had some good shawarmas and I 've had some bad ones ...... but what 's been consistent is that the tahini sauce has always in the past ended up bringing me pretty close to throwing up.</li><li>The shawarmas are reasonably priced and consistently good and you can always find a seat regardless of what time you walk in.</li><li>The line was long during lunch hour, and the counter where they cook and prepare the shawarmas is pretty much right near the entrance door, which makes it a bit of an inconvenience in terms of the line/getting in and out.</li><li>Shawarma Max is a cool little place on Yonge St and Hollywood Ave where they 're serving up shawarmas in a place that oddly resembles a Subway on the inside.</li><li>I found it to be actually hot compared to the mild crap most places put in their shawarmas.</li><li>So you have your normal sized shawarmas in a pita- the portion you end up with when you 're in a touristy area and shawarma is the most exotic choice around.</li><li>Then you have your very generous, ballooning shawarmas in a pita- the kind offered by most authentic, hole-in-the-wall Middle Eastern spots.</li><li>The shawarmas here are n't bad, but I would n't come here for that.</li><li>The menu consists of shawarmas ( Lamb, chicken, beef), falafel, kebabs ( beef or chicken) in a pita or as a platter with salad, hummus, garlic sauce and rice or fries for the meat options.</li><li>I had a couple of bites of his sandwich and I can vouch to this being one of the better shawarmas I 've had in Canada.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
