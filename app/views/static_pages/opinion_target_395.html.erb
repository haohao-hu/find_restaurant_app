( best fried calamari we 've ever had) Service was very good, always attentive and made sure we had tea/water and never felt disrespected/rushed.</li><li>But my favourite is still the fried calamari!</li><li>We tried the fried calamari to start, the mushroom risotto, and the cavateli bolognese which is a short pasta with tomato and minced meat ragu.</li><li>We started off with an assortment of appetizers- the carpaccio, bruschetta, fried calamari, the rustic della casa platter, and the caprese salad.</li><li>We started with Mieng Kum, Pla Meuk Tod ( Fried Calamari), and Tom Yum Goong soup, and our entrees were The Royal Pad Thai, Thai Islamic Noodles, and Seafood Fried Rice.</li><li>We started with the Fried calamari.</li><li>Between the four of us, we ordered the fried calamari, royal pad Thai, crispy beef red curry and the crispy duck wrap.</li><li>Apps we had included the mango salad ( standard), chicken and beef satay skewers were some of the worst I 've had anywhere, and the fried calamari had too much breading and was overly oily ( thought my kids loved it).</li><li>So it was more like `` salted fried calamari'' rather than salt &amp; pepper.</li><li>Their fried calamari is always fresh and crispy which makes a lot of people come back to the store.</li><li>We ordered a spicy seafood soup ( very spicy), fried calamari, sweet potato tempura, sushi &amp; sashimi dinner combo, and a green dragon roll which all together cost $ 48, so not bad.</li><li>The fried calamari are very dark, perhaps for not changing the oil recently.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
