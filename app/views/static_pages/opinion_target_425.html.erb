<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 425' %><h2>pepper<br />occurrence: 9</h2><div><ol><li>I did n't get the usual pepper and cheese until I had to ask.</li><li>The sauce was entirely too spicy and tasted like someone had been a little too generous with the pepper.</li><li>Spices like cumin, pepper, chili flakes, onion oil, all have their place here but the sugar was so pronounced I felt like I was eating candied rice pudding.</li><li>They provided lettuce, other greens, sauce, pepper and garlic for us to wrap our meat in.</li><li>I choose my own amount of garlic, pepper, no salt, sesame seed oil, spring onion, parsley.</li><li>We decided to order the supreme super bowl congee, cantonese chow mein, three kinds stuffed vegetables ( eggplant, tofu and green pepper), minced pork and dried fish green beans and fried chili turnip patties.</li><li>The waitress ended up charging her for the whole meal explaining that it was not their fault that she could not have pepper.</li><li>UPDATE: In a recent order, the biryani was made with LARGE chunks of bell pepper ( yes, bell pepper, orange bell pepper to be exact, which is really not what you 'd expect in a biryani) and massive pieces of onion too.</li><li>The meat is tender and moist ( apologies to those who hate this word) and it 's seasoned with red onions, coriander ( aka Cilantro), parsley ( aka Italian cilantro, just kidding) and from what I recall, paprika, pepper and cumin ... I am sure there were more.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
