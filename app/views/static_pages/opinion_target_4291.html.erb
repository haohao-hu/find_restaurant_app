<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 4291' %><h2>plastic cutlery<br />occurrence: 1</h2><div><ol><li>There is a mustard &amp; ketchup station with push buttons slightly to the left of the Wendy 's ordering counter, but salt, pepper and plastic cutlery are no longer longer available at this station; you have to ask counter staff for those items, which is NOT IMO an improvement, given this is a very busy restaurant all the time, always line ups, as we who live in Weston have few dining options;_; ( For God 's sake, food franchises &amp; restaurant chains, take pity on Weston- Lawrence &amp; open up some businesses here!)</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
