<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 42' %><h2>owner<br />occurrence: 171</h2><div><ol><li>The owner is so friendly and helpful.</li><li>2 stars for lack of parking and hassles I 've had with staff ( owner and son) on two occasions.</li><li>I have been at this place for past few days and simply its the worst experience. the first day I got my gyro order on toasted white bread with no sauce or any other form of toppings !! when I complained to server and ask if I coukd see the manager `` I was told that there is no manager at this place and the owner is running the place'' AND OF COURSE THE OWNER WAS NOT AROUND. on second visit I ordered the bruschetta dish, no basil or olive oil was used !!!!</li><li>I have been at this place for past few days and simply its the worst experience. the

manager at this place and the owner is running the place'' AND OF COURSE THE OWNER WAS NOT AROUND. on second visit I ordered the bruschetta dish, no basil or olive oil was used !!!!</li><li>Since the owner changed, this restaurant was just not the same.</li><li>The owner is very pleasant and friendly.</li><li>The owner sometimes will have fresh baked cake which tastes great with coffee.</li><li>The owner remains unchanged, staff are the same, d√©cor untouched.</li><li>There are suggestions of `` Asian-ness'' that maybe do n't resonate quite as the owner intended ... check out the enormous urns encased in a glass display downstairs by the bathroom.</li><li>It was ok i should say, but for sure not a place to come often.- the waiter do n't give attention at all, and do n't botter asking about the menu choices cause he wo n't give a nice answer;- green tea comes for free and it is good, but again the waiter wo n't come around to refill;- what i asked did n't look too attractive and either too tasty, but for $ 6 I guess I ca n't say much;- the owner is a nice person, not that talked much, but gave attention and asked if I liked.</li><li>- My waitress put my order in wrong ... instead of Tempura Combo, she put in Shrimp Tempura ( $ 8.95)- The owner was really nice.</li><li>The owner was around greeting all the tables and making sure every customers were happy!</li><li>Luckily none of those allergies are life threatening but I could not believe that an owner would be so irresponsible with something as serious as allergies !!</li><li>You can see the owner pushing a no frills cart back and forth each day!</li><li>I was just in for a quick lunch, and while eating with my girlfriend, a pair of police officers came in to speak with the owner.</li><li>Shame about the owner having a screaming match with police in the middle of lunch though.</li><li>Btw, the owner said she would soon be renovating the place and changing the name to `` Mennie 's Place'' ( spelling ?).</li><li>One thing I did notice is that they switched ownership and the new owner is a little sheepish, he seems like he 's sleepy all the time and does n't want to work.</li><li>The owner is very friendly.</li><li>I know they are the owner and they can reject me but there were no more than 3 tables at that time.</li><li>Regardless, the owner refused to honour it.</li><li>The owner did n't care.</li><li>Owner was very kind to serve me at 10:30 am before they opened.</li><li>Now this is my regular stop when I am in Toronto on business ( even if I have to go out of my way) Fast forward to today over 2 years later and the owner remembers me and even recalled amazing details of our first meeting.</li><li>Almonst all the high rises, this restaurant is in a little house along Yonge St. It 's a very cozy restaurant with one wait staff and the owner who takes your order.</li><li>The service was reasonably good, and the owner was present and attended the table often.</li><li>Mussel has nothing special, the special recommendation of carppacio and lamb shank from the owner are not up to my expectation for a normal dinner place.</li><li>A cute little family-run restaurant ( a renovated house) with a super friendly owner and delicious food.</li><li>Very good food, you cannot miss this if you simply want good food in nice environment. cozy little family house style, very friendly owner and server.</li><li>The business motto of the owner is great, they cook a large quantity of rice and meat in the morning.</li><li>Maybe it 's the fact that this place has always been loosely associated with the rumour that it 's owned by Sean Paul 's uncle, and that there 's a framed Photo of Sean Paul hanging out with the owner on the store wall.</li><li>The owner is Greek, and is proud of what the kitchen puts out.</li><li>Great service from the wait staff and the owner took time to come sit with us for a few minutes as we finished our meal.</li><li>The owner seemed nice, but unfortunately she does not speak English, and was not able to service the guests.</li><li>Realising that she would get no further with such an obtuse individual, my wife got the contact information for the owner and left.</li><li>But the food is absolutely wonderful. we are regular customer, s at this restaurant, Tonight we ordered the usual, our favourte dish is peanut chicken, we brought our three dish, s home and upon opening the chicken we saw half the dish was peanut sauce and less than half the usual amount of chicken, I called the restaurant and spoke to the owner for ten minutes, she insisted that it was made the same as always, It was not at all, we paid 11,95 for peanut sauce and a small amount of chicken,, The arrogant owner could not care less, refusing to credit us for next time we picked up, or d delivering a new dish to our home, This place the staff is unfriendly, not well mannered, and horrible customer service, and the food was awful, except for the fried rice, it was good, If your looking for bad service this is the place to go, the customer is never right,, be warned, When Szechuan was still something Torontonians lined up for, Henry 's Hunan Place was the place to beat.</li><li>First time, all dishes were great, fried pork chop, marinated raw crab, and tofu soup Restaurant: Jung Soo Nae Cuisine: Korean Location: North York Address: 5754 Yonge St Price Range: ~ $ 10 1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent Food: 3.5 Service: 3 Ambiance: 2 Overall: 3.5 Extra information:* 2 locations owned by 2 different owner* Lunch menu avail* Seasonal menu avail Jung Soo Nae is what you call a ' hole in the wall' restaurant.</li><li>We were quickly seated by who I think was one of the owner and I remember other yelpers mentioned that the owner and servers were quite rude.</li><li>I felt a bit of that rudeness when my bf asked the owner how good the crabs were because he 's never had them here in Toronto and the owner answered they 're the best in Toronto.</li><li>I felt a bit of that rudeness when my bf asked the owner how good the crabs were because he 's never had them here in Toronto and the owner answered they 're the best in Toronto.</li><li>Staff was friendly though Great lunch spot for this area with a super friendly owner.</li><li>She seems like she must be an owner because she 's at the register 90% of the time.</li><li>Though the waitress there was polite, the other lady ( presumable the owner due to her lack of uniform) however was quite rude.</li><li>We flagged down someone who is working there and given the attitude and his age and the way he was dressed, he seemed to be the owner.</li><li>The food is great but the owner has the worst attitude for someone in the service industry.</li><li>The delightful &amp; polite owner was kind enough to comp me an espresso.</li><li>Service: The wait service is excellent AND the owner if the restaurant comes and waits as well while greetings clients.</li><li>Would I return: Yes Bill w/tx &amp; tip for one: $ 40 Not just because the owner is friend of my dad but the food there is pretty good.</li><li>SERVICE: The owner is incredibly rude.</li><li>When my friend told him that the place was only half empty and that he 'd move it if someone needs the table, the owner threatened to kick us out.</li><li>The owner is a character ( in a good way).</li><li>The owner did not take action at all and was hesitant to apologize.</li><li>The owner was extremely reluctant to refund the bill and needed heavy persuasion from us.</li><li>The owner gives a soup nazi-esque first impression but he 's only pulling your jerk.</li><li>The owner is super friendly and chats everyone up, and the clientele does n't scare me into locking my car doors like some of the other ... how do I put this ... ethnic restaurants on/around Victoria Park Ave.</li><li>And I can only assume that he was the owner.</li><li>The owner is a funny and friendly man.</li><li>The owner is nice and friendly.</li><li>The owner seemed to recognize my girflriend and I after just a couple visits, which I always enjoy.</li><li>Yes the service is slow and inefficient and the owner has only one debit machine, and yes it can be SUPER annoying when you are in a hurry.</li><li>When, out of desperation, I asked for some Parmesan, I was told that they charge extra and that the owner did not recommend it any way, as it would dry out the pizza.</li><li>The owner was originally frank mcnies who had a very successful fish and chips shop in etobicoke.</li><li>I 'd definitely go back to this restaurant again to try out their other menu items. family owned italian restaurant. short summary: very yummy food, portions could be bigger, sometimes slow service but very friendly lady owner, always packed at lunch, which is frustrating since they dont accept reservations. longer summary: the decoration of the restaurant is very cozy and gives a feeling of a patio dining even though it 's all indoors. the service though slow is very friendly and we often end up chatting with the owner for few minutes while we 're waiting for the order. it usually gets very packed at lunch by the people from surrounding office buildings. and since they do n't accept reservations sometimes it means that you have to arrive right after the doors are open ( which is 1130am everyday I think) in general very welcoming place but a bit on a pricey side.</li><li>My visit lasted 30 seconds, which was long enough to nod to a couple of otherwise homeless/ recently-paroled guys at the bar, survey the 1986 rear-projection TV that sat in front of two shredded sofas that were too ripped-up to stay in the ' 73 Rambler they came out of, then mumble a quiet apology to the seemingly-friendly owner, who was yelling at his kids as they played on the sticky carpet, and seemed just as surprised to have a client walk in as the rest of the `` clientele''.</li><li>It 's basic bar grub like wings and rings which are absolutely outstanding as I know the owner uses fresh oil for it.</li><li>The owner is friendly and the regulars are ready to engage in bar talk.</li><li>It has been in business for many years, and the owner has a lifetime of experience in the hospitality industry ... and he is a funny and pleasant man working alone.</li><li>The owner then assembles your order from the steam table.</li><li>The owner was friendly which I can appreciate but we 're not going back there again.</li><li>This lady had to be at least a supervisor or could very well be the owner.</li><li>ONE OF THE WORSE SPOTS AT YORK! first: its pricey! second: their staff are the rudest especially the blonde lady that owns it and her red hair companion! third: i do feel the owner is a racist lady, I have seen enough situations especially with specific backgrounds and things that happened to my friends that proves it.</li><li>The owner will also come out to take care of his customers when he 's not tied up in the kitchen.</li><li>Owner is super friendly guy who chats with you and comes over to ask you if everything is ok.</li><li>The owner, trying to be funny, said to my friend, `` What 's a white guy doing here ?</li><li>The owner is super nice and likes to chat when it is n't busy, which is rare- there 's usually a line up in there.</li><li>There was an order the owner was doing of 9 jerk chicken dinners so apparently jerk chicken is a hit!</li><li>It 's service with a smile and to top it off the owner is uber nice.</li><li>The staff &amp; owner are warm and friendly and the food is delicious!</li><li>The reviews stating that the owner is a crazy person are definitely accurate.</li><li>The owner rudely told us that they were closing soon so we would have to order immediately, he gave us the menus and 10 seconds later asked us if we were ready to order.</li><li>I moved downtown but if I 'm ever in north york I always come here for the pcc. restaurant itself is a dive, owner is for sure a bit moody. whatever.</li><li>This owner is a nut job.</li><li>I wo n't go back because the value just is n't there, but moreso because even if the owner was having a bad day, he cannot treat people like he does .. ( plus after reading some of the other reviews, it does n't seem like he even cares if someone calls him out on his poor attitude).</li><li>We were served by the son of the owner who seems to have a very strict sense of customer appeasing attitude.</li><li>The owner is super friendly.</li><li>The owner was super nice and helpful and let me sample by touch and smell the Persian Saffron I was looking for before purchase.</li><li>The owner is usually there and the most friendly.</li><li>I 've been going to this place a few years now, I 'm not sure if it 's been going downhill lately or it just happened that the last few times I 've been here the quality of the meat was extremely fat ( even tho they usually cut the fat off) All in all it 's a good place for a huge deli sandwich but it 's not cheap Food is just ok, the owner was completely rude.</li><li>The food is not bad but I am giving it one star for obnoxious service because the server and owner hassled one of our party about sending back a dish.</li><li>Apparantly the owner who was a head chef in a renowned restaurant in hong kong before he moved here, you can taste the authenticity in his flavour.</li><li>Service: The staff is friendly and the owner is very down to earth.</li><li>Only thing I would recommend to the owner is to have the staff clean the windows and the front glass door.</li><li>The owner and staff are very friendly.</li><li>Pretty fresh sushi, a wide variety of choices and extremely nice owner!</li><li>My family is close friends with the owner and i know this place inside and out.</li><li>The owner is also very friendly and attentive, would definitely come here again with friends.</li><li>The owner is Syrian, of the original Armenian owner what is left is the name and few decor item.</li><li>The owner has Palestinian roots and serves fairly traditional food from that region.</li><li>Our server ( maybe the owner ?) gave me several extra pitas to go with my leftovers when he saw me trying to save our remaining scraps ( oops).</li><li>The Vaughan one just took the name and it is not the same owner.</li><li>I called the restaurant to book a table, the owner refused to take any reservation less than 6 people, and if you want to come here at 6pm, he said you just walk in because people do n't really show up till 6:30pm.</li><li>We were trying to be nice on a Christmas Eve and look past all that since it was a relatively busy night ( It 's a Christmas Eve, so the ' new' owner should have got more people working), but when the time came to pay for our food and leave, the owner was giving us a very arrogant attitude, saying, `` What do you want me to do about it ?'', not in a polite tone, to say the least.</li><li>The owner is okay.</li><li>Now that they got their customers LOCKED, they jacked up prices by a bit also the rice and salmon has changed to a lower quality, also the owner is very rude never says anything just walks around and bumps people on shoulders with no apologies.</li><li>Makes pick up much easier Ps do n't park right infront of the place, I got a 250 $ parking ticket there once while waiting for my food, and I was leaning on my car, the owner told me how they have got over 11 of those tickets.</li><li>I love the dog that hangs out outside ( I think his owner is probably a barista).</li><li>I think that since he knows the owner and the staff, we had a good dining experience here.</li><li>The owner was very kind and inviting.</li><li>No receipts are given ( huge red flag that tips probably do n't go towards servers) and the owner fails to have any sort of basic mannerisms.</li><li>Yes, the servers are nice, but the owner is a person of poor character and the food frankly, is not all that delicious and not worth it.</li><li>I 'm not sure whether the owner trains the employee to receive orders this way or the owner has no idea the staff is working like this.</li><li>The owner is also extremely nice and pleasant.</li><li>The owner was crazy nice and he always offered me new things to try.</li><li>Owner was prompt and polite in serving.</li><li>The owner always treats me and my colleague like family.</li><li>Great owner who is nice, talkative, thoughtful, and cares about his business and customers.</li><li>Food is ok, owner is Afghani so has little more Afghan style food but all in all its a fast food Shawarma and falafel place, nothing special really.</li><li>The owner must be really cheap.</li><li>The owner is n't too chatty/friendly but the service is ok.</li><li>My mom is friends with the owner, so I 've been going here since this place was opened ( maybe for 13 years ?)</li><li>The owner increased the value of the groupon and we had to tip and tax on the original amount.</li><li>The owner is pretty savage guy and servers, sushi bar chefs all very rude and pretty shitty overall.</li><li>The owner was friendly and inviting .... you could tell he really appreciated our business.</li><li>The owner is always polite and the service is great.</li><li>From what I understand the owner is not there.</li><li>Again if the owner was there maybe he 'd care more than his staff.</li><li>The owner is friendly and always in a good mood.</li><li>Stuff &amp; owner are very friendly people, fast service, price are very cheap, foods are not good as the others things, unfortunately.</li><li>The owner was the only slightly friendly person.</li><li>Always great pizza &amp; pasta, owner is super friendly and always remembers us when we come in.</li><li>A few times a couple of unexpected friends wanted to join our full table, so we asked for a couple of chairs to add to the table, or just to move to bigger table, but the owner refused.</li><li>The owner, lively and tank topped took great care of us and even gave us a free meatball sandwich after mistakingly giving us an extra veal ( not the worst mistake one could endure).</li><li>At the end of our meal, I made eye contact with I believe to be the owner, I nodded at him, and he actually nodded back, but not in a forced manner, but in a genuine pleasant and thanking manner.</li><li>The owner of the restaurant really know how to make the restaurant attractive ~ so try it!</li><li>The staff and owner are completely incompetent and like they have no interest in doing much of anything.</li><li>The owner even gave us complimentary bread with the eggplant dish!</li><li>I asked the owner which one was better, and he immediately said the loin of venison without giving a reason- was this because it was the more expensive dish ?</li><li>Food was spoil and the owner was rude and did n't refund or replace it.</li><li>The Owner has no manners or respect.</li><li>Nevertheless, the owner was able to take out meat from my dishes.</li><li>I 'll be back. maybe it 's just me but some of the stinkiest Asian foods out there always tend to have strong but tasty flavours to it. eventually u just get use to the smell but man this bean paste type soup is always welcome in my stomach. although the bowl ( $ 10) with rice does not appear very big it does fill you for a lunch meal. as mentioned in other reviews the service was good. def be back for lunch again soon. fantastic samgyeopsal !!!!!! although the price is a bit more expensive than other korean restaurant, the quality is not comparable. best quality for its price. the owner is super nice and his english is really good. he 's a fun person to talk too. the place is quite small but its never packed ( everytime when i visited) The gangster look alike owner is very nice and friendly.</li><li>The owner picked their pork belly provider as blind tasting testing their customers.</li><li>The owner ( ?) is extremely friendly and personable ( also speaks perfect English)- very eager to explain every item on the menu, which was a bit hard to read.</li><li>The owner is a very sweet man!</li><li>The server ( owner ?) was super helpful and they eventually worked it out, but apparently it 's a summer dish.</li><li>The owner here is absolutely amazing ...</li><li>This place is different- the owner takes the time out to explain each dish and also educates us on the difference between dishes and how it 's cook.</li><li>Good thing the man who helped us ( the owner ?) was really nice and patient about explaining everything to us, and he made us feel totally comfortable and welcome.</li><li>Owner is exceptionally nice and thoughtful- taking all the time: the world to explain every thing to you and following up to see if the food was satisfactory.</li><li>Chris Lee- the owner is very friendly and courteous.</li><li>The owner is really friendly and always checking if everything is ok.</li><li>Packed and busy because of it and services slows down as a result, but the owner is a true caring man who takes time to deliver personalized service, recommendation and assistance.</li><li>And the owner is fabulous!</li><li>I was with a bunch of Korean BBQ novices ( myself mostly included) so the owner took his time to explain the menu, the food, the culture, and more.</li><li>Chris, the owner, is quite friendly.</li><li>Now I suspect that it was intended for us to cook our OWN meal however, I do believe one of our dinner companions ( you know who you are!) actually guilted the owner into cooking it for us!;) The beef was seasoned nicely and cooked perfectly with onion, garlic, carrots and mushrooms.</li><li>The service is friendly as the owner is the one who handles the wait duties.</li><li>The menu looks shorter than the Harbor front location but they are good enough to include everything I like ~ Owner reads my mind I love the pan fried chicken dumplings.</li><li>Another server ( owner ?) took over.</li><li>But it gets a bit crowded and they try to send you upstairs but it 's a different store altogether even though probably same owner operating under a different name.</li><li>Once we entered the owner ( i 'm guessing) immediately remembered my husband and his friends ( 2 others) he was super friendly, sat us down and took our order after awhile.</li><li>The Owner needs to get a grip on this place fast .The service here has really taken a turn for the worst, our so called `` waitress'' had a horrible attitude the way she talked to us &amp; those other customers around us, was ridiculious &amp; the service as a whole was just plain slow &amp; bad.</li><li>The owner said they are doing some test runs for the extended hours.</li><li>I have called the restaurant to get reimbursed for my money, the owner still has not replied.</li><li>The owner is really outspoken and kind.</li><li>The owner is a chill guy.</li><li>Today, since I had my wisdom teeth taken out, i ordered the barszcz ( not sure how it is spelt there I 'm Polish and this is the way we spell it) and got a side of fried eggplant ( since it was easy to swallow) Very happy! the owner is an amazing warm welcoming man as well!</li><li>This place has been around for probably 10 years and the chefs have changed from time to time, but still the same owner ..</li><li>The owner is always around and makes everyone feel right at home.</li><li>There are only two servers, one of whom seems to be the owner and only hangs out by the kitchen to collect and distribute money for delivery, leaving one girl to get order, serve food, and clean up.</li><li>Do n't expect any service, though the owner who is usually behind the counter is always friendly, but expect a simple well made submarine sandwich.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
