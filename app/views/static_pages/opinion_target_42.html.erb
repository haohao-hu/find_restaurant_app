's all the tastes i grew up with. both sucuk and pastirma are delicious. so are the cheeses. however they are a little on the pricey side. if you 're looking for authentic turkish ingredients, this is

think it 's a little pricey for what you get, since there are n't a lot of expensive ingredients used, like say, meat.</li><li>Since we 're cutting out one of the most expensive ingredients in Chinese cooking -- shellfish like lobster, crab, abalone -- I would have expected the chef to choose ingredients that are finer or of higher quality or just special in some way to substitute.</li><li>Since we 're cutting out one of the most expensive ingredients in Chinese cooking -- shellfish like lobster, crab, abalone -- I would have expected the chef to choose ingredients that are finer or of higher quality or just special in some way to substitute.</li><li>I ordered a salmon salad which was very tasty and a nice sized portion but I told the owner I was allergic to some of the ingredients in the salad and to not add them in and not only did she not listen but when I had to send it back, as opposed to taking new ingredients as should be done with allergies, she picked out all the allergens.</li><li>Food was prepared fresh and all ingredients were superior quality.</li><li>The ingredients are definitely different.</li><li>Each dish was very tasty and the ingredients were fresh.</li><li>The flavor is agreeable and the yeah the ingredients taste fresh.</li><li>While the sandwiches are tasty and usually ready in reasonable time, I am not completely convinced about the quality of the ingredients ... but you ca n't have everything together I guess.</li><li>For $ 15.00 you can get a lot better with real and fresh ingredients.</li><li>Then last year they changed their menu, ingredients, and prices.</li><li>The garden salad is a hit with me, I worship anyone capable of throwing tasty home made dressing together, the lettuce is crispy fresh as are other ingredients which makes for an uplifting combination with the dressing.</li><li>However ... u know there 's a problem when the food u are consuming makes u believe they are just trying to cheap out on the ingredients.</li><li>A bonus, they used to carry an excellent gluten free crust without all the crap ( corn, soy and ingredients spelled with numbers and x 's ').</li><li>Seafood dishes are usually paired with zestier additions which this dish lacked, resulting in an unremarkable plate of loosely placed ingredients.</li><li>The ingredients are always fresh and everything always seems well-cooked ( eg, the meat is n't dry, etc.).</li><li>No extra charge for adding/changing ingredients- who does that in this day and age ?</li><li>I would recommend their soups for colder days since the ingredients ( and also the temperature) are warmer.</li><li>The walls are decorated with posters of drawings of the ingredients of samgyetang, and other menu items.</li><li>However, you can really taste the quality and freshness of the ingredients that they use in their cooking.</li><li>All the ingredients are so fresh and you can tell they do not skimp out on quality either.</li><li>They use very fresh ingredients and nothing is overly sweet or salty.</li><li>They said they could n't keep the price because the ingredients are getting expensive.</li><li>The best part is that the ingredients for each dish are visually represented on the wall, so you definitely know every aspect of the dish.</li><li>I LOVE THIS PLACE! a nice addition to the area, very fresh ingredients, ginseng soup is good but not overwhelming in ginseng.</li><li>The bibimbap had raw veal and mushrooms with all the other typically bibimbap ingredients.</li><li>This is food court chinese food, but with higher quality ingredients.</li><li>Good quality ingredients and friendly people.</li><li>Can be a little pricey but really the quality of ingredients is above most of the places in walking distance within the area.</li><li>Freshest ingredients.</li><li>There are not many Asian-style restaurants that include gluten-free options, but Spring Rolls does ( although not specified on the menu, the waitstaff are familiar with ingredients).</li><li>We ended up ordering two dishes that had the exactly same ingredients but one was more sour and less spicy than the other.</li><li>They are generous with how much spice and ingredients to add, and stayed true to the Sichuan dish identity.</li><li>This is one of the best Napoleon pizza you can find in neighborhood, you can realize there is no frozen ingredients in your first bite.</li><li>Since in Colombia, Arepa usually eaten as Breakfast or Afternoon snacks, so most of the Arepa here at Arepiando has cheese and eggs as the main ingredients!</li><li>The Chicken Cobb salad has all the components of a good salad with fresh ingredients, complementary dressing ( this one had a bit of a kick from a hint of mustard) and filled my tummy up.</li><li>You could taste the freshness through the ingredients and the portion size was just right.</li><li>Clean fresh ingredients.</li><li>Overall, space was great but the food lacked a balance of essential ingredients.</li><li>Further, the ingredients were clearly fresh.</li><li>The second time I came my server was this sweet younger lady who was patient enough to explain to me the various dishes and the ingredients.</li><li>I will never buy their food again !!! cheap place to get korean food but they use way too much msg. the interior is really old and dirty. but bc they use so much msg i got addicted to their kimchi fried rice. one of the lady 's washroom is alway broken ( i think they are fixing it on purpose) and their ingredients ( like packs of rice) are in the hall connected to the rear exit. i just find this place not clean. i 'd go somewhere else.</li><li>You would think that 's maybe a cop-out and just an excuse to skimp out on the primary ingredients but I can assure you that they do not do that.</li><li>Everything tasted average, The rolls are big, very little rice, almost too much ingredients inside and I 'm not sure all the flavours worked together.</li><li>Something in the way they bake it or the dough ingredients ...</li><li>The ingredients, sauce, seasoning and meat are terrible.</li><li>Whoever gave this place a good review was either really lucky that day because Santa brought this store fresh ingredients OR the reviewer has absolutely no idea what they 're talking about.</li><li>It was hot and full of ingredients, a lil messy but I 'm a fan of messy food, it 's usually the tastiest.</li><li>That said, the ingredients do n't taste super fresh.</li><li>The ingredients seem very old.</li><li>Have some business sense. the best sushi ever, the most unique rolls, quality ingredients, excellent staff and service, must come back !! puts sushi on the level of heaven.</li><li>The ingredients were n't fresh: soggy fish and bland overly frozen shimp in the tempura shimp.</li><li>In conclusion, this place is overpriced, food with terrible ingredients, and bland presentation.</li><li>I have always found the ingredients to be fresh and plentiful.</li><li>California Sandwiches does the same price, yet their ingredients are all fresh, and cooked properly, not a microwave.</li><li>The spice is just right and the ingredients are fresh.</li><li>I think most ingredients are done in house ( salsa, guacamole).</li><li>A good Amoy vermicelli should be 1) well distributed sweetness 2) savory ingredients 3) I like my vermicelli not too dry aka have some sauce to coat the noodles 4) piping hot IMO:- food was hot.</li><li>This was okay in terms of ingredients, but it was bland.</li><li>Tastes homemade and prepared with fresh ingredients.</li><li>I have been to the Yorkdale food court a zillion times and the ingredients &amp; meat are consistently fresh, flavorful, and well-cooked/prepared.</li><li>The service was super fast, two people ahead of me, waited 3 minutes and as I was deciding if I wanted less ice and sugar, they already started my drink, as soon as I said less sugar, less ice, all the ingredients are thrown into the mixer, and made.</li><li>Overall, everything was freshly prepared with the most basic of ingredients but very delicious.</li><li>I lived in Bangkok for 6 months and can say that the food here is almost comparable to what you would get in Thailand ( would be comparable if Thai Bistro was able to get the same fresh ingredients as you get in Thailand).</li><li>However I did feel that some ingredients were missing to dish as a whole.</li><li>The quality of the ingredients they use is not excellent, at least it was n't for the matcha bubble tea I ordered.</li><li>Missed a few important ingredients, i.e. no cloud ear mushroom, small pieces of cut up squid and some small clams.</li><li>Huge portions, all made with good ingredients.</li><li>In this case, it was almost like they boiled some rigatoni, threw in a couple ingredients from a can ( save for the rapini and left it as that.</li><li>The food is pretty bland though, regardless of the plentiful ingredients ( green/red peppers, mushrooms.zucchini, eggplant and chicken.)</li><li>There were three tacos and the ingredients were n't filled to the top.</li><li>Mediocore Thai using cheap ingredients and not much skill.</li><li>Linda 's does n't skimp on ingredients.</li><li>You get a soup ( you can taste the ingredients), vegetables, a whole box of rice with your choice of BBQ meat.</li><li>These were hardly the freshest ingredients and were topped with three huge chunks of tomatoes and a few slivers of cucumber.</li><li>Food tastes great, they do not skim on the ingredients, portion is generous, and prices are low.</li><li>The Chef Special Fried Rice with Scallop, Shrimp, BBQ pork and Preserved Sausage has its specialty but has different ingredients than the other restaurant if you do not read the description in English and order it under the Chinese name.</li><li>They offer super sized bowls of congee, and it also tasted pretty good with all of the ingredients they add to it.</li><li>Anyhow, the menus are great with lots of proper English and most of the ingredients are listed.</li><li>I especially loved the congee, soft and smooth with lots of ingredients.</li><li>Like the soup, the food portions are huge and the restaurant does not skimp on ingredients.</li><li>It was so amazing, in fact, that today, I bought the ingredients to attempt to make this at home.</li><li>Food is typical Asian fare although their menu indicates they have `` new taste'' section where some of the traditional dishes are experimental with some ingredients.</li><li>Aside from powered standards, if there 's a photo in the menu of organic ( as in once-living) ingredients, you can expect non-powdered ingredients.</li><li>Aside from powered standards, if there 's a photo in the menu of organic ( as in once-living) ingredients, you can expect non-powdered ingredients.</li><li>Not to mention every time I go there, my shirt gets smelly ( that does n't happen with other restaurants) which shows the bad restaurant set up and probably non-standard ingredients in their food ...</li><li>We ordered the only thing at Joons that they 're famous for- Dak Gal Bee- and this dish is served in a large pan with the ingredients cooked at the table, so be prepared to wait awhile to eat, which is tortuous for incredibly hungry patrons.</li><li>As for value, the basic is about $ 10/portion, but you have the option to add extra ingredients for a little extra $.</li><li>All the add-ons are not expensive ingredients, but the price can definitely add up per person.</li><li>The table-top cooking experience was interesting, but the staff are very unobtrusive when they come by to give the ingredients a quick stir and make sure everything is cooking along as it should.</li><li>They used to bring a hot burner to your table, put the ingredients in a large metal pan partially cooked and let you finish off the cooking.</li><li>Joon 's Special is the Dak Gal Bee ( a table-top burner with a large wok that cooks raw ingredients together) The cool thing about it is that unlike western restaurants, the food was cooked right at our table by our waitress instead of being served already cooked.</li><li>The food itself was pretty good; the ingredients were fresh and they were n't stingy with them either.</li><li>There 's a variety of food and also a variety of ingredients to make your sauce.</li><li>However, when they falter on the execution and skimp on the quantity of ingredients it 's maddening.</li><li>They were all great and similar to rolls of those kinds I 've had in the past, however I noticed they used a small amount of rice and more ingredients inside the roll which is definitely appreciated.</li><li>MOST IMPORTANTLY- FRESH ingredients.</li><li>The rice portion is Just right In a roll with lots of ingredients which makes the roll super huge.</li><li>Sometimes there is a lot of rice but it 's not to the detriment of the quantity of the other ingredients so the worst case is that you have to leave some rice on the side to get the perfect ratio.</li><li>They do n't skimp out on the ingredients and the fish is decent and fresh.</li><li>They really do n't skimp out on their ingredients.</li><li>Both rolls had a good ratio of rice to ingredients- which is a bonus for me because I hate when restaurants add so much rice and you can barely taste what is inside the roll!</li><li>The dynamite rolls are ginormous and the ingredients are really fresh.</li><li>The dynamite roll and spicy salmon are my go to rolls and they are deliciously huge and stuffed with ingredients.</li><li>I love that Sushi Bong does not cheap out on the ingredients they stuff inside each roll.</li><li>Ordered the red dragon roll- it was stuffed to the brim with ingredients and very filling!</li><li>This is your answer Hand made and pulled noodles with a wide variety of options to serve all tasted Pretty much every bowl is under ten bucks so not a tough decision to make However there is only seating for 14 customers so it 's a bit of a bolt hole but worth the wait to grab a seat Great service and great food My dish had wide flat noodles and had the right amount of chew to them and it 's a huge portion All ingredients were fresh and it felt odd I was the only gaijin in the place where the waitress kept trying to explain to me how to eat ..... no I know chopsticks yeah h-mart yes noodles .... hahaha.</li><li>I ordered the Biang Biang Mian, as it was one of the recommended items and the ingredients attracted me.</li><li>When food arrived it was missing half the ingredients ( no mushrooms/onions).</li><li>Why prepare something if you do n't have the right ingredients ?</li><li>I really enjoyed the dip that came with it, which ingredients were not listed.</li><li>The Asian server with glasses did n't smile and did n't seem very enthusiastic, smile and I would have given a tip:) Hard to understand the menu since everything is in Italian, it took 5 min of studying the ingredients to understand what was on the menu.</li><li>Huge portion and very generous amount of ingredients.</li><li>Boo Daw Jung Gol ~ Kimchi hotpot with all the ingredients you can think of and it will varied from restaurants. ~ Here, there 's beansprout, sausage, spam, mushrooms, veggies and of course the instant noodle. ~ It 's as if you raid the fridge in the middle of the night for things to add to your instant noodle. ~ This is the ultimate dish to end a rather heavy drinking night;) Dduk Bok Gi ( Spicy Rice Cake) ~ With fish cake slices, all immerse in a thick spicy sauce. ~ Filling, yummy and cheap dish that I will never get tired of.</li><li>Nothing can go wrong with the combination of these ingredients; they are made for each other!</li><li>If you prefer an even bigger dessert that is going to fill you up, you can take all of the ingredients of the crepe and put them on a waffle instead!</li><li>They finished the pizza quickly and did n't skimp on the ingredients.</li><li>The ingredients are getting non existent.</li><li>Presentation was nice, ingredients fresh however quantity was a touch light for the price.</li><li>The ingredients were loosely scattered on top of the sushi rice.</li><li>Was quite impressed with the service, fresh ingredients and cozy atmosphere.</li><li>The ingredients are always fresh, the cooking is never sloppy.</li><li>Lack of ingredients.</li><li>And the food were also very bad as the shrimp and meat were both very cheap quality ingredients I will never come here again knowing there are much better choices in the same area.</li><li>A good amount of ingredients and a very good sauce to go with.</li><li>The ingredients were plentiful as always and the service was not the most friendly but definitely not rude and efficient!</li><li>The menu is small with options for the types of ingredients with the soft tofu and the spiciness level.</li><li>They have about 4 or 5 different tofu soups but they are essentially the same wi slightly different ingredients.</li><li>Without me even asking, the server noticed and asked if I had any allergies and then got a chef to cook with separate ingredients on another iron griddle!</li><li>All the ingredients seem to somehow be packed evenly in the burrito so you do n't get bites that are either only mostly lettuce or mostly meat filling.</li><li>Portion size was decent, but I suppose that 's easy to manage when your ingredients are so average.</li><li>I know this, because the other half of Nino D' aversa is set up like a bakery/small grocery store, where you can get all kinds of imported and local ingredients to stock your pantry full of italian goods.</li><li>The food is certainly overpriced, but the food is decent and the ingredients are fresh.</li><li>But then again, chain restaurants are usually a disappointment for my diva- palettes Some friends that used to work at BP once told me all their ingredients are frozen out of a box.</li><li>For the price I pay, their dish is so small and does n't have a lot of ingredients.</li><li>Do n't expect Michelin starred inspired techniques or ingredients.</li><li>I would have loved a little more noodles in this dish, in fact, a little more of all ingredients would have been awesome ( except the meat, there was a good amount of that).</li><li>FYI has a lot of the same ingredients as bulgogi so Id get one or the other The only thing bringing the stars down is that .... they forgot to pack the kimchi, which made me feel very very sad.</li><li>Otherwise, full of tasty and well-prepared ingredients ( the tofu was brilliant) and worth it.</li><li>This shows that they are cooking using authentic methods using traditional ingredients.</li><li>It is big, and they do not skim on the ingredients.</li><li>Not only have I tried ordering from the gluten sensitive page, she was not able to confirm or the knowledge that the staff and the kitchen are prepared and/or trained as they should be to prepare the food properly and check the ingredients in certain premade items such as bacon.</li><li>I got a rice-based dinner; all the ingredients tasted fresh, though I felt the sauce was applied too heavily.</li><li>Bimimbap is vegetables/meat on top of rice and you basically mix the ingredients together before eating.</li><li>Not an overload of rice amongst other ingredients.</li><li>You can tell they use very fresh ingredients.</li><li>I usually do n't like salads but the `` ME salad'' was exceptionally great and the ingredients complimented each other well.</li><li>I 've experienced things like dry patties, overcooked dry fries, stale-tasting buns and other ingredients.</li><li>The ingredients are so unbelievably fresh and tasty.</li><li>It sounded like it would be a strange sauce with all the different ingredients, but it turned out to be quite tasty.</li><li>And the ingredients did n't seem to be of the best quality.</li><li>For instance, the steamed rice rolls ( pulverized rice liquid steamed into a flat sheet, wrapped around shrimp or other ingredients and then re-steamed) were sticky and thick.</li><li>- Costly/unique ingredients ( e.g. baby yu-choy) are cooked using basic preparations ( e.g. just boiled or steamed and served straight-up) and ordered only `` by chance'' ( i.e. not on the menu) as waitstaff walk with trays of plastic bowl-covered plates.</li><li>All the ingredients were so well flavoured.</li><li>I often order this dish as a small meal or a tie-over and Thai One On always uses hearty, fresh ingredients.</li><li>The bad part about this place is n't necessarily with the chef, but with the ingredients they have.</li><li>It looked very appetizing in the menu, with all the good ingredients.</li><li>I could n't tell if there was any of the listed ingredients, but there was something resembling eggplant ( overlooked).</li><li>The ingredients were fresh, the taste was delicious, and the service was very friendly.</li><li>The chicken was a bit small but the rest of the ingredients meshed together still made for a pretty good sandwich.</li><li>A fave of mine is the french onion soup- lots of ingredients in there which could be a meal in itself.</li><li>The idea here is that once you 've cobbled together what you think would be a tantalizing concoction of ingredients you hand over the cooking duties to the men at the grill.</li><li>Love the `` choose your ingredients and we cook it fresh for you'' side of this place.</li><li>I think what I like most about this place is that theres many different things you can try- sauces, ingredients, etc and every time it tastes a little different ... now if your boring, i guess your selection will be boring, but eating here gives you an opportunity to eat something a little different and taste the various flavours from Mongolia ?</li><li>I am one of many who love the Mongolian Grill concept, where you pick your own ingredients, meats or seafood, add tons of fresh veggies, plus noodles, sauces, and condiments, and hand your choices off to the chefs who will sizzle it up for you, on their 700 degree flat top.</li><li>You can put as many different ingredients as your want into a bowl, and then the chef will cook it on top of this huge circular iron stove top!</li><li>Food was cooked quickly however I felt the grill master added a tad too much water to the ingredients while cooking everything and watered down my sauces a little.</li><li>I mean if it tastes awful it is hardly the restaurant 's fault since you put the ingredients together.</li><li>You select the ingredients you want to use, and they are cooked while you wait.</li><li>I really like creating my own bowls with all of the ingredients that they offer.</li><li>The Mongolian grill is the `` feature'' of the restaurant, where you assemble your own ingredients and the grill-master dude cooks it on a giant circular grill.</li><li>The ingredients were varied and plentiful.</li><li>It 's got the traditional Mongolian Bbq with a vast choice of ingredients, as well as another 3 rows of chinese, fusion, buffet style.</li><li>However after they took my order, the staff came back twice telling me that they ran out of ingredients for two dishes I ordered.</li><li>I usually avoid fried rice, but I found the eel fried rice to be my favorite dish- the individual ingredients blended well together, and the eel meat just made each bite better.</li><li>It 's balanced flavor- not too strong or weak- and just the right amount of ingredients.</li><li>Most places just cook a giant pot of plain congee and then add the ingredients to order.</li><li>The good places spend some extra time cooking the plain congee with the ingredients you chose so that the ingredient flavors are imparted to the plain congee.</li><li>They did not cheap out on the ingredients and the omelette was stuffed with sausage, peameal bacon, ham, and cheddar cheese.</li><li>I like it ... actually to me it seems like a cross between Ramen and Korean Soup ... its a little spicy, and has a bunch of different ingredients ( as well as the typical stuff, it has mushrooms, bean sprouts, carrots, etc).</li><li>The biggest difference I find between the places is the quality of the noodle and ingredients.</li><li>While the staff is friendly and the ingredients fresh, it 's nothing out of this world.</li><li>It 's proof that the food is much more than the individual ingredients.</li><li>It 's the quality of the ingredients that makes it so good.</li><li>Also, at subway you ca n't even see the ingredients in the sandwich ..</li></ol></div><ul
