Sheppard and she lives in Markham.</li><li>After long and very embarrassing negotiating, we had concluded that I will not be eating at this location ever again.</li><li>Pros:- Location is very accessible by TCC ( on Yonge, just south of Finch Station)- The variety of those little side dishes is astounding!</li><li>This location I will not return to.</li><li>Good location.</li><li>The Location.</li><li>This location replaced Max Convenience Store and rightfully gained the status of landmark-ing this corner like a BOSS!</li><li>This location I came to was actually pretty cramped inside.</li><li>The location is clean, and well ventilated so your not gonna be too smelly.</li><li>My second biggest disappointment was that this location does n't have that ice shaver with all the sweet toppings as the P-Mall location does !! ( I know this one does n't really count but I used to come here just for that haha).</li><li>This location also has the biggest portions.</li><li>However, this location is probably the smallest so expect to wait for a table during busy hours at dinner time.</li><li>Their food, portions, price and location is bang on!</li><li>This location is incredibly fast at serving the food though, faster than the other Congee Wong locations.</li><li>Quaint location friendly atmosphere and reasonable prices !!</li><li>The location is close to where I live and there was no delivery charge, though I was asked to tip the driver ( odd, no ?).</li><li>This location is closed on Tuesdays.</li><li>This location is a much small place, parking available at the back of the business.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
