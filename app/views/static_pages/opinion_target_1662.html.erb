<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1662' %><h2>avocado tempura<br />occurrence: 2</h2><div><ol><li>The tempura was ok, nothing special ( they had avocado tempura which is fairly unique).</li><li>Overall, just a crappy experience. been here only few times and always for lunch. lunch options are very good and at least vegetarian options are pretty cheap ( tofu bento box + soup + salad = $ 7). the food is yummy! and they have some interesting appetizers like avocado tempura! which is just delicious! the staff is friendly and helpful.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
