<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 625' %><h2>smoked meat sandwich<br />occurrence: 6</h2><div><ol><li>I always feel like having a little nitrate nap right after but that is truly the sign of a great smoked meat sandwich.</li><li>When we finally made it there on a Sunday morning, we had the corned beef sandwich, smoked meat sandwich, with coleslaw, potato salad and pickles.</li><li>I believe the person who served us was the owner and he was really nice with answering questions ( which is the best sandwich, what is the most popular, which one is your favourite) prepared or super quickly and it came with a generous serving of deli meat, and it was yummmmmmmy! 5 stars: great smoked meat sandwich, and they offer it in a combo with slaw.</li><li>Mind you, every place I 've had a smoked meat sandwich before, they 've always asked `` lean, medium or fatty ?''</li><li>Overall had a decent experience here, you would defineately need to come here to try it out if you never had a smoked meat sandwich before.</li><li>We ordered and the food was out shortly, as my mother ordered the Montreal smoked meat sandwich ( as it is her favourite anywhere we go), there was something quite rancid tasting about the meat, it had an odd smell and colour to the meat, as we were already in a rush from waiting so long for service we would n't have had time to choose another menu item/send it back, but that would not have mattered since our server did not come by once to check on how the food was.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
