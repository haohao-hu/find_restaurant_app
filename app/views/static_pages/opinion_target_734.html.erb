<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 734' %><h2>crust pizza<br />occurrence: 5</h2><div><ol><li>Over all, a nice place but if we come back, we 'll be sure to order something different next time! ok it 's no fluke the wood oven pizza here is very good. ( we ordered two kinds to try) the dough, sauce and cheese the base ingredients of most any pizza are top notch. the crust i would describe .. it 's not a thin where it 's paper thin and it 's not cooked crisp like I 've had at many other thin crust pizza places. having its so crisp hides the true identity of the pizza dough. how can one taste the crust if it 's burnt !? the crust is thin where one can bite into the dough know it 's dough and not thick enough to not overwhelm the toppings. my quattro stagione was made wrong though .. it suppose to be separate quarters of pizza with the individual toppings. but instead it was a pizza with all the toppings. c 'mon just because I do n't look italian does n't mean I do n't know how it 's suppose to be. do n't give me stupid excuses that things get roughed up in the oven that why that make it that way ? i do n't care for the chatty waitress here and the ridiculous excuses, but as i mentioned in my first review. i will come here for the food because the cooks and chefs in the back know what they are doing ..</li><li>We got the stuffed crust pizza and it tasted great and it was still warm!</li><li>I even love sicilian style thick crust pizza, but the crust needs to be a tender foccacia style, not a chewy, doughy mess.</li><li>After waiting for unreasonable amount of time, we ordered a medium stuffed crust pizza and two pints of beer.</li><li>My stuffed crust pizza was a hard, gross pizza which seemed like they stuck REFRIGERATED solid cheese sticks in the pizza.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
