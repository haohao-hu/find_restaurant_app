<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 66' %><h2>space<br />occurrence: 117</h2><div><ol><li>The seating space is pretty good, easy to fit a small group of people.</li><li>Still there 's free wifi and ample space inside.</li><li>South St. Burger does make burgers better. you do have to pay more to get more though. some of the distinguishing features are: hormone free beef patty- thicker and juicier than McD/Wendys bun choice of white or whole wheat toppings from gourmet ketchup, mustard, mayonaise, cheeses accompanying fries are NY Fries Cost is ~ $ 10 for a regular burger meal ( burger/fries/soft drink) but the taste is more satisfying than McD/Wendys something of this higher caliber class is like Hero Burger The space is well lit, building is a corner unit with variety of seating to suit your fancy, a choice of rounded booths, to conventional tables and bar seating along the windows edge.</li><li>Threw my kids party here as they have a good space for large groups.</li><li>A beautifully small and intimate space.</li><li>Good use of the space!</li><li>She can also tell some people to wait in the outside area after they got their number and they could have cleared the space.</li><li>They were taking too much space.</li><li>The space itself is quite intimate with a minimalistic interior design.</li><li>However it is a very small space.</li><li>Nice hidden space tucked in a side street.</li><li>The space is dim and quiet.</li><li>Overall, space was great but the food lacked a balance of essential ingredients.</li><li>Terrible time driving into the plaza from the far side of the busy road because not all drivers in the opposing lane leave you a space to get through when the traffic stops at the red light: JERKS!</li><li>Excellent variety of food and sushi and the space is cozy but inviting.</li><li>The space looks like it can be converted into a party room pretty easily.</li><li>If you feel like dining in, Tutto 's is an intimate and rustically cozy space and perfect for either a date or to meet up with a group of friends.</li><li>We went to check the space because a few yelpers and reviewers from other sites claimed there was n't any MSG in this pho ( the quest of my life), turns out they were wrong.</li><li>Enough space between each table.</li><li>They do n't have much space to work with, but tables are very close from one another.</li><li>Also, the space is small, and located in a busy plaza, so it 's always fairly crowded.</li><li>CON: Place is too tight, they have a tiny space.</li><li>Small space, gets wicked busy here during lunch.</li><li>The space despite being in a basement, it offers an intimacy that is conductive to a date night.</li><li>Keep in mind that Karl also believes that he can court women with the animated space bunnies on his Gelaskin. [ 2 ] So either Karl is a genius, or he is wrong about everything.</li><li>This restaurant used to be much larger, but even after downsizing the space &amp; menu a little bit, they have remained consistently good!</li><li>After another 20 minutes of waiting patiently, the manager came to our table to tell us to move seats so another customer could squeeze into the already tight space.</li><li>Although this particular location is a bit small and cramped, the great food and atmosphere make up for the lack of space.</li><li>There were a few people waiting around in a really small space with narrow alley.</li><li>This ChaTime is also sort of cramped in space- very narrow and limited seating area.</li><li>Staff were really friendly:) This place is very busy though since it also shares the same space as Bake Code.</li><li>I wish the space was larger as well, it seems to always be busy.</li><li>Great food, nice booth style seating, but limited space.</li><li>I thought, let 's call the Bier Market to see if they have space instead of walking there, called them- they had space.</li><li>I thought, let 's call the Bier Market to see if they have space instead of walking there, called them- they had space.</li><li>RESERVATIONS I could see that they would be required during peak dining times because the space is n't too big.</li><li>Setting was a little tight out there as they had heat lamps taking up some space.</li><li>The huge space is inhabited by lovely and mostly elderly ( a good sign to stay) and obviously hungry people enjoying a break from work.</li><li>It 's a very large space.</li><li>Aside from the garish design of the space ( I 'm all for re-purposing, but this IS supposed to be a deli ...) the place has a whiff of authenticity.</li><li>If you can endure waiting a really long time during peak hours inside a cramped space heated to sauna temperatures by steam trays, then you are a real Jerk .. fan.</li><li>Really small space.</li><li>The space itself has been home to three prior restaurants that has all gone out of business, the height of the chairs make you wish you 've brought a phone book to sit on so that you have the right chair-to-table elevation, and the decor makes as much sense as the leaders the Liberal Party picks to run their campaign.</li><li>This place I noticed was quite the quiet joint even with all the space they had.</li><li>Decor, space, and service were all amazing BUT the food was n't ( mind you this is dependent if you fancy Mongolian cuisine) I surprisingly found the curry fish to taste scrumptious but other items such as friend potato and noodles to be bland and in some cases very oily I would recommend this for someone craving traditional Chinese cuisine but if you are like me who enjoy Hakka style more I would avoid this place.</li><li>I hope they keep making improvements, because they have plenty of space to work with.</li><li>The fries are delicious, but often just act as filler, wasting space that could be used for falafel!</li><li>Lots of space ...</li><li>The space is somewhat clean, family friendly and even suitable for non-Chinese speaking folks.</li><li>Facility: Decor is outdated and space is very cramped.</li><li>I do n't mind a loud space, but having someone standing a foot next to me while I eat and talk is irritating.</li><li>Tight space with 3 mini tables.</li><li>Definitely not a sit-down restaurant as the space is limited but this place is more about good price and speedy service.</li><li>Totally expected in such a small space.</li><li>We had a group of 7 and we pretty much covered more than half the floor space.</li><li>It might not sound that bad but factor in the small space, heavy bowls, and being super busy, it 's a bit of a challenge.</li><li>Due to the lack of space, my parents and I had to wait outside the restaurant.</li><li>The space is small, so do n't expect to get a seat there.</li><li>Decor/Atmosphere: Its a small, very tight space with minimal seating.</li><li>Space is clean and the decor is nice.</li><li>The restaurant is a nice space.</li><li>She was in my way and it was a very tight space so I said `` excuse me''.</li><li>I had to pushed the chair along while maneuvering out of the tight space.</li><li>However the table was quite small and made our eating space quite tight ... maybe we should have only ordered one type of dish.</li><li>The space is small and is n't really good for large groups.</li><li>The space is quite small, it does n't fit that many people ( about 20 ?)</li><li>This little caf√© on Yonge and Finch looks big on the outside, as they do have a patio, however there are only about 3 booths inside as the rest of the space are being taken up by their display and cashier spots.</li><li>Even though it 's a small space, the staff are cool with lingering and are attentive with refilling water.</li><li>Latte is always great Service is decent Cons: Can get very busy depending on the time Very small space One washroom.</li><li>Space is limited and a little tight for the average person .. = P We ended up ordering crepes, matcha tea and another special tea that you do n't normally see elsewhere ... we were overall very impressed with the service and food quality ..</li><li>A small space, packed on Sunday night.</li><li>The space is very clean ( they wipe down all the chairs, even the bar where you put your foot!) with very attentive staff.</li><li>Went here on a Tuesday night with a party of 8 and they were able to accommodate us in their cute and quaint space.</li><li>Before I start talking about the food, this is the cutest place ever*-* it 's not exactly big, but the space is so well decorated, and everything is so pretty and the staff are so nice and ARGH I CAN' T EVEN. anyways. onto the foooood the menu is pretty small, and everything on it is around $ 8-10 dollars.my mom and I split a savoury one first ( mushroom).</li><li>Small space, so very crowded at times.</li><li>They have a very nice space at this location, lots of seating and natural light.</li><li>If you are uncomfortable by gazes or jostles from strangers, seek another venue to satisfy your personal space.</li><li>Small space with an almost private-ish section for parties up to eight, for people who would come to such a place when in a group.</li><li>Menu was pretty exhaustive and lots to choose from and lots of space in the restaurant it seems.</li><li>Great for take out as the space is not as appetizing as the food.</li><li>Make us feel like we are a nuisance because we take up too much space ( more about this later).</li><li>Whenever I get there before the rest of my party the lady there always makes me feel like I 'm just taking up space.</li><li>Been here before but most recently I came here on a Sunday night and it was not crowded but we were seated at a tiny table in the back which gave us very little space to eat considering all the dishes involved.</li><li>The seating is very clustered so there is very little space to move through when getting to your table and leaving.</li><li>Only thing I hate about this location is the lack of space, it fills up quickly and I have had to turn back twice when I came by with my gf.</li><li>They lost 1 star for the space.</li><li>Although I did n't use their parking lot, parking space is available at the back.</li><li>It is n't so typical to have parking space available to yonge street.</li><li>- Good Space ?</li><li>Akin to the downtown location, it has an orangy interior, mirrors on the walls to give an illusion of larger space, burn marks on the table surfaces, tea never voluntary filled.</li><li>It 's as if the management deliberately designed the space to maximize ' turns'.</li><li>I was worried there 'd be a lot of air space given the size of the puffs but they turned out to be well-filled.</li><li>There is a nice flow at this eatery, a line-up queue made separate from the seating area with ample space.</li><li>There was really no space to line up to order because they set up tables right in front of the cashiers.</li><li>The space inside the restaurant was inviting and comfortable.</li><li>- Good Space ?</li><li>One can feel relaxed here, as the space drowns any outside noise.</li><li>Crammed space.</li><li>Also because of the tight space waiters were slower because they had to wait until someone passed.</li><li>Do n't get turned off by it 's dated decor and cramped space, it 's some of the best sushi I 've had.</li><li>I reckon the space would allow for an intimate wedding reception of approximately 80 guests.</li><li>Great little space; nicely decorated, and you can watch the chef make noodles by hand which is kinda cool.</li><li>I had been wanting to try this place since I had found out the space was being turned into a restaurant.</li><li>An Irish pub occupies the space and the switch was literally and figuratively done overnight.</li><li>With 25 seats, this is n't a large space.</li><li>Their space is a bit small-ish.</li><li>They renovated the small space, and it 's shiny, white and sparkly.</li><li>Decor 4/5 Nice clean contemporary space.</li><li>The space upstairs ( the lounge) is where high school kids come to get some beer in hopes that their IDs wo n't be checked, and in most cases it works.</li><li>I do n't know how long this place has occupied their space, but from the decor, I have a feeling that this place used to be something else.</li><li>This ai n't Los Angeles, why would anyone dedicate a giant floor space to sushi with so much competition ?</li><li>The space looks like an old retro diner and is pretty busy during weekday lunches.</li><li>They 're always eager to clean off your table once they notice you 've stopped eating .. first, we got a table that was highly uncomfortable, the seats felt shitty that we were/felt sunken in .... space is cramped .... just not comfy at all ... and food sucked .. i ordered a eggs florentine ... equivalent to a vegetarian eggs benedict, basically the same hollandaise sauce .... but it was o so shitty ... my friend ordered a club sandwich ... the bread looked like whole wheat wonderbread .. c-r-a-p. ( review for the bathurst &amp; sheppard location).</li><li>Very spacious and ample space between tables.</li><li>Do n't be afraid to fill up your bowl with ingredients since it will take up less space after cooking.</li><li>Also, bring cash and you pay at the cashier. soooooo, did you hear about what happened to the goldsteins ? how about the shmaltzbergs son michael, i heard he got an earring! no ? really. what a hoodlum. oy a broch. this might make virtually no sense to you at all or it might make all too much sense to you and either way when you are eating in the cramped space that is bagel plus youll hear this conversation in any number of incarnations at much louder decibel levels than in this review. right at the lip of one of torontos jewish areas ( spanning from as far south as eglinton you might say to as far north as sheppard all along bathurst as its spine) sits this boisterous place thats half bakery and takeaway and half sit down. there are classic chopped eggs, tuna, lox, cream cheese, and herring. then they have a bit of middle eastern flair with falafel plates. the falafel are huge and crispy. they also, make a great spinach salad with a huge ice cream scoop of chopped egg- im sure you can get a huge scoop of just about anything on it. and just about anything you get, will come with, as you would expect, a nice big bagel. i always enjoy my food whenever i go- the menu has long been set and they do it well, but i could do with a little less all the bar mitzvah talk. but when in poland ...</li><li>I even remember when they had Space Invaders!</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
