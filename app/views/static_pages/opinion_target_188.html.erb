<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 188' %><h2>ramen<br />occurrence: 27</h2><div><ol><li>MAJORLY overpriced, tiny portions, tasteless ramen ... worse than instant noodles.</li><li>It 's slightly absurd to me how a bowl of instant ramen is like $ 3 when it 's $ 0.50 a bowl at the Asian supermarket, ( what ?).</li><li>The ramen was good, but it lacked flavour.</li><li>The ramen was a seafood ramen, but I got a total of one piece of ( frozen, still cold) shrimp and two minuscule pieces of mussel.</li><li>I can barely found any seafood there and the instant ramen is just as good as what my Yelp friend have been making for me.</li><li>Dak galbi ( marinated chicken stir-fry on hot plate- traditionally dark meat chicken is used, but I do n't know what kind they use here) is their specialty but a la carte menu is offered too. banchan has the usual napa cabbage kimchi, beansprouts, but the one i especially like is their simple but good steamed broccoli with a dash of gochujang. personally i like gochujang with everything, but it may not be fore everyone. they also have a mashed potato banchan which i did not try. if your order the dak galbi, i recommend extra orders of tteok ( rice cake sticks), sweet potato and pumpkin. cheese ( looks and tastes like mozzarella) is offered too, giving it a fusion/modern twist. ramen is also on the menu. service is attentive, friendly and pleasant. quite a roomy restaurant, which is surprising if you merely look from the outside. unlike many other korean restaurants in toronto, you can actually linger here for a while, given enough seating for everyone. will DEFINITELY come again.</li><li>Only downside is that the ramen was a tad dry.</li><li>The ramen is the best that I have had in Toronto.</li><li>The service is quick and ramen is amazing as well!</li><li>While vacationing in Toronto, Canada around the winter time ( November time frame to be exact), I wanted some decent ramen and Takoyaki balls.</li><li>My ramen was decent for not actually being in Japan but the Takoyaki balls were on point.</li><li>The `` house special'' ramen is the one that comes in milky pork-bone broth.</li><li>This is definitely the best ramen I 've had in GTA so far.</li><li>They have authentic okonomiyaki that they make fresh and serve on a sizzling platter with all the fixings. their gyoza is fresh and cooked to perfection. their takoyaki ( round pancake balls with a piece of octopus) is authentic and fresh too. less soup base options to ajisen, but if you find the equivalent here, you should find that it is less salty, less msg. being korean run, seeing any kimchi or pickled radish actually makes sense, and i think there is kalbi ( korean beef short ribs) on the menu as well. their service is not fast, and this place can be quite busy at times, but if you want ramen and you are not downtown on dundas or queen street, this is the best ramen you can get. i can vouch for the quality and consistency of this particular location, dunno about other Kenzo locations. i miss the tempura they used to have at this location, but it was taken off the menu. if you want an authentic bowl of ramen or okonomiyaki that is the closest thing to getting to Japan and having one there, this is the place if you are uptown.</li><li>The ramen here is awesome!</li><li>Most of their ramen here is tasty and i doubt you 'll be disappointed.</li><li>The ramen was spicy and the pork pieces were melt in your mouth delicious.</li><li>Decent ramen but afterwards, our group of 4 were wickedly tired and thirsty.</li><li>The ramen was just okay, nothing to write home about, however, the service was dismal.</li><li>Anyhow, the ramen is pretty good.</li><li>So when there is good udon and pho nearby, why should you settle for overpriced, underfilling, simply OK ramen ?</li><li>Nice place, good ramen.</li><li>No nonsense atmosphere with a focus on quality, fresh and hearty ramen.</li><li>I like the one on Yonge better. we had king of king ramen. the ramen was so yummy and spicy. the `` chasu'' ( BBQ pork) and noodle are tender and chewy. specially the grilled mark chasu, not too dry and gave u a miso soup flavour.</li><li>I always cringe when I hear people touting Ajisan as `` good ramen'' ..</li><li>Your ramen looks very close to the pictures in the menu you ordered from.</li><li>The basic ramen was excellent.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
