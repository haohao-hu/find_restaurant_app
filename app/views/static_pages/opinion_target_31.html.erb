<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 31' %><h2>fries<br />occurrence: 245</h2><div><ol><li>Sandwich was okay, the fries were somewhat raw still.</li><li>The curried chicken is quite good and definitely a favourite of mine at this place however, this week I was craving their cheeseburger and fries.</li><li>Their fries are reminiscent of McDonald 's fries but with way less salt. which actually makes them better.</li><li>No brainer choice for quick lunch if you do n't want those burger and fries ..</li><li>The sandwich was a good size for the price ( special $ 8.95) and came with fries and coleslaw.</li><li>The fries were pretty standard pub fare.</li><li>They also have really excellent chunky fries, however if choosing between fries and salad, I always go salad.</li><li>They also have really excellent chunky fries, however if choosing between fries and salad, I always go salad.</li><li>I especially like their chicken fingers and french fries.</li><li>My fries were so bland and tasteless.</li><li>Pretty good fries too, thick cut.</li><li>The prices are alright, seafood platter which is like a sampler of seafood + halibut is around 16, comes with fries and salad.</li><li>Upon entering the establishment, we ordered 1 ( one) pitcher of Heineken, 1lb of peppercorn wings + fries, and another 1lb of honey garlic wings + fries.</li><li>9:20pm) we approached the nearest server and politely informed her that we were still awaiting the second order, the one that consisted of 1lb of honey garlic wings + fries.</li><li>Upon consuming the one pitcher of beer and devouring the 2lbs of wings and fries, we were approached by a server in regards to the bill, and we mutually relayed the notion of splitting the bill- the price of the pitcher would be covered by my colleague, and I would pay for the 2lbs of wings + fries.</li><li>Wings were good but the fries were not even fries, they were crumbly bits.</li><li>The fries were battered and tossed in the house special Rose sauce.</li><li>The place suppose to be Persian food but it seemed more American to me as it is all fries, pizza and subs.</li><li>However, the most ingenious idea South Street does is server you New York Fries my favorite type of fries!</li><li>Love their burgers .... so-so on their fries ( even though they 're New York Fries) Although I have fallen in love with 5 Guys Burgers and Fries, South Street will always be my first love and therefore hold a special place.</li><li>The meat is quite dry and does n't have much flavour, but I mainly come for the fries and gravy.</li><li>I can tell that the gravy has been watered down a bit and the fries are a bit too crispy.</li><li>South St. Burger does make burgers better. you do have to pay more to get more though. some of the distinguishing features are: hormone free beef patty- thicker and juicier than McD/Wendys bun choice of white or whole wheat toppings from gourmet ketchup, mustard, mayonaise, cheeses accompanying fries are NY Fries Cost is ~ $ 10 for a regular burger meal ( burger/fries/soft drink) but the taste is more satisfying than McD/Wendys something of this higher caliber class is like Hero Burger The space is well lit, building is a corner unit with variety of seating to suit your fancy, a choice of rounded booths, to conventional tables and bar seating along the windows edge.</li><li>The fries were great after adding salt and ketchup.</li><li>The only thing that was not great were the fries, they were mushy because if the way the container is designed and the lettuce in the salad was turning red ( stale).</li><li>( See picture) The fries were not bad, but HAIR on my ribs is a big NONO !!</li><li>And for some reason the pulled pork pasta had fries and onion rings that I assume they tried I pass off as caramelized onions such a shame ...</li><li>Fries were just mass-produced frozen fries.</li><li>The fries were excellent and the service was great.</li><li>Their fries, onion rings, and soups are really delicious.</li><li>The spicy fries are also worth it, a must try.</li><li>They have fries on their menu board, but do n't actually have fries.</li><li>As always, I love the fries here ....</li><li>I would say yes, it 's significantly less salty and it uses the best fries that is n't done Pomme Frit style.</li><li>I did not check the bag because the Big Fries lying on the top.</li><li>( Wings are getting drier and drier when they used to be saucy, greek rice with dinner was n't cooked properly last time, fries are sometimes stale, etc.)</li><li>The fries are not frozen like so many other places and they were very good.</li><li>I really, really enjoyed the fries but did n't much like the wrap.</li><li>The sauce for the fries was really good and the burger was delicious.</li><li>The over-easy eggs were hard, asked for the fries to be well done and got maybe one crunchy fry with many soggy under-cooked ones.</li><li>Never understood how three eggs and fries could be so messed up.</li><li>I had the lamb burger and sweet potato fries.</li><li>Sadly, the Miller 's fries are outclassed by the Pilot 's, Caplansky 's and the Stockyards, all of which offer comparable burgers at lower prices.</li><li>Crisp univeg accompanies the options, along with a choice of damnable fries, herbed mash or the aforementioned cheesy, steroidal latke.</li><li>The burger burns were pretty thick &amp; the fries were plentiful.</li><li>So yummy and dishes come with a mountain of fries.</li><li>I ordered the three course meal: $ 31 Cesar salad- eh, lack of bold flavours Filet minion- cooked to correct order The fries and beans were ok too.</li><li>Had the following Calamari- Not too greasy, could be a bit crispier but thoroughly enjoyed it with the Cajun dip Tortilla and Dip- Tasty and refills of tortillas was offered by our server Ribs with Fries n Beans- Ribs were prepared quite good, fall off the bone, not too fatty, not too much muscle fibers, sauce was good, fries were crispy, bans were not mush, definitely recommended NY and Top Sirloin Steak was cooked proper to medium rare, for the price it had a decent depth of flavor, salad that came with it was pretty standard, veggies were cooked well, mashed potatoes was good, first time having the Peppercorn sauce not taste like burnt chocolate, bravo to the new kitchen staff Probably will come back but I 'll probably request Miranda as my server as there 's been too many servers that take their job for granted at this location.*** note they do n't validate parking anymore 2apps 3 entrees Above average gratuity Around $ 150 for 3 happy and full people Will come back to this location if I 'm having a craving for tender ribs.</li><li>The fries were seasoned pretty well.</li><li>No dorky menu names like Picklin ' Parish Burger topped with Bayou Dressing and served with a side of Levee fries, Popcorn Shrimp Po' boy, or a Paul Prudhomme Pizza with Blackened Katrina Catfish.</li><li>The fries are good.</li><li>My friends fries were overcooked and borderline burnt and her kafta was very dry.</li><li>Last time, my fries were cold, my daughter 's shawarma was cold, my dad 's order came 10 minutes after the rest of us ... should I go on ?</li><li>Very greasy tho but what do you expect, it is fish and chips after all lol I got the haddock and my boyfriend got the halibut both were good but the fries was a small portion which was disappointing considering how much it came up to.</li><li>The fries are your regular thick cut, kind of soft fish and chip fries.</li><li>I had the halibut and fries and they give you the smallest portion of coleslaw which was tasty and leaving me wanting more.</li><li>The fries seemed to be fresh cut but more importantly did n't pick up any fishiness so either very clean oil or seperate fryer.</li><li>The food was terrific, perfectly battered haggis and black pudding rounds along with well done fries.</li><li>It is the chips ( fries) that really separate this place from the crowd.</li><li>The fries tasted cheap like it came in a bulk package.</li><li>You get a large piece of fish that is not overly battered or greasy with a big portion of delicious fries.</li><li>Batter was right, fries were good and most important, the fish was big.</li><li>The fish is great, but the fries are mehh.</li><li>They really only put one scoop of cheese curds on your small fries- not worth it.</li><li>Person making the fries kept messing up the orders.</li><li>For some reason the fries were dry, the cheese was not fully melted and I think this is because the gravy was lumpy, thick and cold.</li><li>However, I found the fries to be very soggy.</li><li>And for over ten dollars ( with tax) for a simple burger, fries and drink combo, I think they could do a little more than McD 's does: Blot the fries to get rid of extra grease, and maybe offer some additional ground meat choices ( priced accordingly) like turkey and bison burgers.</li><li>The fries are still good the drink I had was pretty watery so that is not worth anything to me.</li><li>I would rather spend a bit more and buy a steak at Loblaw right next door ... forget the fries and drink.</li><li>I found those fresher tasting as long as you forego the seasoning salt ... and you know those fries are pretty decent as well.</li><li>For GF people there is a GF bun avail and the fries are cooked in a separate fryer.</li><li>This comes from my philosophy that burgers and fries are not `` real food''.</li><li>Their fries are New York Fries, meaning it 's not like McDonald 's shoestring.</li><li>The burgers and fries ( although frozen) are delicious and I have never had an issue with anything being over or undercooked.</li><li>I ordered a burger and fries to share.</li><li>The fries were okay; they obviously taste like your regular NYFs.</li><li>The fries were somewhat crispy but the cheese curds did not melt as the gravy was pretty much lukewarm.</li><li>I got the chicken and steak buritto and some extreme fries.</li><li>Although the fries did n't seem super fresh, the buritto was very fresh and flavourful ..</li><li>You have a choice of fries or rice.</li><li>The fries took a bit long to come out but it was worth the wait.</li><li>The Neptune Chicken with hollandaise was disappointung, as it was cooked too much, and the hollandaise was not good, separating and the fries were frozen.</li><li>The lady proprietor is very nice and made sure to give our group plenty of freebies like peanuts, mandarin orange segments, grilled rice cakes, and french fries.</li><li>This McDonalds is a nice place to come for a quick bite to eat and to satisfy your craving for greasy big macs and addictive fries.</li><li>Their onion rings, fries and other flavored fried chicken items are also good.</li><li>Not only my food and fries are always cold, I waited over 10 mins each time in drive thru.</li><li>The fries were of the McCain ridge cut frozen variety but no matter, still tastes crispy and delicious with a dollop of ketchup.</li><li>I liked the burgers and fries a lot but the 1 lbs wings and fries were not worth $ 11.</li><li>Sometimes they can come out a little dry or overdone but the fries are great.</li><li>The angus burger and fries were a steal at $ 5.</li><li>The fries were crispy, almost like a thick, crinkle cut chip.</li><li>The fries were nothing special, but the food was faaaaabulous.</li><li>These include Thai congee, home fries or mango salad.</li><li>If I 'm ever in Toronto again, this California girl is coming back to Katz. there pastrami/ corned beef is good, they stack em pretty high and just a lttle dry, cafeteria like, everything is ala carte, i usually get, a big pastrami sandwich on rye, fries and a piece of the rich chocolate cake, a vernors to wash it all down .... gets busy a lunch, plenty of seating, a bit expensive, last time i went $ 9 bucks a sandwich ( around there) ...</li><li>The fries are n't bad if they 're fresh.</li><li>A great pastrami sandwich on an onion bun and a fries and gravy for the side.</li><li>My mom and I shared a corned beef sandwich, fries and a cabbage roll.</li><li>The fries are just okay, regular fries nothing special.</li><li>The sides are just that sides ... although the French Fries are OK.</li><li>The fries and gravy were very much ordinary, and they have the smallest soda cups I 've ever used.</li><li>The fries that come with it as combo is soggy and plain ( no salt at all).</li><li>The menu consists of shawarmas ( Lamb, chicken, beef), falafel, kebabs ( beef or chicken) in a pita or as a platter with salad, hummus, garlic sauce and rice or fries for the meat options.</li><li>The sauce and paste just makes the fries soggy, and the flavour is just like covering fries in Frank 's ..... stick with the middle eastern appetizers!</li><li>The sauce and paste just makes the fries soggy, and the flavour is just like covering fries in Frank 's ..... stick with the middle eastern appetizers!</li><li>Steak was dry but fries was good.</li><li>My favourite SPICY FRIES were TERRIBLE.</li><li>Party size mixed shawarma plate with large fries is our always favourite, always fresh &amp; great.</li><li>The fries are AMAZING and always fresh!</li><li>Must tries: Babaganoush Hummus Lamb Kebob Shawarma Falafel the BEST fries!</li><li>It also helps that DC is a regular here. solid middle eastern food in scarb. always hits the spot, pretty good fries too.</li><li>The fries are delicious, but often just act as filler, wasting space that could be used for falafel!</li><li>Ordered fries and lentil soup and a Coke to drink.</li><li>The home made fries were burnt and greasy and came at separate times rather than together.</li><li>Fries were also kinda soggy. this spot is a small, quiet, `` hole in the wall'' type of place that I would have never thought to try if I did n't read the yelp reviews.</li><li>My friend ordered `` The Greens ' Egg White Omelette'' On the menu below all the Omelettes it states `` All omelettes served with toast and home fries'' however when the waitress took our order she told us that the omelette my friend ordered did n't get toast and home fries.</li><li>The home fries were n't even cooked enough.</li><li>$ 15 for burger and fries.</li><li>We usually get a lobster ( maybe 1.5 lbs) broiled, salad, fries or roast potato, drink, garlic bread and awesome lobster bisque.</li><li>I may one day come back here just to get a box of poutine, but I am risking emotional melt-down over six dollars worth of fries.</li><li>The meat was tender and moist, the rye bread was fresh, the fries were crispy, and the coleslaw and pickle were just right.</li><li>( Although I have to complement the people they have for doing their best to keep things running smoothly, our server this time was great)- The food portions are a smaller than they used to be, including for items like fries and coleslaw.</li><li>Only got to try this place once but it was awesome Menu looks quite tasty Had to take some time to peruse through Finally had the Calabrese piadina Quite yummy Had a nice kick to it too with the spicy sausage Wanted to try the fries but the piadina was filling enough Would def go back again.</li><li>We split a side order of The truffle fries- could n't really taste the truffle oil, but the rosemary and the shaved grana padano cheese really made for some tasty fries.</li><li>[ Sides ] Tuscan Fries- Only other place where I 've tried fries cooked in truffle oil was at Four Seasons Hotel New York and those are still one of the best fries I 've ever had.</li><li>The fries were more of the same.</li><li>Truffle fries were amazing the first visit but not so great after you 've tried them a couple times.</li><li>The ragu surprisingly went really well with the fries!</li><li>We ordered a whole array of chicken, and fries and before that arrived we had complimentary appetizers.</li><li>We ordered the boneless fried chicken with green onions ( S), fried chicken in spicy sauce ( S), and fries ( Costco like fries!).</li><li>Then again, I 'm not sure of another place that has garlic butter fries but their regular fries are just as good too.</li><li>Garlic butter fries were n't my thing- they had a good texture ( crispy outside), but they had a sweet taste which was weird.</li><li>On the positive, the actual hamburgers were much fresher than I 've experienced living abroad, so yes the burgers were much better and fries were of the normal quality ( not too salty actually).</li><li>We ordered 2 large size sets ( on another note, my god they are big!) and they gave us a small fries with large drinks ... not a huge deal, but just the principle that if you pay extra for something you should get what you pay for.</li><li>The fries are yummy and next door there is a bakery which had very good Cakes and Pastries.</li><li>As the owner or even manager he undoubtedly knows the menu says all sandwiches come with fries, roasted potatoes or rice, which I pointed out to him.</li><li>Worst fries ever.</li><li>The food is affordable and is made to order, no stale fries here.</li><li>I ordered the sandwich with sweet potato fries.</li><li>The chicken, biscuit and fries was fresh.</li><li>Their fries are always tasty, has a perfect crispiness to them.</li><li>These are seriously the best fries I 've had in a long time.</li><li>The burgers and fries are quite good, by fast food standards.</li><li>You sha n't regret it. having heard that this was the original st.louis, and i love st. louis, i thought this place was going to be amazing. i got the weekend special which came with wings, fries, jalepeno poppers and chicken strips.</li><li>Slightly saucy and the fries are great.</li><li>The fries are more like British chips which was awesome too.</li><li>I really enjoyed the fries tough.</li><li>Very cozy and comfy. ordered their Wednesday special- 1/3 rack of ribs and chicken wings for $ 14. fries were good- you can actually taste the potato: P chicken wings were absolutely amazing. highly recommend chicken wings!</li><li>They changed the fries.</li><li>Fries are always amazing.</li><li>Oh and mine came with french fries- normally I 'm not a huge fan of fries, I find them kind of soggy in dinners, but these were amazing.</li><li>We were in the area, and stopped here for breakfast on sat morning. the egg benny is good, not super awesome but good. home fries- again, pretty average. hubby had the burger patty with some beans all around the egg and cheese. it was interesting. did n't taste like much and i was wondering why would n't they serve it with some toast at least ?</li><li>Be warned that the burger and especially fries will be mysteriously extra soggy if you ask for takeout, so take the time to enjoy your burger right away!</li><li>Fries may be a bit peppery for little ones, but otherwise a great new gem in the neighborhood.</li><li>So for about 8.00, it was n't bad and it was served with freshly cooked fries.</li><li>Portion on the fries could have been bigger and I would have preferred the steak to have 2 pieces of bread and not open faced, but still really liked it.</li><li>By the Numbers Length of Stay: 4 hours ( 6:30pm-10:30pm)

four small pieces of white meat and a lot of fries piping hot ( the fries that is, not the chicken).</li><li>On the positive side, the Korean BBQ beef coleslaw sandwich and fries were really delicious ... i did n't even need to use their special garlic dill dip but i recommend ordering the dip with your fries to have a fresh change from ketchup sometimes. today 's soup was beef barley which was average as was the double amaretto sour however i was pleased they offered fresh options and could accommodate my off-menu drink request. final tip- do not order the nachos here. they were pretty bad ... happy i can always get great nachos at my joint fox n fiddle finch. hope the manager can fix the crappy service here because I 'd like to come back to watch a game and taste the fajita tacos, fish tacos or one of their tempting burgers. ok last last tip i dont know if i should write this but the servers are pretty so i guess that could be a plus for those who appreciate that sort of thing.</li><li>On the positive side, the Korean BBQ beef coleslaw sandwich and fries were really delicious ... i did n't even need to use their special garlic dill dip but i recommend ordering the dip

and corner kicks only to belch in time for the German win! 3 stars for the quality of chicken, hard and chewy and cold fries.</li><li>When it came she had a little tiny cup of slaw and the fries.</li><li>She realized it and I said no problem, I will just throw myself on the those fries.</li><li>The fries which I should n't be eating were the best part, the slaw was not good.</li><li>She ended up having the fries topped off for my husband.</li><li>My fries were nice and crispy though, I enjoyed those thoroughly!</li><li>I think I ordered the something with fries, not that i care to remember.</li><li>He had a chicken Caesar salad and sweet potato fries.</li><li>I love the breaded fries which reminded me of good old BK fries!</li><li>I love the breaded fries which reminded me of good old BK fries!</li><li>Ordered: Coffee, Ice Water, Coke, Bacon &amp; Eggs, Ceasar Salad, Grilled Cheese with Ham, Fries with Gravy The coffee was disgusting, water did not come with any Ice ( even though I specifically asked), but the Coke came with a glass full of ice, go figure ?</li><li>Although the fries and gravy were to my satisfaction, the Eggs &amp; Grilled Cheese had oil dripping from it!</li><li>Your burger and fries are served up quicker than Harvey 's can slide one out.</li><li>The fries were a bit of a let down.</li><li>Fries were amazing.</li><li>This location unlike some of the other ones, does not offer pasta, pizza, French fries or have a hot table or have the mini sandwiches.</li><li>Add some soggy fries, sauce with the consistency of jelly, and a stale bun, and welcome to the chicken place.</li><li>The fries are tasteless, the wedges are OK nothing special, the honey garlic wings were absolutely terrible.</li><li>Their sandwiches and fries are great.</li><li>The fire grilled chicken ranges from very good, to occasionally overcooked and too dry, the fries are cheap 1/4 `` frozen fries usually over-fried and over-salted, but baked potatoes are excellent, and if you order the'' Tuesday Special `` you get a whole chicken, rolls, fries/baked or rice, and sauce for $ 18 + tax and a $ 2 delivery charge, so one really ca n't complain.</li><li>I always get the chicken place sandwich with spicy fries, the price is not bad either.</li><li>The wedges and spicy fries are yummy and plentiful.</li><li>I tried their Tuesday special ( $ 18 + tax)- whole chicken, large fries, 4 dinner rolls, sauce.</li><li>The fries are thick cut, which I like.</li><li>Two whole flame roasted chickens, two salads, fries, bread rolls and gravy ... better flavour than the supermarket chickens ... and no where near as salty as that ski cabin place.</li><li>We order greek salads, which are good, as well as the spicy fries which are definitely frozen and completely delicious- I 've got a soft spot for frozen potatoes.</li><li>The fries were a miss today.</li><li>Additionally, I think they re-fried my batch because I asked for the fries to be well done.</li><li>The fries definitely tasted heavy with oil.</li><li>Next time, I 'm going to order `` fries well done, as a new batch- not refried, please.''.</li><li>Their fries are good and it tastes like they use Renee 's caesar dressing on it.</li><li>The burger patty and fries were soft and moist.</li><li>I 've experienced things like dry patties, overcooked dry fries, stale-tasting buns and other ingredients.</li><li>Their fries and poutine are very good as well.</li><li>More like plastic, fries were mushy ..</li><li>The fries were mushy and not thoroughly cooked as well.</li><li>I always order the turkey burger and the fries are decent.</li><li>Deep fried frozen fries, a bit meh but it 's deep fried so whatever.</li><li>Their pizzas are great, good topping choice, especially the zucchini slices, their fries are amazing.</li><li>The onion rings were delicious and crispy, but frozen ( as were the fries, they came out of a bag).</li><li>Not bad for burger and fries.</li><li>The fries were OK, again they felt very generic.</li><li>The fries were a little mushy on the inside for my taste- but still not bad.</li><li>Good:- Our server was attentive and pleasant, great job- Salad was reasonably fresh- Fries were pretty good Okay:- Wings were passable, certainly not `` best in the city'' as stated on the menu Bad:- Ribs ... like other reviews noted I 'm pretty sure they 're boiled, not smoked ... perhaps thrown into some sort of smoker briefly after they 're cooked but certainly not smoked over a long period of time, which is disappointing for a place with `` smoke house'' in its name- The chicken was dry and had very little taste, also not at all `` smoked'' like it says on the menu- The `` pulled pork'' was just ... wrong.</li><li>The platter was about 35 $ and came with wings, ribs, shortribs, pulled pork, fries, cornbread, baked beans and coleslaw.</li><li>But the fries were good.</li><li>Beer makes me happy. this was ok --- SUMMARY --- Plus 's: good place to hang out, decent food, Minus 's: sitting on the patio means breathing all the car exhaust from the cars on Yonge street --- MORE DETAILS --- we choose a platter for two ... it consisted of: very tender chicken ( i picked it up and a piece of meat fell off- SO TENDER) first time i had cornbread- it looked burnt on the bottom, so i just ate the top part not bad ( it would n't ' be my first choice) pulled pork was ok chicken wings were fairly good beef brisket was pretty good .. ribs were kinda dry ... in the end everything kinda tasted the same. fries were good- not too salty. stepping in, the restaurant itself is nice, there are booths or table seating indoors. the main window is a garage front that opens into the patio area facing yonge st. interior has exposed beam ceilings and there 's many nostalgic memorabilia decorated throughout. we ordered a couple of things from the menu 1. spaghetti with beef brisket- yeah i know an experimental dish but i was feeling like spaghetti and if the brisket was good -- you know that would been amazing. unfortunately the brisket was covered in tomato sauce so I could n't taste it in it 's full glory or not ..</li><li>Fries were the only strong suit.</li><li>The fries should not be the highlight of the meal but at this place, they were.</li><li>Their fries and dill sauce are the star of the show, even though the wings are very descent too!</li><li>The fries however, were to die for, especially with the dill sauce.</li><li>St Louis really wins me with their fries.</li><li>Fries were good.</li><li>Stick with the wings and fries.</li><li>The best part were the fries.</li><li>Fries are optional on the additional orders.</li><li>They definitely added some awesome seasoning to the fries because these are probably the best fries I 've ever had.</li><li>Fries were pretty good though.</li><li>I specifically asked to have the fries separated and they said they could do that.</li><li>I asked if the fries were separated and they said YES.</li><li>I leave the place furious only to find out that my fries are not separate.</li><li>I should say that the chicken wings, fries or no fries daily special is nothing to sniff at!</li><li>The fries are AMAZING and the wings are decent sized and taste quite good.</li><li>I ordered a pound of BBQ-Medium wings with fries and my wife ordered sweet potato fries.</li><li>Food here is the same as other bars: fries, poutine, burgers and wings.</li><li>Otherwise if you come for the wings which I assume you would, you 're in luck bevause the wings and fries are always good.</li><li>Fries- These fries are AMAZING I love them.</li><li>St. Louis has the yummiest fries, so crispy and tasty, perfect when paired with their signature dill dip.</li><li>For the price its fair trade, but the burger was dry, the fries were greasy, but a big portion.</li><li>The chicken fingers were fine ( those are pretty hard to mess up), the fries were awful, and not even salted.</li><li>The burger and fries were okay.</li><li>I 've had the burgers, fries, onion rings, burgers and wings before and they were all really good.</li><li>If

soft or crunchy, just done right.</li><li>The home fries were delicious and everything was made with tons of love.</li><li>$ 10 for 3 eggs, bacon, home fries, toast and coffee.</li><li>The home fries
