<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 2643' %><h2>white salad dressing<br />occurrence: 1</h2><div><ol><li>I like the fried zucchini the most, the kimchi has a spicy-sweetness with a bit of sour, and the broccoli with the white salad dressing was the best. unfortunately the main was not as good anymore. the kalbijim was not tender at all, and there is n't any potato or radish with the stew. while sweet and sour pork tasted ok, but the sauce was a bit thick, and the batter too. the worst was the Kimchi fried rice, the potion was really small, almost no Kimchi in it, and it taste really sour, not in a good way. and the fried rice was n't hot, not spicy hot and not temperature hot, yet it just came out of the kitchen less than 5 minutes after we order it.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
