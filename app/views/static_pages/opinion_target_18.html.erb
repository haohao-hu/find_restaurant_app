<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 18' %><h2>meal<br />occurrence: 378</h2><div><ol><li>Every other day, for nearly 6 years, I walked by Cuisine of India and never really paid it much attention until people who lived no where nearby started recommending it. then i began to notice that lux cars were always parked there; it 's one of the only places around this subway travellers ' strip with a parking lot in front of the restaurant. and, as far as I can tell, it 's free to park. but certainly there 's more than the parking that caused these commuters from other parts of the city to rave about Cuisine of India. driving is one thing, but in this weather, i wondered,' is it worth walking ? ' so, i rallied my girlfriends living nearby to see just why commuters from other parts of the city were flocking. we got the impression that few local residents ever visited, since the host quizically looked at us ( the group of asian girls) when we entered and waited to be seated. after establishing that, indeed, we were there to eat, yes, food from Cuisine of India, the service was attentive, patient, and warm. the a la carte portions at Cuisine of India are small, and yet incredibly rich. so you can sample a few and be full, without getting a food baby. unfortunately, i do n't remember the names of the dishes we tried, but i recall that the curried cauliflower dish was very well-spiced, without being spicy. the naan are excellent, as are the spicy cracker-like flatbreads. the latter are served while you wait for your meal and the heat really does hit after a few nibbles, so pace yourself as you wait for your meal.</li><li>Mt girlfriends family has made a tradition of going here every year for dinner on New Years Day ( why we keep going when one of the kids got their meal AFTER everyone else ate last year) Anyways, I tried a few things on the menu until I came across the souvlaki ( the meat, veg and rice was nothing special, but wow did I ever fall in love with the dressing on the Greek salad).</li><li>Would recommend going there for a very satisfying 15 $/ person meal!</li><li>Plenty of free apps with your meal and we always leave with enough food for another meal.</li><li>You know how you have a sense that the waitstaffs really attentive, really care about you and make sure you have a good meal ?</li><li>You can get a meal and add the salad bar buffet for a small fee, or you can get the salad bar as a full meal.</li><li>A balanced meal this is not, but next time I want something cheap in the neighbourhood that is n't a pizza or corned beef, I 'll check this place out again.</li><li>Following that rule this meal would have earned the waitress a whopping $ 3.50 but I found myself asking `` where the hell is our waitress'' so often that there was no tip left to leave.</li><li>Inside the meal was n't too piping hot, the cheese was melting though.</li><li>As Vanessa mentioned in her previous review, the salads, which to be fair most restaurants in the area add up to the meal, are grandiose.</li><li>If I were to make a list of places to go for a meal, Marky 's would be near the very bottom.</li><li>3 of their salmon sashimi = 1 salmon sashimi anywhere else. all the fish were so thin it looked like oil soaked through a piece of paper. the whole meal is smaller than the size of my fist ... and over half of it was white radish used to fill and prop up the transparent fish. after you calculate everything .. you totally lose.</li><li>We had a delicious meal here- unfortunately the server was n't very quick to greet us and our food sat on top of the sushi bar waiting to come to us for a long long time.</li><li>Everything tasted good and the meal was filling.</li><li>Once I did get greeted, and I ordered and the food came out pretty promptly, but near the end of my meal, I wanted to order another drink but again, it was at least 10 minutes before the server came back ( and at that point, a gentlemen they 'd seated next to me had been waiting that same 10 minutes to be greeted by a server) so I gave up and asked for the bill.</li><li>The service was on point and we had a very enjoyable meal.</li><li>Delicious meal every time.</li><li>If you want a good meal, do n't go there.</li><li>They were so kind as to give me a big whopping $ 25 after a ruined meal for three.</li><li>So I gave it to a homeless person and told them to go enjoy a good meal.</li><li>For the most part, the meal is nothing special now.</li><li>Not a great place for big gatherings, but perfect to share an intimate meal.</li><li>It was delicious, but was nearly a meal in and of itself.</li><li>The meal for the two of us came to about $ 58 plus tax.</li><li>There was one other couple in our room who talked our ears off through the entire meal about how awesome this place is.</li><li>Oh, and the freshly-baked bread is downright dangerous to the appetite you 'll need ... so be careful ... but if you ask for a doggie-bag ( not for your Pug or Rottweiler but for yourself) they make a little basket out of tin foil so you can take your leftover meal home.</li><li>It was a very filling meal and pretty reasonably priced as I got a salad and some bread to go with it.</li><li>Looking for a quick delicious meal ?</li><li>As I sit in the restaurant at the end of a bad meal, I normally might describe it as having left a bad taste in my mouth.</li><li>This meal was the definition of bland.</li><li>The best meal on the menu, Veal Marsala, is now gone.</li><li>The homemade pita was probably the best part of our meal, the wine was great too.</li><li>Even at it 's busiest, the noise level never really reaches above a murmer, so it 's also a great place for a no fuss, quiet meal.</li><li>I think the cooks need more training and knowledge on how to cook a decent meal.</li><li>There is also a patio and a McDonald 's right across if you want a cheap meal right after these amazing drink prices!</li><li>Prior to eating the soup I was feeling run down and tired but this soup actually gave me a big burst of energy, this would be a great meal for anyone who was feeling a little under the weather.</li><li>During my meal I was asked how my meal was and on two different occasions she asked if I wanted more side dishes.</li><li>Children ca n't finish a meal on their own.</li><li>Enjoyed this authentic korean meal!</li><li>Including the 3 pops ordered, the meal came up to approx.</li><li>Low and behold, my meal was very good, with a very short wait time as well.</li><li>Mid way through our meal, the restaurant was full house and it got super busy.</li><li>But today it was cold, and my boyfriends meal was a tad cold as well.</li><li>People will finish their meal and leave their table and the staff will either: a) ignore the abandoned table that needs to be bussed for far too long or b) they 'll buss the table and let the clean empty table just sit there empty while ignoring people waiting to be sat because they prefer to seat in the order you arrive.</li><li>Let 's not get me started on the missing Tortilla, but even with it this meal can be considered good value for the price due to the amount of Food provided.</li><li>Here in town with some friends and after waiting for a crazy long time ( when there were tables open. why ?) we finally got sat and had a good meal.</li><li>Overall, a good place to stop by and grab a late night meal!</li><li>You can either get your meal or eat family style.</li><li>When the meal was done, we stopped ordering, there was no one there to clear our plates and basically sat there for a good 30 mins getting cold and gross.</li><li>The entire meal was satisfying, tasty and fresh.</li><li>I did n't get the feeling that my meal was sitting under a heat lamp of any sort.</li><li>There is so much flavour in that one meal.</li><li>Their menu has an array of choices ( from their classic chicken balls to their noodle dishes) and every meal has been delicious so far!</li><li>For us its a dependable, inexpensive meal when we are running late.</li><li>By the end of our meal, I enjoy the food at this place but that chicken just tastes awful.</li><li>Overall, I had a pleasant meal and the food is good.</li><li>Perfect treat shared amongst friends after a hearty meal.</li><li>Honestly, it 's a great place to go and have a lovely meal.</li><li>It 's just a decent place to get a meal.</li><li>Recommended for hungry carnivores looking for a simple satisfying meal that is also cost-friendly.</li><li>Review: The service was a bit slow considering their price for a meal but the food was good.</li><li>Great atmosphere, great food, good service ( service level dropped a little bit through out our meal), and prices are not bad for what you get !!</li><li>Food quality was great, we ordered the filet mignon and New York steaks for our meal and they were cooked excellently and quite delicious.</li><li>Allows for conversation without loud music dominating, and so made for a nice intimate meal.</li><li>Cranberry was the only decent thing on that plate, but still I regretted the entire meal.</li><li>The meal included a choice of soup or Caesar salad.</li><li>First of all, the entire meal was cold.</li><li>We decided to go somewhere else for coffee and dessert since our meal had been so underwhelming.</li><li>Non-alcoholic beverages are also an option if you do n't want to be caught drinking before 11AM;) For those who ca n't stomach such a grandiose meal in the morning, you can always go the à la carte route.</li><li>Service was very slow- the meal took two and half hours and our bus boy needed to yell at our server multiple times to get our check.</li><li>This was possibly the worst meal we have ever had.</li><li>Downside to the meal: was first time the seafood pasta was amazing.</li><li>The meal came with an alcoholic drink, bread basket, entrée, and dessert.</li><li>For $ 30 and 15% off, the multiple course meal with alcoholic drink is a pretty good deal.</li><li>All in all a nice meal.</li><li>Overall decent meal!</li><li>No idea how they make anything, but it 's an incredibly filling meal ( enough for 2 people to share if you 're not starving that day)- comes with a salad, lots of rice, and deliciously baked/grilled potatoes.</li><li>Worst meal I 've had for a while.</li><li>I wanted a healthy salad and got a flavorless meal I could make better at home.</li><li>The meal costed $ 40 for 2 people with lots of leftovers for the next day.</li><li>It comes with salad and miso soup as appetizers, and a scoop of ice cream to end the meal ( I am not sure if they offer ice cream to everyone or just a big group).</li><li>You ge two large pieces of chicken kabob and although the meat portion is pretty large I found myself still not fully satisfied in terms of the fullness of my belly;) I got my meal to go and had to wait a little less than 10 minutes.</li><li>They forgot to get my basket of bread, I had to ask for it and they added some complimentary hummus and hot sauce ( which is the only reason this review gets two stars) No one bothered to check on us if we were having a good meal nor did anyone bother to fill our water.</li><li>The turnips that they gave her tasted like melted plastic ( actually melted plastic) and her meal was n't even hot either.</li><li>This place offers daily deals so it 's good on the wallet when you need a filling meal, but short on cash.</li><li>They lady gave us a York Peppermint Patty at the end of our meal which was a perfect ending.</li><li>We continued to eat the dissatisfied meal, where the lady did n't even bother to ask if we wanted a refill on our drinks, which we clearly needed since our glass was empty!</li><li>Waitress was all over the table throughout the meal- literally reaching across and handing dishes to those seated on the other side, obviously untrained.</li><li>The shop looks like nothing from the outside but the halibut with chips are simply amazing. i have n't gotten a chance to eat anything else here, since all i ever get is fish and chips. pretty heavy meal, bring an empty stomach and expect to be stuffed! if you been to Olde Yorke Fish n Chips, this is on par or better since the Olde Yorke `` waterdown'' their fish nowadays.</li><li>It 's about 14 $ for that meal, kind of pricey, but the value is there.</li><li>You come here to have a good meal and leave.</li><li>At least you can use their sauce to make things taste better .. here you have nothing to help you save your meal.</li><li>Came to Tutto Pronto with my family as it has become a tradition ever since my sister and I got full-time jobs to treat my parents out to a nice meal.</li><li>Everybody enjoyed their meal and my dad was still talking about it when he got home.</li><li>Our meal started off with a couple glasses of wine, obviously, and a few appetizers.</li><li>My meal of Penna alla Pollo was terrific!</li><li>The first time I walked in I think I was the only non-Filipino there, and the staff welcomed me and immediately gave me a crash course in Filipino cuisine- the meal was incredible.</li><li>We did n't order much because we were about to head to a Yelp event with food but the three dishes ended up being plenty as an entire meal for 5ppl!</li><li>While the food was very fresh and tasty, the lack of sauce made the meal a tad dry.</li><li>This is my go-to spot on campus to grab a healthy, wholesome meal.</li><li>The sandwiches are so big, half of one is a meal in itself!</li><li>Pho is excellent for hang overs and a great meal when your sick.</li><li>For example, the plate of bean sprouts, lime and other herbs that accompany your meal are fresh and generous.</li><li>Eat a lot of pho with my buddies and this place was the recommended spot if wiling to make the drive ( close to my fiancée 's house) I love the thicker noodles as compared to other places and even though my well done beef is NEVER well done I still love this place because that seems to be the norm I usually get well done beef with beef balls and always enjoy the meal despite the mountain of fat that ends up beside my bowl A place to try if you have not already.</li><li>Better than grabbing a fast food chain meal Definitely a repeat place especially when craving something to warm the tummy at 10pm.</li><li>Halfway through our meal we saw something move on the table and we realized that it was a cockroach.</li><li>Highlights of the meal: Sexy summer roll- Very light and refreshing with a bit of a kick.</li><li>My boyfriend tried to compliment the service when he paid for our meal but she did n't seem to understand.</li><li>Service was subpar with regards to ordering our meal.</li><li>My meal and my friend 's meal each cost $ 7.25.</li><li>The entire meal was fantastic, from the olives and fish pate opener to the main course closer.</li><li>None of us had visited here before, but it looked like a promising option for a good meal.</li><li>You have an option of 1 bottle of Soju, or 5 bottles of beer, along with your meal.</li><li>It was a very fullfilling meal.</li><li>This place has it and it comes out scorching hot, by the end of my meal it was still warm to the touch.</li><li>Be sure to try Hite, a Korean beer, with your meal.</li><li>I sincerely suggest anyone who 's searching for a comfy place for an enjoyable meal to avoid this.</li><li>Apart from the Mariscos al Guajillo ( tiger shrimp, basa fish and Atlantic lobster sauteed with onions, guajillo peppers and salsa verde for $ 22) which was EXCELLENT, the rest of the meal was just ok.</li><li>It is easy to create a balanced, filling meal that is not too unhealthy.</li><li>Had a very nice meal here.</li><li>The meal special comes with a tomato soup or cream soup and a dinner roll, also coffee or tea.</li><li>Not sure if they 've changed kitchen staff over the years ( since it 's the same owners, I did recognize one of the ladies who took customers ' orders), but the meal was just pretty disappointing.</li><li>If you order from the regular menu and want to have a milk tea with your meal like I do, you 're looking at upwards of $ 15 or more per person which is pretty high for HK style cafes.</li><li>I could n't even finish my entire meal!</li><li>The meal at the end was well balanced and I was satisfied at the end.</li><li>Still a solid, cheap meal, even without the salad.)</li><li>But to enjoy your meal, you ca n't eat there because they have no tables.</li><li>I used to work relatively close to this restaurant and would come here often with friends after work to have a nice relaxing meal and a catch-up.</li><li>Side dishes: lettuce, bean sprouts, kimchii, sweet radish, kimchii flavored radish and peanuts with little dried fish The meal was good but nothing really stood out for me.</li><li>We ordered the set meal ( originally meant for 4 people) and an order of pork bone soup.</li><li>I craved for more veggies in the noodle soup but honestly it was quite a perfect meal and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.</li><li>In fact, it really may be my first time having a meal around Jane and Steeles, but I ended up here nonetheless.</li><li>The only thing good about this meal was their complimentary bread/focaccias, but I 'm not going through that again just for bread.</li><li>The meal is also very big, you could share with another person!</li><li>It would be difficult to find such a good meal for a similar price.</li><li>The meal was 11 Canadian dollars but was still charged 11 US dollars dispite me explaining to them that the US dollar was stronger than the Canadian dollar.</li><li>Overall, it was a good meal but I do n't think I 'd go back as I usually stick to the smaller type thai restaurants.</li><li>Note: if you 're looking for a ' good deal meal', try Kinnaree Thai Restaurant, my personal second fave next to this one.</li><li>They both came pretty SMALL for meal size lol.</li><li>Our server was polite and helpful, although towards the end of our meal, her service levels fell ( empty water glasses, long wait for dessert menu and orders).</li><li>The thai pumpkin soup that I got was too salty and the remainder of the meal was too bland.</li><li>Summerlicious Lunch of 2015 For $ 18 ( before tax and tip), you get a 3 course meal with an app, main dish, and dessert.</li><li>Over all: a horrid, nasty, poor quality and expensive meal.</li><li>The meal went great with Thai Iced Tea which tasted authentic.</li><li>It was a very enjoyable meal and despite the steeper prices, I would definitely come back to eat the curry beef again.</li><li>Saving graces of the meal to be honest!</li><li>Overall the meal was disappointing and not cheap.</li><li>While I enjoyed my meal- particularly the battered beef in my curry- I do n't think I would return to Linda again.</li><li>If you 're looking for an inexpensive, tasty and filling meal, check this place out.</li><li>Pro tip: do not try to order your meal/ converse with the server in Vietnamese.</li><li>It was only when we ended our meal and had a look at the outdoor restaurant banner and noticed the `` Vietnamese and Chinese Cuisine'' header under the restaurant name, which is fine and makes sense.</li><li>Overall the meal was not the best and it was rather expensive for a sandwich, a side, and a drink.</li><li>Came here after a workout with a few friends, looking for a quick and filling meal to replenish our resources.</li><li>OK let me explain ... nowhere in the city are you going to get a meal for $ 3.00, but here you can ... the issues are they often do not have food.</li><li>Excellent meal.</li><li>Ordered Lamb soup with a hearty meal best cure for the flu !!</li><li>And since we like Levantine food, we can appreciate a good meal of hummus, ful, falafel, and eggplant.</li><li>I do n't know anywhere in Toronto where you can eat like a king for 6-8 people, enjoy your meal so heartily, and still come out with a bill around 60-80 dollars.</li><li>The highlight of the entire meal was the salad which was refreshing and helped balance the strong musky flavour of the lamb.</li><li>Solid meal.</li><li>If you have 2 for 1 meal coupon, your meal with a drink will cost about $ 10 which is pretty good considering that 's what you 'd end up paying even at fast food places.</li><li>Not `` I care if you have a good meal'' service.</li><li>Which is fine for a $ 50 or less meal.</li><li>One thing I found out is if you want a candle for your butter you have to ask or they will bring it in a little cup ( if your a seafood fan you want the piping hot butter) My meal comes my crab is cut into small pieces witch I am not a fan of Prefer the whole legs ( personal preference) they were cooked perfect.</li><li>The meal came with garlic bread ( Delicious but very buttery!), potato or fries or salad.</li><li>This should have prepared us for the meal we were about to receive.</li><li>Other food: Your meal starts with a free basket of garlic bread.</li><li>I remember paying less for the meal I got last time &amp; getting 2 pieces of naan instead of 1.</li><li>The roti shell was very soft and the beans did not dry out the meal ( like some other places).</li><li>Decent quick meal in a clean environment.</li><li>I 've been to this location many times over the years, and have always had an enjoyable meal.</li><li>Great place to go for a meal, especially for big groups and families, though also works well for singles and couples.</li><li>Honestly, if she just apologized and offered to remake the food and give us better discount, i would write a better review .. if they gave us a free meal, i would definitely come back.</li><li>It was a nice meal coming off a long enough flight and was definitely a comfort food.</li><li>Considering reviewing congee queen is like reviewing Asian Mcdonalds, I immediately said no. However, after coming home after our big meal and thinking about this, I realized that I need to be a better person and ensure that those who stalk me feel rewarded with an easter egg, I shall now write this one out for JT and RS.</li><li>It 's hard not to enjoy a meal when the restaurant makes room for a large lovable group;).</li><li>Dishes will arrive sporadically and often you 'll be almost done your meal before your last dish arrives.</li><li>Second when we were almost in the beginning of our meal, they asked us to leave because they had to close.</li><li>The staff are friendly and the prices are fair ( $ 10/person will get you a good meal).</li><li>Honestly, I am surprised by the amazing ratings here, because my meal tonight was not good.</li><li>In fact, the entire meal was great, I 'd get the lobster again in a heartbeat.</li><li>Park here, and after your meal you can waddle off the food in the Shops at Don Mills.</li><li>Each meal ordered there was a main course + a special drink + dessert.</li><li>Midnight dinner for eight ... and the staff was so helpful in helping us figure out the perfect bubble tea to match our meal.</li><li>I enjoyed the King 's Tea Pork Ribs Noodle meal combo which I upgraded to a hibiscus bubble tea ( it comes with plain green tea).</li><li>You can get $ 3 off when you buy a meal and a drink at the same time.</li><li>For the weekend dinner, the meal also comes with some `` extras'' which are not all you can eat, last time I got a skewer of shrimp and scallops, and fried shrimp ( torpedo style).</li><li>As typical for Korean restaurants, they serve a number of side dishes along with your meal, which you can ask to be refilled at any time.</li><li>The meal is okay.</li><li>Thanks for the meal but wo n't be coming back though!</li><li>The price was pretty high considering I ordered a basic meal however.</li><li>The meal overall though was still very good.</li><li>The standard 4 set banchan arrived with the meal and I liked that they served their barley tea warm and not scolding hot.</li><li>Refuses to serve them until you get your meal and are reluctant to give you seconds.</li><li>The chicken was nothing special, though the cheese did help the 2-portion meal be a bit more filling.</li><li>Overall, it was a tasty and satisfying meal!</li><li>It 's still a good filling tasty meal, but I have to knock off a star because I had it from them before they started bringing it out fully cooked.</li><li>You can also order sauces from a list to go with your meal.</li><li>Some surprising positives, they give you cold lemon tea with your meal which hits the spot for this kind of meal.</li><li>Some surprising positives, they give you cold lemon tea with your meal which hits the spot for this kind of meal.</li><li>They also include a bit of dessert with your meal which is a nice touch.</li><li>Hunger gone, well balanced meal and it tasted pretty great!</li><li>Please bring cash or your bank card ... if not your date might have to even pay for your meal ...</li><li>The chefs definitely piled on my veggies very generously and even after sharing my meal, I was very full!</li><li>A great value for a good meal.</li><li>Came here with a friend to grab a quick casual meal.</li><li>Very small restaurant good for a quick meal for maybe 2-4 people max.</li><li>Now I know why the girls who were sitting next to my group did n't finish their meal.</li><li>The only other advice I can give, is not to feel the need to eat everything on your plate, or else you 'll eat up falling asleep after your meal ..</li><li>We had a really nice meal and the service was pretty good since one server sticked to us the entire time.</li><li>Ariel G. may want to take that trip down memory lane, but this meal was a memory I 'd rather repress.</li><li>You order your meal as soon as you walk in the door, which for someone as indecisive as me, is a difficult thing.</li><li>We had a delicious meal, the concept is refreshing, and the service was great.</li><li>To be fair he warmed up a little bit more throughout our meal but not by much.</li><li>But this mixture of methods, changing it seems during the meal, is annoying as well as leads to long delays and confusion between customers and staff.</li><li>You order when you first step in- then you move all the way down the way to pay for your meal- they give you a card and then you sit down wherever you want and then they bring you your meal.</li><li>And we were ready for a nice sit-down meal.</li><li>Great food with socially-conscious management, super stylish, more of a quick, filling meal than the typical sit-down.</li><li>Cavolo ( $ 5 as a side) The highlight of our meal was the insalate!</li><li>If you 're looking for value or a good meal, there are so many more restaurants along Yonge to choose from other than here.</li><li>Domestic beers are cheap if you feel like having one with your meal.</li><li>A cheap and cheerful meal though Chowon on Drewry Ave. has a slight edge on quality.</li><li>A fun place to grab some super-casual meal with friends, but somewhat tight seating and average quality.</li><li>It 's a meal for two with lots of meat, lettuce, soon tofu soup, and rice.</li><li>I wish there was more ribs but the meal was pretty filling for 2 people.</li><li>This meal is def enough for 2 people and at a very reasonable price ( $ 45).</li><li>You get a slice of watermelon each after you 're done your meal because to help cut the MSG that they put into the soup so you wo n't get thirsty later on.</li><li>My friend asked for a refill of side dishes, but the waiter said they can only refill 3 types for the entire meal even though competing nearby Korean restaurants refill all of them.</li><li>I went on a week night, and at the start of the evening only one server was taking care of all the tables ( but I was there VERY early, like 4:30pm), but towards the end of our meal a couple more staff were there to help.</li><li>Picking just a basket of fried chicken, regardless of small or large, will have you starting your meal with a sizzling foil-lined cast iron skillet of corn.</li><li>The meal comes with complementary 3 flavour vegetables, along with sizzling cream corn.</li><li>Take out is the way to go really if you want anything resembling a complete meal ( i.e.</li><li>They always load up my pita with everything I like and it makes for a great little meal with lots of veggie options and various sauces.</li><li>The key to enjoying your meal at this restaurant is to recognize it for what it is.</li><li>We also both got a shake to go with our meal and they were really good too.</li><li>We were given plenty of time to chat and sip our drinks after the blissful meal.</li><li>Midway through my meal, my neighbour on my other side ordered some drink with a heart made of chocolate sprinkles/flakes on top!</li><li>Very Cheap meal considering a bowl that will fill you up to your hearts content from 5-7 $.</li><li>But anyways, I enjoyed the meal, did not however enjoy the etiquette by the employee.</li><li>A quality meal for its price point especially on a cold day, or if you 're feeling kind of sick.</li><li>- What a horrible meal ..</li><li>Called the Epic meal now.</li><li>Personally, if I were to go for an actual meal, I would recommend it as a good place for brunch.</li><li>You arrive and a card is given to you ... you approach a food station with a plate, gesturing for your selection like Oliver Twist .. the Food Barista will punch your card with the appropriate value of the meal hidden in `` code'' At the end of your meal, your `` code'' is calculated and you then pay $ $ $.</li><li>Was n't really a good value for money ... for this price, go down the street to Aoyama and have a way better meal!</li><li>The bill surprised me since the `` original'' price of the meal would have been 60ish.</li><li>Overall, our meal was really meh.</li><li>Also with every meal you order comes with miso soup, salad and green tea ice cream for dessert ( almost every meal).</li><li>Have literally just finished my meal ( lunch).</li><li>If you know what LA kalbi is, you will know that 5 measly pieces of bone left at the end of the meal is hardly worth the whopping price tag of $ 18.99.</li><li>They never check up on your table, and it takes over 30 minutes to get your meal if they bother bringing it to you.</li><li>If you 're looking for a place you can have a quick buffet meal, think of another place ... insulting me by making me wait to be seating in an empty restaurant is not usually what a buffet restaurant wants to happen ... usually be seated, served and leave is the way so they can turn over and seat more people.</li><li>All in all, we ate less than half of our meal- only the cuts of fish that actually looked like normal, fresh fish.</li><li>The best schwarma ever Must try the chicken on the rocks Reasonable prices Very friendly staff The best option for students at York University looking for a good meal.</li><li>I might return for the free meal ( only).</li><li>Weekend mornings are busy, between the special and the fact that a family can go somewhere comfy and get a no-fuss meal in between shopping stops.</li><li>I was ready for a messy meal ... bib and all but everything was just so neat and tidy ( 3/5 stars).</li><li>The Trucker Special: 2 pancakes, 3 eggs, 2 sausages, 2 pieces of bacon, toast, potatoe hash, baked beans .... it was a pretty awesome brunch meal!</li><li>Flavors are authentic and the purple rice that accompanies your meal is crispy on the edges.</li><li>A very hearty and comforting meal, at a great price as well.</li><li>Before your meal they bring out tasty small dishes of kimchi, bean sprouts and other items to share.</li><li>A good choice if you want a simple warm meal to hold you through the night.</li><li>I could n't finish the crispy rice from the other hot stone pot, I was filled to the brim and the meal was only $ 10.</li><li>Averaging only $ 10 dollar per person, cheap and delicious meal- a definite return!</li><li>Always a great meal to have when it 's cold or if you feel under the weather.</li><li>The rice that comes with the meal is purple and I love the authenticity of the overall meal.</li><li>Like most other Korean Tofu Soup locations, they had meal options that included a soup, rice, and, of course, side-dishes.</li><li>I will give points for the super cheap prices, I think I paid $ 10 for the meal plus a pop.

Sharing: This is n't the restaurant to go to for a traditional 10-course meal but instead this is a restaurant to go to late at night or for a snack/casual meal.</li><li>MSG: I do n't go to CW that often but from what I recall last night as I was unable to sleep after a late night meal, I 've come to the conclusion ( because I 'm like Sherlock and I put 2 and 2 together) that Congee Wong puts too much MSG in their food!</li><li>Verdict: Fast meal, big portions, good price and tastes awesome.</li><li>The meal included the Super Bowl congee, half crispy chicken, chinese donut in noodle roll, deep fried shrimp dumpling!</li><li>Whenever we get back from a long trip this is the first stop we go to for a nice evening meal.</li><li>The place was clean and lastly, the meal was inexpensive!</li><li>They have this giant bowl of seafood congee that was really good, and it is big enough to make it a meal for four people.</li><li>Give em a try and enjoy your meal!</li><li>The food was average, but the three course meal ( soup, entree and dessert) for like $ 15 is like a super deal, while everywhere else around the city is like price gouging over the same holiday.</li><li>Each meal has cost in the $ 5 to $ 6.25 ballpark after tax, and was a hefty amount of food which in the case of the chicken rice combo 's, I was actually able to have enough leftovers for leftovers!</li><li>Overall, excellent meal at a very reasonable price.</li><li>Unfortunately, my first $ 20 meal felt like it should have cost $ 8, it was so bad.</li><li>I did n't have the misfortune of sitting down for the meal -- I had ordered food for pickup -- but while I was there, I was staring at a few cookers with soup left inside, and the inside of the cookers looked like one of those things left on the floor of tiny restaurants in Chinatown.</li><li>A wonderful meal, the daily special, took us through a wonderful plate of appetizers, a sizzling plate of prawns, butter chicken, aloo gobi, naan and rice, then dessert.</li><li>Service a little slow ( particularly at end of meal), but the food itself was sublime.</li><li>Sometimes when you just want a lite but filling meal, Subway is just the place to go.</li><li>It 's a great little place to have a quiet meal.</li><li>It truly tasted like a homecooked meal because everything was delicious and made with love.</li><li>A good-sized and very delicious meal.</li><li>The second time I came I got the meal w pancakes eggs bacon and sausage ( I forget the menu name) and it was great but I had to take half of it home.</li><li>At 4:30 pm, the 2 women and 1 men sat down at the kitchen counter and was having their meal.</li><li>The women came over and asked me how the meal was and I said it was `` Delicious''.</li><li>While some would call it a chintzy way to `` beef'' up a meal, I actually quite enjoy it when my meal is full of sprouts and other texturey vegetables- and I can be rest assured that the Netsu Ramen at Kenzo will satisfy my needs.</li><li>While some would call it a chintzy way to `` beef'' up a meal, I actually quite enjoy it when my meal is full of sprouts and other texturey vegetables- and I can be rest assured that the Netsu Ramen at Kenzo will satisfy my needs.</li><li>You want a healthy but filling meal for under 10 dollars ( with drink) ?</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
