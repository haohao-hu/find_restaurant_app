<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 455' %><h2>beef sashimi<br />occurrence: 10</h2><div><ol><li>I got a sashimi dinner, a selection of a la carte sashimi, beef sashimi, and several rolls.</li><li>Beef sashimi was terrible- dried out with out flavour .... tasted like the ones from AYCE.</li><li>Recommend beef sashimi and hamachi Kama for appetizer!</li><li>Other items, like the eel fried rice, sushi pizza, and beef sashimi was also very good.</li><li>Food was largely unremarkable, except for the beef sashimi which was amazing ( I do n't even eat beef but I made a 10 gram exception) and some of the sauces that were used with the grilled dishes.</li><li>Beef sashimi is to diiieeee for- soft and the sauce is great.</li><li>They only have street parking and there 's always parking officer roaming that street. they have a full wine/sake/soju selection and i get the impression that the staff are not quite knowledgeable. ive ordered beef sashimi, and chicken katsu in the past but i dont think that the quality is anything worth trying.</li><li>Beef sashimi was frozen.</li><li>ALL of these things were listed on the menu ... they also seem very stinge with everything. servings are small ... which could be a good thing ... i ordered beef sashimi .. that must be the most horrifying color i have ever seen ... it looked like rotting corpse from the walking dead color. just looked wrong .. please see pics. ordered the beef ribs ... it came out jet black burnt ... see pic. why would you bother serving it ? it makes no sense. the dude left a paper on our table and did not take the order, so i brought it to the front since i was going to the washroom ... he then gives me a lecture saying dont give orders to the front desk. i wouldnt have to if your service was better. water was never filled once. the only reason this place gets 2 star is because they had red tuna as a sashimi choice. which btw came out two different colors .. one time it was red .. the second time i ordered it was light pink ... i suspect they gave me F grade fish the second time around.</li><li>We were there to celebrate a birthday so my dad ordered various appetizers including beef sashimi ( tender and juicy, equivalent to eating beef tartare), a sushi boat ( featuring fresh spicy tuna maki, hamachi, toro, maguro, squid with salmon roe, and raw shrimp- good to order so that everyone at the table can sample different sushi and sashimi), the usual vegetables ( aka tempura), and blue tuna spicy and California hand rolls.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
