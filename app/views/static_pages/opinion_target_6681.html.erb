<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 6681' %><h2>steamed broccoli<br />occurrence: 1</h2><div><ol><li>Dak galbi ( marinated chicken stir-fry on hot plate- traditionally dark meat chicken is used, but I do n't know what kind they use here) is their specialty but a la carte menu is offered too. banchan has the usual napa cabbage kimchi, beansprouts, but the one i especially like is their simple but good steamed broccoli with a dash of gochujang. personally i like gochujang with everything, but it may not be fore everyone. they also have a mashed potato banchan which i did not try. if your order the dak galbi, i recommend extra orders of tteok ( rice cake sticks), sweet potato and pumpkin. cheese ( looks and tastes like mozzarella) is offered too, giving it a fusion/modern twist. ramen is also on the menu. service is attentive, friendly and pleasant. quite a roomy restaurant, which is surprising if you merely look from the outside. unlike many other korean restaurants in toronto, you can actually linger here for a while, given enough seating for everyone. will DEFINITELY come again.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
