<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 6969' %><h2>clamari<br />occurrence: 1</h2><div><ol><li>This location is not as convenient as their other locations if you are driving but perfect if you are using public transit as it is close to North York Station. stopped in this place for some apps and cake and we ended up with stomach aches. the whole experience was a dissapointment. we had clamari which was rubbery and a small portion. i am a huge calamari fan and this dish was a huge dissapointment. i have had calamari at the brampton symposium many times and loved it everytime. we also had a pita bread pizza type bread with gouda and chicken. the gouda was shredded and sparring. the chicken lacked flavour and fell off the pita with each bite due to lack of cheese to meld it all together. the cheescake was ok. it was extremely soft, nearly a mouse texture and it lacked the delicious graham cracker bottom which is my fav part of cheesecake. the chocolate caramel cake was also a mousse like texture. the caramel was drizzled on top and was eaten in two bites by my 4 year old. the cake lacked any other caramel flavour. it was a large piece and most of it was left behind. i ordered a steamed milk to go with the cake and they forgot to serve it. one star is generous for this place. i would give it a zero if i could.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
