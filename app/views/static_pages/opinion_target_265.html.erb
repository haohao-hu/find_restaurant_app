<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 265' %><h2>pot<br />occurrence: 21</h2><div><ol><li>It 's so much fun to scrape that off the bottom of the pot, and delicious too!</li><li>My friend and I ordered- steamed xo sauce pork neck rice: a little bland, and came with a bowl of cooked lettuce in soy sauce ...- stinky hot pot: really good, with intestines, pigs blood, enokie mushrooms, fish balls, and fish cake- mixed vegetables and tofu dry pot: it was okay- herbal essence jelly in coconut milk: awesome- mango freeze: she said it was awesome The decor is nice, the service is unfriendly.</li><li>Although I enjoyed my pot- I had the seafood version which came with scallop, sea cucumber, shrimp, and mussel, I 'm going to stick to their regular chicken soup next visit since I thought the amount of seafood given was not justified with the cost difference.</li><li>The lady took my Teapot as I showed her an empty pot.</li><li>We got the two-person pot that comes with a whole chicken, noodles and congee.</li><li>I thought it lacked flavour, but it was the dish that kept giving as 3 dishes came ou of this one pot.</li><li>They served in cute little pot and drink with shot glasses.</li><li>You have to pay $ 3.99 to add a soup and drink which I felt was very steep considering the soup is probably pre-made and just scooped from a big pot.</li><li>The prices were average for Korean food, the soups/stews ranged from $ 6.99- $ 9.99 and there were also options for hot pot and table top cooking.</li><li>Though there was a generous portion of chicken in the pot, our added-on rice cake and noodles were minimal, not enough for all three people to share.</li><li>Some of these extras are cooked within the pot.</li><li>I do n't have hot pot a lot but I wo n't be going to Richmond hill now to have hot pot.</li><li>+ They serve chrysanthemum drink instead of the plum drink that other places serve- they get you hooked on it and you 'll have to pay if you want more. + free WiFi- 4 people per pot- not enough strong fans.</li><li>Jook Sam Kyup Sal ~ squid spicy sauce with veggies, pork &amp; rice cake ~ Another type of table cooking, I love to munch on every thing here and rice is added at the end to make fried rice with the leftovers in the pot.</li><li>It was a nice dish when some of the spicy sauce was mixed in; the pot crisped the rice nicely, and the veggies were fresh.</li><li>The pot was sizzling when the waiter brought it and the rice was purple.</li><li>My friend stone pot was not used on his Bib Bim Bap.</li><li>At comparable restaurants, they charge you $ 3.50 for this rice + the rice stuck to the pot.</li><li>The service is fine, I like that the tea is served in the thermos pot which keeps it nice and hot and it is being constantly refilled with hot water.</li><li>It tasted like the sauce was mixed in with the pasta and it was sitting it a pot for a while in the back and they plopped in in my plate and served it to me.</li><li>When we got our bill we are suprised to find that the tea cost $ 3 per person ( which 4 us comes to $ 12 for the whole pot!), which is rather expensive!</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
