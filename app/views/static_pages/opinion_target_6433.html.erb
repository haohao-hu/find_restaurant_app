<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 6433' %><h2>beef barley<br />occurrence: 1</h2><div><ol><li>On the positive side, the Korean BBQ beef coleslaw sandwich and fries were really delicious ... i did n't even need to use their special garlic dill dip but i recommend ordering the dip with your fries to have a fresh change from ketchup sometimes. today 's soup was beef barley which was average as was the double amaretto sour however i was pleased they offered fresh options and could accommodate my off-menu drink request. final tip- do not order the nachos here. they were pretty bad ... happy i can always get great nachos at my joint fox n fiddle finch. hope the manager can fix the crappy service here because I 'd like to come back to watch a game and taste the fajita tacos, fish tacos or one of their tempting burgers. ok last last tip i dont know if i should write this but the servers are pretty so i guess that could be a plus for those who appreciate that sort of thing.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
