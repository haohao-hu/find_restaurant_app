<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1130' %><h2>kamjatang<br />occurrence: 4</h2><div><ol><li>At times, the soups can be too salty and the kamjatang is n't spicy at all even when requested to be spicy.</li><li>The place doesnt have a lot of food choices and I often order the kamjatang ( pork bone soup) Overall is good I think, although dont expect too much side dishes.</li><li>The kamjatang at the Yonge and Finch location is AMAZING ( and it 's opened 24 hours too!)</li><li>The food is edible but not great- the jajangmyeon tastes super watery and bland, the kamjatang is really oily and also bland ... basically the food here is bland and tastes cheaply made, but edible for a quick meal or for an after-drinking binge.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
