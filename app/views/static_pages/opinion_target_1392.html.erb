<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1392' %><h2>congee queen<br />occurrence: 3</h2><div><ol><li>No complaints but was n't fantastic either. i come here far too often ... to be honest im getting sick of it a little. but the food is not bad .. this is the closest you will get to cantonese cuisine downtown ( excluding spadina) ... congee queen is more north so its really the best you got if you live within this area ... fried turnip cake is good ... congee not bad. expect left overs when you come here as the serving size is generous.</li><li>You are the congee queen, young chow rice, and chow mien Congee queen, feel the meat from the spicy pork and bean You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the congee queen ------------- After a night out with my dancing queens, this queen is a classic Congee restaurant, where a group of us ordered one plate of food each to share, where not only we had enough to take home but it cost us $ 10 each.</li><li>Considering reviewing congee queen is like reviewing Asian Mcdonalds, I immediately said no. However, after coming home after our big meal and thinking about this, I realized that I need to be a better person and ensure that those who stalk me feel rewarded with an easter egg, I shall now write this one out for JT and RS.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
