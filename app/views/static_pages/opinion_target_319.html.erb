<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 319' %><h2>crabs<br />occurrence: 13</h2><div><ol><li>It 's made with raw crabs ( usually smaller and soft-shelled) and marinated with either soy sauce or spicy sauce.</li><li>Anyways, enough story about the type of crabs- so I decided to check this place out.</li><li>Ordered: Gae-Jang ( marinated raw crab) 2/5* Plate of marinated crab for $ 12.99* You can order soy sauce based or spicy sauce based* I ordered soy sauce based Gae Jang* Basically you get 2 small crabs all cracked up* Soy sauce marinade was decent but a little too sweet* What turned me off from this is how the crabs did n't taste very fresh* Although it is marinated, because you are eating this raw- freshness is quite important* My mouth felt a little dry/tough after eating this and it was n't very pleasant* The claw part was n't cracked and there was no way I could break it with my teeth* I was quite disappointed with this dish since I was looking forward to it Ordered: CheolPan JjooGgooMi ( baby squid stir fry) 5/5* Baby squid stir fried with vegetables and ricecake for two people at $ 19.99* This was recommended by my friend who 's had it before* It 's meant for 2 people and cooked at your table* This is very spicy ( be aware !!)* It came with lots of baby squid, ricecakes and vegetables* Sauce was very intense in flavor ( spices) and it was good to eat with rice* I thought it was kind of odd how they had broccoli in it* I loved this dish and would go back just for it Complimentary: Kong Bi Ji* This is a grinded up bean paste that people like to eat with the rice* I am not a big fan of beans .... or grinded up beans so I did n't really enjoy it* But my friend said it was really good!</li><li>I ordered the raw crabs in the special sauce, and the tofu stew.</li><li>I found that both the crabs and the stew was quite salty.</li><li>Since the crabs were kept whole- which is how it 's supposed to be anyways- I would have appreciated more if the staff provided us with a knife or scissors to cut the crab into bite size pieces.</li><li>I felt a bit of that rudeness when my bf asked the owner how good the crabs were because he 's never had them here in Toronto and the owner answered they 're the best in Toronto.</li><li>The crabs came first, and immediately I saw how small they were.</li><li>The crabs were quite salty, I recommend eating it alongside rice.</li><li>Although crabs were small but they were still very tasty.</li><li>First time, they were out of their famous crabs, so we tried the pork bone soup hot pot.</li><li>If I remember it right, it was almost $ 20 for three or four really small crabs.</li><li>The crabs were raw and seasoned with soy sauce and left in the sauce for around a week.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
