<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 319' %><h2>serving<br />occurrence: 16</h2><div><ol><li>Also, one thing to consider is that many fried items/skillets/kitchen items only comes in 1 piece when you put 1 on the order, as opposed to 1 serving.</li><li>The arugula and beet salad with goat cheese had very balanced flavours in a generous serving.</li><li>I have visited the place more than 50 times and I keep wondering how they manage to always keep around the most professional of service staff, I took 4 of my office associates out for lunch and we each ordered a drink, an appetizer and a main course, waitress serving us memorized each of our orders without writing it down, while some upscale places have up to 3 people serving a table of five and would still manage to misplace or confuse an item or two per order.</li><li>Good `` quantity'' of seafood and large serving overall.</li><li>I 'm not asking for your recommendation, you 're the one serving crappy pizza.</li><li>The serving was large and I took about 1/2 home.</li><li>It 's a family run restaurant and the son does most of the serving.</li><li>Our waitress had an attitude did not once check on us or ask us how our food was, and when we asked for water, the person serving looked like he had better things to do.</li><li>All in all though, I do n't think there 's anything distinctively special about this place, though if you want a large, unhealthy serving of meat ( we all crave this once in a while) then it 's a good choice.</li><li>The beef was juicy and the serving was pretty hefty.</li><li>The serving was huge and again, very generous with the toppings.</li><li>Again, they provide a generous serving.</li><li>But I could 've done with a larger serving.</li><li>The serving was small, way too sweet, and the whipped cream on top was gross and warm.</li><li>Service was very nice and serving was n't too slow.</li><li>Anyway the serving was massive.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
