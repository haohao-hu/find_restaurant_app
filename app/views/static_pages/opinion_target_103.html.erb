<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 103' %><h2>pita<br />occurrence: 55</h2><div><ol><li>Chicken on a pita is ok actually but the rest no so much.</li><li>Portions are pretty filling and with the pita and dip it 's more than enough.</li><li>Good pita, fresh salad, falafel was tasty ( but on soft side, I like mine crunchier).</li><li>Each main course includes a salad and pita bread. as well as a side dish.</li><li>I highly recommend the Neptune Salad or the Greek Salad ( if you order a large, the portions are very generous) with a warm pita.</li><li>The Souvlaki is ok, not the Best that I 've had ... but if you get the souvlaki sandwich, the pita is delicious!</li><li>The pita is unbelievably good.</li><li>My family also tells me the pizza and steak are amazing too, but I just ca n't seem to go there and NOT get the pork souvlaki on a pita!</li><li>She recommended the greek salad to share and the souvlaki with homemade pita.</li><li>The pita was probably the best ive ever tasted, and it was homemade!</li><li>The pita is fresh and pillowy, and the sandwich is stuffed with an array of fresh and pickled vegetables.</li><li>Balance your overstuffed pita in a paper plate as you make your way to one of several fast-food style tables.</li><li>They also somehow allow them to bud in line. just had food from here this morning, last night, earlier in the day yesterday, just after a first breakfast yesterday morning and im hoping to polish off the remnants over the next couple of days. hows that for committed ? like all great middle eastern places, i only have them when i am north of eglinton. this is not a frequent occurrence, for good reason. however, when im there, i delight in their robust falafel balls that crunch on the outside and warm your mouth with the softness of a pillow on the inside. this holds true even when they are cold- except for the crunchy part, but NEVER are they dry like virtually all falafel places south of there. the salads are fresh, tasty, albeit a little oily- but i cant resist the eggplant salad even though its bathing in oil. the pita is the only kind i enjoy- a big circular pocket thats fluffy and fresh. the hummous and tehina are perfect in their consistency, and spice. the only thing that i dont like from this place, is when you go inside and order a falafel sandwich ... its gargantuan ... so much so that you have no idea how to approach it ... and you want to approach it ... its like a hot sexy big assed, big breasted, big lipped woman. ( not quite sure if that metaphor worked but, i gave it a go at least.)</li><li>The last few times I ordered a falafel, the pita was sliced all the way around and caused everything stuffed in to fall out.</li><li>$ 5 for a massive, eggplant, hummas, veggie filled falafel sandwich which is literally bursting out of the pita.</li><li>Along with the pita that they throw in as well, it is one tasty meal.</li><li>That quote from the movie IS pretty much how I felt when I wanted to digest a piping hot, filled with tender pieces of roasted seasoned chicken, lathered in yoghurt sauce, with tahini spread across the warm soft pita, with crunchy radish pickles, fresh tomatoes and crispy lettuce: YUM!</li><li>The pita was warm and held together well all the way up to the end.</li><li>The pita was soggy, the toppings were n't fresh- lettuce was wilted and very old looking.</li><li>It had chicken, rice, two types of potatoes, salad, tzatziki, and pita.</li><li>The pita was fresh and the tzatziki was perfectly garlicky.</li><li>So you have your normal sized shawarmas in a pita- the portion you end up with when you 're in a touristy area and shawarma is the most exotic choice around.</li><li>Then you have your very generous, ballooning shawarmas in a pita- the kind offered by most authentic, hole-in-the-wall Middle Eastern spots.</li><li>Not the fanciest place around, BUT: the size of the pita pocket was HUGE, the chicken tasty, the vegetables definitely fresh, the hummous could have used a bit more garlic and lemon juice.</li><li>Do n't miss the best shawarma in Toronto, it 's a really huge pita with a different taste, very delicious, very delicious.</li><li>The pita was piping hot and was surprisingly good.</li><li>We get the moutabbal to start which I scoop up with their warm pita.</li><li>We 've reminded them that we needed warm pita on occasion, but they 've always brought it out happily.</li><li>We ordered a side of hummus and a side of baba ganoush and we had a lot of leftovers so we wanted pita to go and they say no you need to pay 50 cents for an extra pita ???!!!</li><li>We ordered a side of hummus and a side of baba ganoush and we had a lot of leftovers so we wanted pita to go and they say no you need to pay 50 cents for an extra pita ???!!!</li><li>Their pita taste like cardboard and it 's paper thin.</li><li>3 .Beef Shawarma Sandwich- Shredded pieces of beef grilled on a rotating spit with fresh parsley, onions, turnips, pickles, tomatoes and tahini sauce wrapped in a pita Being a beef person, I was a little disappointed with this.</li><li>Our pita was very old, their baba ghanoush is disgusting, they forgot to send our sauces.</li><li>Souvlaki, pita, salad, rice and the yummiest potatoes !!!!</li><li>It 's only fresh, fluffy pita here, none of that paper thin, stale garbage most places pass off.</li><li>Is n't that why I ordered a pita ?</li><li>Koobideh on a pita ( with salad) for $ 4.95.</li><li>They also have plates of hummus and baba ghannouj that are flavourful and pair well with fresh pita.</li><li>Put some meat in your pita, throw some garlic/hummus in there, some rice if you want, then cover it all in sauce: make your OWN wraps!</li><li>The falafels were crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, loved the creamy hummus with soft warm pita and the tabbouleh was really good ( just a little too strong on the lemon juice/vinegar ?).</li><li>After years away, we returned and spend a Saturday afternoon eating in silence as we dipped warm pita into Lebnah and hummus.</li><li>The pita was typical store bought stuff, no big deal, and my Arabic coffee was eh, but those are small potatoes.</li><li>Other notable dishes are the Fatouche ( tomato, cucumber, mint, sour sumach, and toasted pita), ful bean dish, and of course the tabbouleh.</li><li>The pita they served were store bought.</li><li>They always load up my pita with everything I like and it makes for a great little meal with lots of veggie options and various sauces.</li><li>And the pita was amazing: D I absolutely used to love coming here when I lived in the area.</li><li>It comes wraped in warm toasted pita with all the veggies and served with a delicious tahini sauce.</li><li>Also, they did n't give us an option with the usual sauces like other Osmow 's when they 're about to wrap up the pita or whatever.</li><li>The pita was lightly toasted to a perfect crunch.</li><li>Big hunks of extremely flavourful chicken, tasty rice, a pita and tzatziki sauce.</li><li>The laffa ( flat pita) is cooked right in front of you in a stone oven fresh to order and it alone is unbelievable.</li><li>The pita 's are very big and very filling.</li><li>The pita 's are a teeny bit sweet and very soft.</li><li>I 'd love to just get a package of their amazing pita ... and the eggplant ... and the pickled veggies.</li><li>This location is not as convenient as their other locations if you are driving but perfect if you are using public transit as it is close to North York Station. stopped in this place for some apps and cake and we ended up with stomach aches. the whole experience was a dissapointment. we had clamari which was rubbery and a small portion. i am a huge calamari fan and this dish was a huge dissapointment. i have had calamari at the brampton symposium many times and loved it everytime. we also had a pita bread pizza type bread with gouda and chicken. the gouda was shredded and sparring. the chicken lacked flavour and fell off the pita with each bite due to lack of cheese to meld it all together. the cheescake was ok. it was extremely soft, nearly a mouse texture and it lacked the delicious graham cracker bottom which is my fav part of cheesecake. the chocolate caramel cake was also a mousse like texture. the caramel was drizzled on top and was eaten in two bites by my 4 year old. the cake lacked any other caramel flavour. it was a large piece and most of it was left behind. i ordered a steamed milk to go with the cake and they forgot to serve it. one star is generous for this place. i would give it a zero if i could.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
