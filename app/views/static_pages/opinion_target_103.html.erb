<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 103' %><h2>lettuce<br />occurrence: 66</h2><div><ol><li>Whenever I call to them about my issues they never really seem to apologize, rather blame it on me; `` you did not tell me no sunflower seeds'' ( i did) `` do n't leave the salad in the car or the veggies get brown'' ( i never do) `` my chef forgot to put in the carrots, I will give you extra next time'' ( I watched her make my salad, not a chef &amp; my salad literally had lettuce, cheese and 4 mandarin oranges in it).</li><li>The garden salad is a hit with me, I worship anyone capable of throwing tasty home made dressing together, the lettuce is crispy fresh as are other ingredients which makes for an uplifting combination with the dressing.</li><li>The only thing that was not great were the fries, they were mushy because if the way the container is designed and the lettuce in the salad was turning red ( stale).</li><li>In the sandwich, they add lettuce, tomato, mayo, mustard on a kaiser bun.</li><li>The guys behind the counter here are pretty generous with the amount of rice, vegetables ( e.g. lettuce, pickel, onions, beets), and chicken they pile on your plate.</li><li>The chicken itself has a pretty good flavor, but the wilted lettuce and sorry looking toppings always have me disappointed, and somehow there were fruit flies buzzing around all the veggies even though it 's- 4 degrees out ..</li><li>Look to pay about $ 6 for a delicious chicken shawarma, complete with mostly fresh toppings ( the lettuce was slightly wilted and a little brown each time I went).</li><li>I ordered up a Chicken Shawarma with all the fixins ( garlic, hummus, lettuce, tomatoes, tahini, and extra hot sauce).</li><li>And sexy summer rolls are the non-fried ones- they have avocado, lettuce, crab or shrimp, other greenery and come wrapped in a see through rice paper. yummmmzeeerrrzzzzz The staff at the Sheppard and Yonge location are super nice.</li><li>The pita was soggy, the toppings were n't fresh- lettuce was wilted and very old looking.</li><li>The other was vermicelli with just the cucumber, peanuts, lettuce, radish &amp; carrots.</li><li>Caesar salad properly balances fresh, cool dry lettuce and clingy garlic-charged dressing.</li><li>The sandwich is then stuffed with tomatoes, lettuce, coleslaw, hummus, and garlic or tahini sauce.</li><li>Portion was quite tiny though- they covered most of it with lettuce, which was a bit odd.</li><li>She vouched for the sushi set lunch but I was royally disappointed when I asked for the vegetable maki set ( $ 9.95) and they gave me giant maki rolls filled with ... ugh, lettuce.</li><li>It had a mix of salmon and tuna ( I think) sashimi overtop lettuce, beets, avocado and a mix of other vegatbles and nori.</li><li>My salad, was ok, but how do you fail a salad ? forget the lettuce ?</li><li>For today 's review, let 's go with the bullet point format: Negatives:- Greek Salad is simply green lettuce with Feta Cheese sprinkled on it ( Kidding right ?</li><li>The Nacho burger had a six oz patty ( you could choose a whole wheat or white bun) topped with guacamole, tomato salsa, lettuce, cheddar cheese and jalapeno sour cream.</li><li>Even the good lettuce and tomato cannot save the burger portion.</li><li>One bite I tasted mushy flavorless refried beans, another bite, dry and tastless lettuce.</li><li>The lettuce was all over the place and sour cream was placed right on top of the lettuce instead of with the meat.</li><li>I was extremely hungry and back at the office, I was in my own little world as I bit into warm sauce, beans, lettuce, tomatos and chicken all-in-one-bite.</li><li>The vermicelli also has the perfect balance between the noodles, lettuce, pickled cucumber and carrot.</li><li>It 's a pita wrap filled with chicken shawarma and your choice of lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, green olives, hot peppers, and some others.</li><li>I had a pozole ( spicey stewed pork, corn soup), it was a good portion as it came with a fried tortilla with sour cream, and all the condiments to put into the soup ( radish, lettuce, oregano, cayenne pepper powder, onions) my husband had the combo which came with an enchilada, a burrito, and refried beans in a taco basket.</li><li>The lettuce was the best part of it, totally!</li><li>I 've been here more than 10 times for sashimi, maki, hand rolls and Ha Da Bap ( the sashimi with lettuce and seaweed on rice).</li><li>A Caesar salad had lettuce that was reasonably fresh but appeared to be sliced with a knife rather than torn and cheap tasting dressing that seemed like the kind that comes out of those little plastic packages at fast food restaurants.</li><li>Side dishes: lettuce, bean sprouts, kimchii, sweet radish, kimchii flavored radish and peanuts with little dried fish The meal was good but nothing really stood out for me.</li><li>Comes with tofu soup or soy bean soup, lettuce ( for wrapping), two sauces ( one tasted like peanut oil and salt, and the other was ssamjang ( a spicy seasoned bean paste), raw garlic slices ( for putting in your wraps) and two bowls of white rice.</li><li>I think it 's the kitchen/deli staff that needs management, they distracted our server few times, and than served sandwiches with stale lettuce and tomatoes.</li><li>I do n't know about anyone but i like my cheese melted on my eggs. just picture this sandwich: dry cold egg, on warm bagel, with stale lettuce and tomatoes, between cheese and egg, with no sauce or butter or anything that would make the sandwich stick together, beside the juice from the runny old tomatoes.</li><li>They did n't put any onion, lettuce, fresh tomato, or tabouli.</li><li>The salad is chopped, tasteless lettuce, with half a styrofoamy tomato on top, and your choice of Kraft dressing.</li><li>The lettuce they used was selected properly in that they were all solid bowl shaped.</li><li>The lettuce wrap was delicious- the lettuce was fresh and the filling was perfectly seasoned.</li><li>We had a platter of tofu, cold pig ears, pork belly, veggies, Peking duck two ways ( wraps and lettuce), fried rice, and lobster.</li><li>It comes with lettuce and seasoned lettuce.</li><li>For $ 45 the meal came with the beef sirloin, two bowls of purple rice, lettuce wrap, seasoned lettuce, onion pancake, an assortment of 8 side dishes and a bowl of seafood soon tofu soup.</li><li>It 's a meal for two with lots of meat, lettuce, soon tofu soup, and rice.</li><li>They also serve an appetitizer of pickled radish, lettuce and coleslaw.</li><li>The crepes do appear to be a bit better and the ice cream dish that looked like leaves of lettuce was pretty good.</li><li>You also get a separate plate or container for salad which you can help yourself- the salad is quite plain though about 95% lettuce or you can take coleslaw or cheap pasta salad.</li><li>Then you pick your meat ( chicken, beef, pulled pork, pulled beef, fish and shrimp) and toppings ( four salsas, cheese, beans, sour cream, lettuce).</li><li>The lettuce was crisp ( void of brown spots), the tomatoes were fresh, the salsa was flavourful ( though spicy is not so spicy), and the cheese smelled and tasted just fine.</li><li>The standard burrito build is rice, your choice of re-fried or black beans, grilled veggies ( mixed peppers and onions mostly), mild or medium sauce, both tomato and corn salsas, cheese, lettuce and sour cream.</li><li>The cesaer salad that I loved was way too salty and the lettuce was old.</li><li>The food was meh ... the garden salad was pretty gross as the lettuce used was obvi old.</li><li>My co-worker seemed to enjoy her salmon salad, and it did look pretty fresh ( at least the lettuce did, I 'm not experienced with smoked salmon to make that observation).</li><li>One time my Gf and I did table cooking and lettuce, to get more lettuce we had to pay more ...</li><li>One time my Gf and I did table cooking and lettuce, to get
