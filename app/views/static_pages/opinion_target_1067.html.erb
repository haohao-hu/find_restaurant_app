<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1067' %><h2>fried fish<br />occurrence: 3</h2><div><ol><li>The raw crab here is not my type, but the seafood pancake is nice, the fried fish is delish, spicy chicken pot is good but they give less chicken than lim ga nei, side dishes r good Service here is friendly Small family-owned restaurant tucked away under the apartment complex.</li><li>The chow mein was good but typical, the vegetables and shumai were okay too, the fried fish served with the egg soup sauce was freshly fried and glorious.</li><li>I came late to meet with my party so I did n't get a say in what to order but we did get gam ja tang ( which was good- not as flavourful as I 'd like), the fried fish ( I think mackerel) was good as well although I usually do n't like it.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
