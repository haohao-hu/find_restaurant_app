<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 6264' %><h2>desert menu<br />occurrence: 1</h2><div><ol><li>Completely ruined our night ... whats worst is that we did n't even get an apology ... food is actually not that bad. the shrimp tempura was excellent. the waiting staff was atrocious. super slow and just brain dead. the only person who cleaned our table was the manager! the desert menu is very small. the also did not have a lot of the stuff that was advertised on the menu. i did like how they made the maki rolls with real japanese rice. we paid about $ 71 for two adults and a 4 year old, tips not included. the decor is pretty awful. the chairs were very ugly. it was very dark inside. we sat near the windows so that helped a bit in terms of lighting. i will never come here again.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
