<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 491' %><h2>Chicken Katsu<br />occurrence: 9</h2><div><ol><li>Pros:- Price is on point at $ 20 + tax/tip on a weekday- Chicken Katsu was well made.</li><li>Chicken Katsu was very crunchy as well and was accompanied by a refreshing salad ( Japanese cole slaw ?).</li><li>Stick with the fish items because things like chicken katsu or teriyaki can be obtained elsewhere for similar quality.</li><li>I guess it 's something that got stuck, but if I need a chicken katsu, naturally I come here.</li><li>There chicken katsu here is pretty good ......</li><li>The chicken katsu is great but they are most well known for their green dragon.</li><li>I sat down and immediately munched down on some awesome chicken katsu.</li><li>They only have street parking and there 's always parking officer roaming that street. they have a full wine/sake/soju selection and i get the impression that the staff are not quite knowledgeable. ive ordered beef sashimi, and chicken katsu in the past but i dont think that the quality is anything worth trying.</li><li>In terms of food, one of my friends ordered a chicken katsu which did not come with the sauce, and we had to tell them to take it back and add the sauce back.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
