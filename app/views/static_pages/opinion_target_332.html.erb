<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 332' %><h2>buffet<br />occurrence: 15</h2><div><ol><li>The buffet is flush up against where the food comes out of the kitchen, so buffet goers have to negotiate some tight turns with the wait staff.</li><li>Would not come back again. the search is over! this buffet is on par with Tenichi. after reading reviews on here, I decided to head my way down to Finch and Leslie Friday for dinner. arrived at 6pm and the place was full already.</li><li>The buffet ( which is not all you can eat) is pretty cheap ( around $ 6) Your food is given to you by a server- they will give you a HUGE amount of carbs- usually either plain rice or pasta- I 'm talking two or three cups of rice, and then a smaller amount of protein ( whatever they 've made that day) quality ranges from pretty mediocre to quite good, but it 's pretty much luck of the draw as to what they decided to make that day.</li><li>Also, their $ 20 buffet is a steal.</li><li>The buffet is not.</li><li>Great small buffet.</li><li>So I asked how much the buffet was again and had to ask `` 8.99 ? not 18.99 ?'' in order to understand.</li><li>The buffet also has a great selection of food and the desserts are great as well.</li><li>I filled two bowls for one meal which came out to one bowl at the end, The guy working the grill was friendly and fast, The buffet was great, lots of options, I loved the shau mai ( which I know I did n't spell correctly) and the lotus seed bun as well as the fried goyza ( again another spelling mistake;)) The dessert was nearly the best part of the entire meal, there was a lot of options and the slush machine and chocolate fountain had to be my favriote.</li><li>This buffet is a bit short of a typical big Chinese buffet.</li><li>The buffet is kinda mediocre in my opinion.</li><li>The buffet is good too if you do n't trust yourself ...</li><li>The buffet had a number of standard items, such as spring rolls, hot and sour soup, General Tso chicken, and much more.</li><li>The buffet was average, nothing great but for the price, OK ... and then I went up for a second run at this str fry thing.</li><li>Went for lunch today, the buffet was not refilled at 1pm.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
