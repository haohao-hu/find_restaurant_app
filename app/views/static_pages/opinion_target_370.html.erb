<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 370' %><h2>bbq sauce<br />occurrence: 13</h2><div><ol><li>The meat did n't have this char grilled flavor or anything, it was just coated in this addictive bbq sauce that made me want to run back and ask for a bottle.</li><li>No BBQ sauce and honestly they looked like they had been put in the microwave.</li><li>The chicken breast was n't too dry, and went very well with the BBQ sauce on the side.</li><li>Bbq: fried chicken coated with their tangy, sweet and a tad spicy bbq sauce.</li><li>I do n't know what it was really supposed to actually taste like, but it was strips of pork in a bowl of grease ( not your `` greasy goodness'' ... it was literally a bowl of oil) with a sauce that seems reminiscent to Kraft BBQ sauce.</li><li>As you work your way through the chicken and salad, the rice ends up being coated in a mixer spicy BBQ sauce, garlic sauce and which ever salad dressing you chose ( ranch for me!) leaving a sloppy mess of yumminess at the end.</li><li>The box comes with a BBQ sauce but it tastes like tomato sauce.</li><li>The chicken was moist and juicy with a fresh tasting BBQ sauce.</li><li>Asked for some hot sauce on the side, got some sweet BBQ sauce instead.</li><li>The pulled pork sammy was bland and simply tasted like BBQ sauce.</li><li>We both found our meat fell right off the bone and something especially wonderful to me was that I was able to order dry ribs with BBQ sauce on the side.</li><li>The pulled pork was ok, but what stopped it from being great was too much bbq sauce and fried onions.</li><li>This is not your usual BBQ ribs where the BBQ sauce is grilled on it so I was scared it was gonna be dry. but it actually amazed me !! even tho i ordered the sauce on the side I didnt need it cuz it was sooo flavourful and the meat was so tender it shocked me.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
