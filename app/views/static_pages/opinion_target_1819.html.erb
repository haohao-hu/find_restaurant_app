<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1819' %><h2>cartilage<br />occurrence: 2</h2><div><ol><li>Went here on Thursday night for wings ... got there at 1:00 am ordered the wings and happened to find one that was littered with hair, not talking about 1 or 2 hairs ... but several hairs ( I wish I took a picture) ... the server tried to tell me that it was not hair but left over cartilage that they missed when cleaning the chicken ( I did n't know cartilage looked like hair) ... the shocking part to me was that she acted as if everything was cool and that I should just put it aside, only after I made enough noise, they finally decided that they would take 1 of the 2 pounds that I ordered off if the bill ... if you ask me ... my whole meal should have been free .... seems like they need to learn a thing or two about customer service.</li><li>Chicken that is tasteless and chewy and `` cartilage'', mushy salty rice and Kebbeh that is drenched in oil that when you pick it up oil just drips from it is NOT appetizing.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
