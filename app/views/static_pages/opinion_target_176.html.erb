<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 176' %><h2>lasagna<br />occurrence: 29</h2><div><ol><li>Its menu not only had all the same items as DD but it also had lasagna, soup combo!</li><li>The recommendation from other post on Lasagna is not what I expected, the lasagna turned out is only mediocre.</li><li>I had an excellent sausage, black olive and cheese pizza, and my fiancee had the lasagna.</li><li>This place has some of the best lasagna I 've ever had.</li><li>Cheers to the grappa! 3.5 Had I reviewed this place a month ago, I would have felt confident giving it a 5-star rating- our server that first time was energetic/friendly, and the lasagna I ordered was quite possibly the best I have EVER had ( see picture).</li><li>My recent second trip here though was disappointing, which was a bit embarrassing people I had hyped up the restaurant ( and lasagna) quite a bit to a group of my foodie friends who came with me.</li><li>Perhaps it was the late hour, but my second try of the lasagna did not meet the initial expectation- it was drenched with sauce this time, which really diminished the taste all of the formerly beautifully constructed sheets of pasta and ricotta.</li><li>Our server that night did n't seem too interested in making any changes after my friend and I mentioned the `` lasagna soup,'' so now I wonder which version of the lasagna was the fluke.</li><li>This place looks to have many other great pasta choices that are worth a look ... and you may be lucky enough to have the 5-star version of the lasagna, rather than the 3.</li><li>We ordered the veal capelloni and the lasagna.</li><li>The lasagna was decent but certainly did n't shine compared to the veal.</li><li>We went for a family reunion dinner and this place was such a surprise.Everything we ordered was so tasty, fresh and hot.From the mushroom salad to the lasagna to the pasta pescatore all were superb.I heartily recommend this place to any discerning lover of fine italian food.Please continue!</li><li>Soup was too salty, their carbonara is too bland ( with nothing in it, just pasta and milk/cream) and the lasagna was okay but the presentation was n't really nice.</li><li>The lasagna was a large portion.</li><li>Others found the shepherds pie to be only alright, and the lasagna to be okay.</li><li>One of the best lasagna in city, which is worth the drive here.</li><li>The lady at the counter was super friendly and mentioned that the lasagna and stuffed peppers are homemade and incredible.</li><li>The lasagna was good.</li><li>The sandwiches are substantial and the lasagna was great ( second only to my Italian friend 's mom).</li><li>I did n't think the pizza was anything special but the lasagna was great!</li><li>The lasagna is chalky, and tastes like they used frozen meat sauce, as it has a bland taste so never mind the prices, it 's awful.</li><li>The food is as I anticipated, pretty good, especially the lasagna, worth going back there for that.</li><li>My parents ordered a lasagna and fish dish, resepctively.</li><li>We were told they had the 3rd best lasagna in the city and the waiter recommended the Parmesan Chicken.</li><li>I got the lasagna, which is not bad, I can eat it.</li><li>The lasagna was very soft and the sauce was irremarkable.</li><li>I had the lasagna for my main and you can taste the freezer burn and the veggies in it were GROSS.</li><li>I usually get the lasagna, with the generous amount of sauce and ground beef.</li><li>The lasagna was very good.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
