<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 38' %><h2>drinks<br />occurrence: 183</h2><div><ol><li>This place is capable of producing the same variety of drinks and food as Destiny 's tea shoppe, and that 's rather impressive for such a humble space which used to be a cracked out Coffee Time.</li><li>The drinks here are acceptable, probably on par with Destiny.</li><li>I can understand why the service is lacking on a weekday lunch hour since there is only 1 waitress who taking orders, making drinks and desserts and delivering the orders from kitchen.</li><li>The drinks were okay.</li><li>This place is just ok overall, although drinks are generally impressive, food is also not bad, but service-wise, it fails!</li><li>The staff are very quick to clean up your plates and bring your drinks.</li><li>They have only 2lt bottles and not all the drinks.</li><li>Check out the pictures below to see the drinks:) I love second cup coffee specially the flavored once.</li><li>There are definitely better bar around the area that have better food and drinks.</li><li>Food and drinks are priced right with some appetizers given.</li><li>It does n't even include soft drinks.</li><li>Soft drinks are only $ 1.</li><li>BUT the astricks state that you need a MINIMUM OF FOUR PEOPLE pay for DINNER PRICES ... drinks are not included ...</li><li>The drinks are cheap, the games are always a playin ' and they have some food specials sometimes.</li><li>Great food, very chill atmosphere and great drinks ( Asahi Black is an amazing beer you ca n't get at lot of other places).</li><li>Our drinks were refilled every couple of minutes ( we drank a lot of tea).</li><li>Service is great, fish is fresh, drinks are cold, booths are intimate.</li><li>We ordered Chirashi Sushi Dinner, Beef enoki roll, Sashimi Dinner, and Shrimp and veggie tempura udon, For drinks, a bottle of wine and Hoggarden on tap.</li><li>Great quality sushi, fun for occasions with a group or a romantic night out for dinner and drinks.</li><li>I 'm thankful there 's finally a place to hang out and have drinks with friends and not have to be annoyed by drunk rowdy people.</li><li>Drinks- First and foremost, drinks are refreshing, plentiful, and they 've got something for everyone.</li><li>Went here for drinks too late night and it 's a good time A little more pricey compared to the other sushi places around, but the presentation of both the food and the atmosphere inside is very classy and upscale.</li><li>I 'm happy to see a mature enough crowd here that knows how to have fun with good food and drinks.</li><li>My problem is I find them to be a little snobby, the sushi sucks ( does not taste fresh seaweed always like rubber) and they are a little over priced on both drinks and food.</li><li>I had the tataki attacki roll, sashimi dinner plate, dynamite roll, kamikaze roll, lots of drinks.</li><li>Not only is the food super tasty, but they have great drinks too!</li><li>The Service: Pretty good service- there was only one waiter running around making our drinks and taking our order, at the same time running over to the next door bar to serve people there.</li><li>They have a large selection of drinks and cocktails if you like that.</li><li>Their soft drinks are fine.</li><li>My friend and I both ordered drinks and shared a bingsoo, which was good, but nothing over the top.</li><li>I 've tried many of the warm drinks and they are usually very sweet, which I prefer anyway.</li><li>Their drinks are standard bubble tea cafe price and decent but not amazing, but I 'd go somewhere more legit next time ( somewhere Taiwanese as opposed to a Korean BBT cafe such as Green Grotto or Gong Cha).</li><li>Note: parking is easier to find/access through the back street and drive through the side of the building vs dealing with traffic at Wilson Note II: Pay by cash only, go up to the front to pay at the cashier Great pho, vermicelli, rice, and drinks.</li><li>The waiter asked what we wanted to drink and when we told him water, he then told us the coupon wo n't work unless we both order drinks.</li><li>4.5 for ambiance 3 for the drinks.</li><li>We all had drinks- the wine was great ( we ordered a some, although they also do BYOW, which is a plus) and I tried a Raspberry cocktail which was also great ( served in a mason jar with mint).</li><li>Overall, I really enjoyed the food, drinks, ambiance and service, so definitely willing to come here more often now.</li><li>The only part that was satisfactory were the drinks and coffee.</li><li>She took our drink and food orders and came back with the drinks promptly, soda for me and wine for the missus, and brought water as well.</li><li>The bartender is always very friendly and quick with the drinks.</li><li>The service is good and the food and drinks are good.</li><li>We went for late night drinks and it was n't too busy.</li><li>The server even offered us free drinks because he felt that he did n't check up on us enough.</li><li>They also have several drinks on hand including mango which I love! good alternatives to pop. So we are in the middle of moving.</li><li>Tried Lunch today great service and great flavorful foid Haleem tasted perfect for kids, medium spicy 2 haleem, 1 charga, a doz kabob, 10 naan, 2 lassi, 4 drinks cost around $ 110 not including tips, its pricy for 4 kids and 4 adults but if u can afford worth eating awful customer service experience.</li><li>The moment she came back with the drinks she seemed in some kind of hurry to take my order.</li><li>They served our food before giving the drinks.</li><li>Finally I got up and asked the manager why our drinks were not served yet.</li><li>It 's not acceptable for any restaurant to serve food before the drinks.</li><li>With 8 people back at our table and two of us trying to manage to order the drinks and food for everyone, I was exhausted and frustrated.</li><li>We had to make several requests for garnishes, drinks and cutlery.</li><li>We continued to eat the dissatisfied meal, where the lady did n't even bother to ask if we wanted a refill on our drinks, which we clearly needed since our glass was empty!</li><li>This location is very convenient and they always seem to have inventory of the drinks I tend to buy ( definitely a plus in my books).</li><li>Free drinks.</li><li>Food came out speedy, empty dishes were cleared promptly and drinks were always refilled.</li><li>4) their drinks are unlimited.</li><li>When we sat they brought our food relatively quickly, and always refilling our drinks and clearing our plates as soon as we were done.</li><li>It has the standard fare of sashimi, rolls, hot foods, cold apps, dessert and drinks, just as it does with forgetful service and not serving you 100% of what you asked for.</li><li>The price is right and the drinks are included so that 's a plus.</li><li>Soft drinks were included.</li><li>Sad, but true! 3.5 stars for the food! there 's a lot of choices and some of them are reaalllyy great but I 'm a huge fan of sashimi and it 's not amazing here: p but! + another 0.5 for their bigger dessert selection ANDD their free soft drinks!</li><li>Plus soft drinks are included in the price.</li><li>Although not as good as Kaka AYCE due to lack of torched sushi, it offers scallop sashimi and unlimited free drinks and these make up for it.</li><li>What i like about this place is that they included free drinks on the ayce menu.</li><li>There are a variety of desserts too and soft drinks are included.</li><li>Soft drinks are included, also dessert YumYUM !!</li><li>For me, a warm cup of coffee though weak compare to my usual preferences, but i is a life saver after a few drinks!</li><li>Scrumptious food, nice manager, cute children, free wifi, food comes with drinks during lunch, lots of outlets to charge tablets and phones, very considerate restaurant!</li><li>The waiter was very prompt and gave us good tips on choosing food and drinks.</li><li>The points below describes our third experience: Our drink order was taken about twenty minutes later, and it took an additional 25 minutes to receive the drinks.</li><li>Usually, drinks take about 5-10 minutes to arrive.</li><li>I made a comment that the drinks took too long.</li><li>We wanted to ask her something about the menu and she stopped us mid question and insisted on bringing the drinks first.</li><li>Reasonably priced entree 's and cheap drinks.</li><li>You can never go wrong with Japanese cuisine and they have lots of drinks, so even if you just wanted to pop in for Sake, this is a great place.</li><li>Drink quality is good and I 've never had to wait long to order or get my drinks.</li><li>The drinks are pretty decent but I did n't love any of the ones I 've tried so far.</li><li>Love this chatime- great drinks, very clean, and nice place to chill.</li><li>Reasonably priced drinks with very authentic taste.</li><li>Because it is a chain joint, the drinks do n't taste any different to me compared to the other two locations ( yes, including newly opened Markham one).</li><li>I was hoping to order my drink in the super cup and instead of explaining that I am unable to order certain drinks, I was given a vague answer.</li><li>They come out with new exciting options all the time such as their World Series or Nutella drinks.</li><li>And just like Starbucks, their drinks are pricey.</li><li>When drinks were ready for pickup, he screamed out loud with such tone as `` get your drink and get the fuck out of my store''.</li><li>He lined up 4 different drinks and would n't even tell me which one was mine.</li><li>Most of the drinks are consistently good.</li><li>We order, get our drinks for takeout, and leave.</li><li>Overall, great for the drinks.</li><li>I went there with my friends 3 times and their drinks were inconsistent.</li><li>I really like how they let you choose the sweetness and ice level, since a lot of other bbt places often make their drinks too sweet or too cold.</li><li>Otherwise the drinks are good the place is good, just sucks when you have to wait for the long lines in the summer.</li><li>Their drinks are also consistently good, but my favourite has to be their most popular, the milk tea.</li><li>Most of the drinks are available warm as well as cold--perfect for the chilly, rainy spring we 've been having: ( I ordered the roasted milk green tea, as it came highly recommended both on Yelp and by the friend I came with, and it was a great choice for a warm drink.</li><li>If you go often, definitely get one of their loyalty cards ( 10 drinks any size = 10 stamps, and get the next regular sized drink free). consistent quality and flavor.</li><li>Their drinks are usually consistent good quality.</li><li>We ordered our drinks and they came quite quickly.</li><li>The drinks were yummy and the interior decor was cool and unique.</li><li>You can get a points card to collect points towards free drinks.</li><li>Our meals came out at the same time as our drinks, so surprisingly fast.</li><li>The waiter was quick with our drinks and food and was helpful with suggestions.</li><li>The drinks were fair with their daily specials.</li><li>Next time I would like to have a few drinks over dinner- ca n't wait to go back for another round!:) First time at an authentic korean family restaurant and I was blown away by the food.</li><li>They had other wait staff refilling drinks and removing plates, so we did n't see him often.</li><li>What we ordered: Drinks- Lemon basil martinis- these are always excellent at Linda, and we enjoyed them very much.</li><li>The drinks were good, I got the basil lemon martini.</li><li>We actually had to get up and walked up to the bar to grab more drinks.</li><li>With drinks/ tax/ tip, expect it to be about $ 20 per person.</li><li>And some of the drinks came- and then we re-ordered our drinks because we were told we did n't order our drinks.</li><li>And some of the drinks came- and then we re-ordered our drinks because we were told we did n't order our drinks.</li><li>Then our drinks were done, and we wondered where our food was.</li><li>We did have to wait a while to get our drinks, we thought she had forgotten and turned out she had.</li><li>I do not advise you follow my lead unless you like super salty drinks.</li><li>Delicious food and great drinks!</li><li>I also like some of the glasses that they use to serve some of the drinks.</li><li>But I found the drinks to be overpriced.</li><li>If you want to sit back, relax, have some good drinks, and alcohol is n't your thing, go to ten rens! 3 stars because it 's not spectacular.</li><li>The bbtea is great but be ready to wait for a ridiculous amount of time, the drinks are cray expensive for what they are, and they do n't take credit card.</li><li>The place felt like a cafeteria and the drinks did not come in glass cups, but in plastic takeout cups.</li><li>The price is not bad but drinks are so so.</li><li>Though their drinks can be pricier, you will taste the difference.</li><li>We ordered 3 drinks and a lunch combo, the drinks came fast but the food took forever, seems like there was only 1 person working in the kitchen.</li><li>We ordered 3 drinks

they charge.</li><li>Their drinks are average, and I have nothing to complain about there.</li><li>However, they do have very good tea and non-alcohol drinks.</li><li>However, the drinks here are nothing more spectacular than the drinks at Tea Shop 168.</li><li>They got their drinks and appetizers so quick and we waited there for 30 mins and nothing came to us.</li><li>They did n't ask us if we wanted drinks and did n't provide drinks until we asked them.</li><li>So my friend and I left the store to buy some drinks.</li><li>For a family of four we each had an entree, side salad and drinks ( Non-alcoholic).</li><li>We ordered 2 large size sets ( on another note, my god they are big!) and they gave us a small fries with large drinks ... not a huge deal, but just the principle that if you

desert date with great teas and drinks.</li><li>They way they make any desserts or drinks is made with love.</li><li>Workers are friendly and I 'd come here again to try more of their menu:) I love

taste less sugary and more the taste of the names.</li><li>The drinks here are n't bad and they have Asian fusion style drinks such as sweet potato cappuccino which was very interesting.</li><li>Since

over priced, but whatever.</li><li>The bar/cash counter need some work looks disgusting u wo n't imagine u get your drinks there. ( Thumbs down!)</li><li>You can even get vietnamese drinks here or just bubble tea, and it 's not that bad either.</li><li>Drinks are extra cost, but they do have a variety of drinks to choose from.</li><li>5 mins to get the standard 4 banchans and our drinks.</li><li>But it 's only really worth a rave after 2am ( when the better spots a few metres away close shop) and after a few drinks.</li><li>The drinks ( bean with coconut) were n't mixed and the coconut was just a blob of coconut that I had to mix in myself.</li><li>All cool so far ... we got our drinks and waited for the first delivery.</li><li>Our waitress was nearly useless in terms of notifying us of the daily special, soup, the drinks, the portion of the nachos and it took forever to get our bills.</li><li>The Drinks: The drinks are amazing from their alcoholic beverages to their coffees/lattes and specialty hot chocolates.</li><li>Long list of unique hot and cold drinks, deserts and appetizers.</li><li>Before it closed, it was an excellent place to dine or have drinks with friends.</li><li>The Hawaiian pizza we split was great and we liked our drinks.</li><li>Took the server 10 minutes to come to our table and then took an additional 20 minutes to get our drinks.</li><li>The drinks are also really good and decently priced.</li><li>Onion rings were the bomb and drinks are refills.</li><li>I was hoping for something out of the ordinary for drinks but nope.</li><li>Regardless, come here in your dress clothes, sweats, or jeans and I am sure you will enjoy the food and drinks! + Extensive brunch menu.</li><li>Service was impeccable, food and drinks amazing.</li><li>It should only be asked once if any alcohol drinks would be liked.</li><li>Everything goes well with the Guatemalan hot sauces, and the imported Latin American soft drinks.</li><li>Ordered soft drinks, which never came, instead Mr. Engrish-as-a-2nd-Language promptly brought us ice water with lemon wedges.</li><li>When our drinks needed refills no one was there to take care of that and when we tried looking for our server she was no where to be found.</li><li>I absolutely love this bar, it 's got great service and is always a good time to hang out with friends to grab a few drinks.</li><li>Be sure to come here for a few drinks on a night where you just want to hang out with some friends.</li><li>When the server came to get our drinks, we asked for a few minutes before ordering, He says `` okay cool'', and threw the drink menu in a pile near a computer.</li><li>The drinks waiter had never heard of a common aperitif.</li><li>3 stars for decent food and drinks.</li><li>Word to the wise, avoid cocktails or mixed drinks here.</li><li>It did take awhile to get our drinks ( water and an iced tea) tour table.</li><li>Went for lunch, was busy but never really waited on anything, not food or drinks.</li><li>Because we got the coupon deal we ended up paying $ 36 for 2 with drinks and tips.</li><li>Drinks are pricey.</li><li>They also have some selection of drinks and desserts.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
