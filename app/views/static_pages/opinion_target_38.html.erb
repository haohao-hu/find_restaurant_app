<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 38' %><h2>pork<br />occurrence: 214</h2><div><ol><li>Large chunks of slow roasted pork, however, the pork was cold.</li><li>In this past year, I 've been there for 2 times. the most recent visit I took a few pictures, the sweet &amp; sour pork with the orange slices ( please see pictures) beside the S &amp; S pork, the 3 of us ordered the Kalbijim ( Beef Rib Stew) and the Kimchi fried rice. the banchan are good, wait, they are great.</li><li>I like the fried zucchini the most, the kimchi has a spicy-sweetness with a bit of sour, and the broccoli with the white salad dressing was the best. unfortunately the main was not as good anymore. the kalbijim was not tender at all, and there is n't any potato or radish with the stew. while sweet and sour pork tasted ok, but the sauce was a bit thick, and the batter too. the worst was the Kimchi fried rice, the potion was really small, almost no Kimchi in it, and it taste really sour, not in a good way. and the fried rice was n't hot, not spicy hot and not temperature hot, yet it just came out of the kitchen less than 5 minutes after we order it.</li><li>Traditionally, Korean dumplings are filled with mixtures of tofu, shredded cabbage, bean sprouts, pork, shredded kimchi and so on ... so their fillings are less firm than Chinese dumpling fillings.</li><li>I 'm also a big fan of their Bo-Ssam ( boiled pork) served with cabbage and oyster kimchi.</li><li>The sandwich had a good serving of pulled pork on peameal bacon.</li><li>The pork was delicious, juicy and tender.</li><li>Everyone knows what they 're getting into with it; lo mein, spicy pork, etc.</li><li>They had salads, eggplant, veggies to the cooked meat from chicken in various styles from baked, breaded and stuffed to fish and pork.</li><li>I got for the pork, and he gets the lamb.</li><li>Had lots of pork, beef, shrimp and vegetables.</li><li>Ordered the spicy pork deopbap and my girlfriend ordered a bibimbap.</li><li>The pork was pretty tasty and I liked the stone bowl, but I did n't find anything else too special about it.</li><li>They specially in samgaetang which is a special healthy and delicious chicken soup ( with rice and noodles) but my boyfriend is obsessed with the spicy pork which is served sizzling on a hot plate with rice and side soup.</li><li>Cutlet pork was awesome too.</li><li>The spicy pork tastes home made.</li><li>What we did n't like: Spicy pork Dupbab Also ordered it as take-out.</li><li>The pork was on the very spicy side and I can eat spicy.</li><li>Shredded pork in garlic sauce had a spice that I could n't place but did n't like ... a lot of dishes seemed to have traces of this spice and it made all the food taste the same.</li><li>Bound by ancient laws and traditions, simple prohibitions against eating pork or seafood, or boiling a kid in it 's mothers ' milk have given rise to a series of increasingly restrictive rules which speak not only to the food that ends up on one 's plate, but the plate itself, the kitchen that prepares the food, and the whole supply chain from farm to table.</li><li>The pupusas are made to perfection, perfect ratio of masa to pork and cheese.</li><li>Or the sweet potato and pork is very bony, again few good pieces of meat.</li><li>If you stand outside the store for 10 minutes you will notice people walking consistently ( a person a minute) and coming out with a styrofoam container ( jerk chicken, pork or stew) or paper bags ( Jamaican patties, or Jerk Chicken on a bun).</li><li>I usually get a small pork, small chicken, two patties, and a coleslaw to share between two people.</li><li>But their deep fried dishes are a bit lacking and not crunchy enough despite the batter they use ( sweet n sour pork, small fishes).</li><li>I ordered a beef burrito, 2 pulled pork hard tacos and a chicken quesadilla.</li><li>The pork was very nice and tender.</li><li>The pancit was looooooooooooaded with shrimp, pork, and chicken.</li><li>It also came with 2 sauces on the side ... no idea what they were, but they did go well with the pork.</li><li>LOVED the crispy prawns ( spicy) and the crispy pork.</li><li>Tried the crispy pork that everyone recommends, it 's not bad, has crispy skin but the meat is on the dry side, definitely tried much better one elsewhere Since we came in 5, we got to try multiple dishes.</li><li>The spring rolls with shrimp and pork were ok.</li><li>My go to dishes are:- Banh beo bi- Banh cuon ( with/without sausage)- Com thap cam ( grilled pork, grilled chicken, shredded pork, steamed egg, fried egg)- and of course PHO!</li><li>The fresh rolls with shrimp and pork also good, pork was sliced thin enough unlike some places too thick.</li><li>The fresh rolls with shrimp and pork also good, pork was sliced thin enough unlike some places too thick.</li><li>- Enoki pork roll- a fantastic combo of tasty pork and the satisfying bite of enoki mushrooms- squid sushi- possibly the best sashimi squid I 've ever had.</li><li>I had a quail egg ( tasted canned), a wonton ( lots of shrimp and pork filling, I wished there was more than just 1), a shrimp ( a good size, but not completely de-veined), 2 pieces of squid ( tasted rubbery), a piece of BBQ pork ( good flavour and not too fatty), 2 pieces of thinly sliced liver ( I do n't usually like liver, but this was ok), 2 pieces of thinly sliced heart ( I gave this to my dad because other than liver I do n't eat organ meats), and a fried fish ball sliced in two ( tasted good).</li><li>We got an order of pancake and it was this fabulous looking thing ( see my pics) stuffed with bean sprouts and bit of shrimp and pork.</li><li>However, be warned, the last time I was there, I ordered this dish and the pork was not tender ( very dry).</li><li>The pork in their pork bone soup was actually meaty!</li><li>Even though this is supposedly a sushi place, I already have my favourite spots for good sushi so this is simply one of my go-to spots for breaded deep-fried pork cutlet-y goodness!</li><li>The chunks of pork were huge.</li><li>Jerk pork is one of the best I 've had.</li><li>I have n't tried their other dishes but they would use the same pork or chicken in the sandwich as they would for their dishes.</li><li>I did n't order but we had the General Tao Chicken, black pepper sizzling beef and some noodle dish with pork and shrimps.</li><li>I had a regular sized bowl of congee with shredded pork and preserved egg and an order of the fried bread fritters.</li><li>They had a lot of pork on the menu.</li><li>The food is good, but not worth the teeny portion size they give you. ... while i 've always known this place existed, it 's hard for me to remember that it 's there to try it out. located in a plaza on don mills but you ca n't really see the storefront and if you 're not looking for it you 'll drive by it completely. finally we got dinner takeout as we were searching on yelp. we ordered: live whole lobster with efu noodles- excellent. yeung chow fried rice- good, but the peas were slightly undercooked. sweet cruller rice noodle rolls, good. stir fried beef with vegetables, good. deep fried squid tentacles, good. fried turnip patties Singapore style, mediocre. sweet and sour pork, excellent. the food was great, the prices are definitely cheaper than congee queen. all of that for $ 70, and they deliver for orders over $ 25- which i did n't know until we picked up the food. love delivery, especially for the winter- will definitely return!</li><li>It could have been hotter, but tasted nice and had a good amount of pork and noodle.</li><li>A couple years back I guess due to the relative obscurity of the `` bun bo Hue'' dish, they renamed themselves adding the `` pho'' as that seemed to be the only food non-Vietnamese knew about Vietnamese cuisine Let 's get to the food: bun bo Hue is a vermicelli dish, with beef shank, pork, lemongrass and lots of other herbs.</li><li>Bun Bo Hue is actually the name of a noodle dish- a spicy noodle dish made of beef, pork and vermicelli.</li><li>Everything tastes pretty great especially the pork and squid thing and the portions are pretty massive.</li><li>The broth was a bit on the salty side, but other wise perfect, with large pieces of meltingly soft tofu as well as seafood and pork.</li><li>We had a group of 6 and ordered a set meal that came with noodles ( and some veggies) in soup, seafood pancake, Tangsuyuk ( Sweet, sour, and crispy pork), bulgogi in a pot where the server cooked for us, and pork bone soup, and of course several side dishes.</li><li>However, the regular one made with chicken and pork was perfect for Chinese tastes.</li><li>I 'm not as much a fan of He He Long 's duck nor their crispy roast pork ( see my other reviews for THE BEST roast pork anywhere) but I do love their char siu pork!</li><li>Sauce is delicious and the flavour of the pork is just right.</li><li>I was really craving some BBQ pork and chicken.</li><li>I chose well today- the glaze on the pork was good ( not too sweet) and I chose a lean piece which had loads of flavour.</li><li>Chicken was ok- pork is better.</li><li>I came in today and asked for the most tender BBQ pork they could give me, because I just had my wisdom teeth removed and I ca n't really chew yet.</li><li>When my pork was being cut, I could see the meat almost melting beneath the weight of the cleaver because it was so moist and tender.</li><li>If you 're coming here to grab a hot meal- you should be here for the Cevappi, which are a ground meat sausages made with veal, lamb and pork.</li><li>He ordered Singapore Noodles and was expecting the usual fried curry noodles with shrimp, pork, and chicken and instead got a soupy concoction with shrimp.</li><li>The Jerk chicken is quite good as well, but not as good as the pork and can be slightly dry depending on the day.</li><li>Jerk pork is very flavourful, not overly salty, and most importantly not dry.</li><li>I love the rice and peas that sit underneath the pork, and its topped with some cabbage and carrot slaw.</li><li>Another time I went there and got a lb of pork and the food was COLD.</li><li>Great pork.</li><li>Their jerk chicken and pork are the best.</li><li>Jerk chicken here can be a bit dry so opting with the pork is the ideal plan here.</li><li>The pork has this wonderful little bark too which I love about the meat.</li><li>My pork was on the lean side.</li><li>This restaurant is traditional Chinese except they do not serve pork but do have a large selection of lamb dishes.</li><li>I order katsu don the pork tasted old and expired.</li><li>We made it very clear that as a dietary restriction, I do not eat pork and asked for the bacon and sausages to be substituted for turkey bacon.</li><li>The salad rolls are pretty standard, but they have been upgraded recently to include more spring onion and pork ( used to only be shrimp).</li><li>Food:- vermicelli noodles 3.5/5- char sui pork 4/5- sweet and sour chicken 4/5- fried spicy turnip capes 3.5/5 ( make it crispier!)- shrimp congee 4/5 ( fresh shrimp)- sizzling plate with beef and mushrooms 4.5 ( you can taste the ginger!)- Salt and pepper calamari 3.5/5 ( too chewy) Everything was fresh and hot.</li><li>You are the congee queen, young chow rice, and chow mien Congee queen, feel the meat from the spicy pork and bean You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the congee queen ------------- After a night out with my dancing queens, this queen is a classic Congee restaurant, where a group of us ordered one plate of food each to share, where not only we had enough to take home but it cost us $ 10 each.</li><li>I usually start off with a bowl of shredded pork and preserved egg congee with a bit of pepper or chili oil and the fried donut to dip.</li><li>We ordered:- fried chili turnip cake -- strong garlic flavors but super tasty- pork and thousand year old egg congee -- super fast service; delicious comfort food- assorted BBQ meats ( honey roasted BBQ pork, roast duck, and roast pig) -- AMAZING!</li><li>We ordered the two-meat combo, and we had the choice of any two pork, chicken, or duck.</li><li>Sweet and sour pork is a kids favourite.</li><li>We had to ask for an additional table to keep the kid from grabbing the BBQ pork ( though who could blame him, pork is delicious!).</li><li>Next we were tantalized by the infamous turnip chili patties, which are like a sexed-up Sino-fied version of homefries and the final tease for Abbas was the chili pork ( you see pork is to Abbas, what Magic Mike is to Sara, deeelightful!)</li><li>Disgusting bits of rubbery pork that was probably alive last century.</li><li>The pork was NOT BBQ.</li><li>Sausage &amp; minced pork rice with egg: rice was way over cooked, mince pork tasted nothing but soy sauce, egg was burnt on one side, vegetable look and tasted like left over from 2 days ago coming straight out of fridge.</li><li>The starch on the pork were very uneven, some pieces have more starch than pork.</li><li>I would admit that they gave a generous amount of pork, cabbage and noodles.</li><li>I enjoyed the noodles, they were not soggy but very tender however, the pork ...</li><li>It definitely looked odd and it did n't taste exactly like pure pork ...</li><li>Tonight was minced pork and sausage rice along with a grape green tea bbtea.</li><li>This is a place to go for those who want it and also want All you can eat. the RIbs were good and a high point, as well as the spicy pork.</li><li>For about $ 28 after tip and taxes on a Friday, you get mounds and mounds of Kalbi ribs, bulgogi beef, pork, and other variations of Korean meats.</li><li>They have pork, beef, chicken, short ribs, and pork belly marinated in Korean BBQ Marinade.</li><li>We had 6 choices: pork belly, beef short ribs ( kalbi), chicken, spicy pork, pork and bulgogi.</li><li>We had 6 choices: pork belly, beef short ribs ( kalbi), chicken, spicy pork, pork and bulgogi.</li><li>I do n't order anything but beef, so I ca n't speak for how good the pork or chicken is.</li><li>I had the pork bone base and the pork bone meat itself was actually really good.</li><li>The beef and pork were chopped and cubed, and tasted average.</li><li>I ordered the Chishan Mian and while I really liked the texture of the noodles, the soup base was just alright but there was barely any pork in the soup, which was quite disappointing.</li><li>The pork is marinated to perfection, not to saucy or salty.</li><li>The pork was juicy and the dense bread soaked up the pork grease/juice.</li><li>The pork was juicy and the dense bread soaked up the pork grease/juice.</li><li>The pork inside was also very tender and juicy, and together with the bread it was perfect.</li><li>Potato Jia Mao tastes good, the pork one was too greasy for my taste.</li><li>It has many more menu options than I expected- we opted for the `` pork jia-mo'' and a `` soy beef stew noodle''.</li><li>But the pork was so juicy it was dripping on to my fingers and it was worth the wait.</li><li>We had the spicy tofu with pork and rice and some steam buns.</li><li>We ordered several plates of dumplings, sadly most of them were pork ( my cousin ordered not realizing that my sister does n't eat pork or beef).</li><li>I also did n't care for the sesame biscuit with egg and dried pork.</li><li>It was topped with a sauce of minced pork and preserved vegetable.</li><li>Ordered: Porkbelly BBQ ( Sam Kyup Sal)* Pork belly BBQ served with mushrooms, onions and veggies for wrapping* You cook this on a BBQ grill at your table* Served with green onions and you can add it to your ' ssam' Green onions with chili powder and some vinegar for you to eat with the grilled meat Ordered: Marinated Beef ( Ju Mul Luk)* Beef mixed with veggies in a sweet sauce* I much prefer this over Bulgogi which I find it to be too sweet* This you also cook at your table with the grill Ordered: Kimchi Stew ( KimChi JjiGae)* It was interesting to see vermicelli in a Kimchi stew* The soup was just spicy enough and not too sour* Usually you eat this with a bowl of rice Ordered: Dumplings ( Mandoo)* These were Mul-Mandoo which means it is cooked in boiling water* You dip this into soy sauce Ordered: Spicy Soup ( Jjam Ppong Tang)* This is usually a noodle dish but this specific one was made without for drinking* It makes a nice dish to order when you are drinking soju* Filled with seafood and veggies Ordered: Seafood Pancake ( Hae Mul Pa Jeon)* There was n't much seafood in the pancake* I did n't really enjoy this Ordered: Spicy octopus &amp; pork* This is a table top cooking with veggies, octopus and pork* You can adjust the spiciness of this dish* Usually comes in 2 portions but we added an extra serving* Because there was so much food it did take a while to cook Conclusion: Now that I 've been back 3 times and tried couple things off their menu, I am convinced that even from their never-ending menu- they serve good Korean food.</li><li>Ordered: Porkbelly

some of the items were, I had the Pork Bulgolgi Ddukbaeki and it was $ 17.</li><li>I do n't know what it was really supposed to actually taste like, but it was strips of pork in a bowl of grease ( not your `` greasy goodness'' ... it was literally a bowl of oil) with a sauce that seems reminiscent to Kraft BBQ sauce.</li><li>The kimchi chigae ( stew with tofu, pork, and kimchi) was a big letdown.</li><li>Got the pork one soup hoppy.</li><li>Love their kam ja tang as the pork is tender and it literally comes right off ..</li><li>And my Yelp Friend ordered: Budae jjigae- A huge hot pot of hot dogs, pork, ham, veggie, instant ramen and even a Kraft cheese- I felt like I am back in my University years that I would just throw anything in some spicy broth and start eating, the good old days ...</li><li>I opted for the spicy pork ( $ 14), which was alright, but it 's literally a big plate of pork and a bowl of rice, so in terms of a balanced meal with vegetables, it 's lacking.</li><li>The pork was good though.</li><li>The spicy pork hot plate had barely any meat, the pork was all fat.</li><li>The spicy pork hot plate had barely any meat, the pork was all fat.</li><li>We ordered the hot table bacon for 2, a pork bone soup and a beef broth soup.</li><li>I ordered the Pork Bulgogi Ddukbaegi ( marinated pork in sweet &amp; spicy soup cooked in a hot stone pot).</li><li>The pork was really crispy, but I would have enjoyed it more if they went easier on the brown sauce.</li><li>Sweet &amp; sour pork was all batter- not an ounce of meat to be seen.</li><li>The green beans with pork was excellent and so was the bok choy with oyster mushrooms and tofu.</li><li>Fav dishes: aforementioned Yaka Mein, steamed pork, sesame/butterfly shrimp, lobster sauce ( order it as a side without the shrimp to save a bit of $ $), Chinese sausage fried rice.</li><li>I had the wonton soup which had a few nice hunks of pork in it- and then followed up with a beef lo-mein.</li><li>They use the part of the pork that make soups.</li><li>Maybe I did n't like it that much because I was just too full and had just finished a pork bone soup at Lim Ga Ne but I do n't think this is the case.</li><li>Previously they did n't have pork in their menu at all ... which I found very odd because a lot of Filipino food consist of pork.</li><li>Previously they did n't have pork in their menu at all ... which I found very odd because a lot of Filipino food consist of pork.</li><li>It was quite good, but I would definitely recommend adding mayo in that sisig for extra yumminess ( that 's how we make our pork sisig at home and trust me ... the flavours are bolder).</li><li>They also have different variations of Soontofu/Soondubu- kimchi, seafood and I believe pork.</li><li>Ordered #3 with beef, pork, tofu spicy kimchi.</li><li>I ordered the pork and tofu jigae and the dishes came out under 10 minutes.</li><li>I opted for the kimchi soon tofu with beef and pork, regular spicy.</li><li>Nonetheless, I was willing to try something different so I ordered Kimchi Soon Tofu + Dolsotbab ( kimchi, beef, pork).</li><li>The kimchi tofu was awesome with the mix of beef, pork and kimchi and I got it regular spicy which had just enough kick.</li><li>My partner had the beef dumpling soon tofu which was the only item he could have since he has to avoid any type of shellfish, pork or mushrooms ... probably wo n't be returning because of this ...</li><li>Ordered the pork Katsu arrived with hard pork no rice or salad.</li><li>Ordered the pork Katsu arrived with hard pork no rice or salad.</li><li>Then you pick your meat ( chicken, beef, pulled pork, pulled beef, fish and shrimp) and toppings ( four salsas, cheese, beans, sour cream, lettuce).</li><li>Tasty pork filling.</li><li>The choice of protein is standard with chicken, steak, pork, fish, and shrimp.</li><li>The pork was juicy and the rice had a good flavor.</li><li>I could just eat pork bone soup everyday of the week if I lived close by ...</li><li>The soup is quiet large, there is a massive pork bone bathing in pork broth.</li><li>Perhaps the name is appropriate after all, as deciding on a meal of hearty Pork Bone Soup with a nice beer, can at times, be a wise choice indeed ....</li><li>The pork was really flavorful, served with a generous amount of vegetables ( green peppers and onions).</li><li>You do n't really come here for the ambiance, but for 2 main dishes: ( i) pork bone soup and ( ii) LA galbi ribs.</li><li>The pork is soft and tasty.</li><li>I placed an order for pork bone soup for takeout ( not the first time I 've ordered this either in store or take home).</li><li>I also recommend any pork dish, since their pork is light yet flavorful.</li><li>The curry was good besides the fatty pork and awful potatoes.</li><li>We ordered the braise pork balls and when we sliced the ball in half, the PORK WAS RAW.</li><li>This is 2012 and serving raw pork, where is the quality control ?</li><li>We ordered the usual staple chinese foods such as sweet and sour pork, fried rice, veggie dishes, and a variety of other dishes that all tasted fresh.</li><li>Initially wanting to just go with something light- somehow we ordered crab tofu, Shanghainese seafood noodle, beef pancake rolls, fried whole fish in brown sauce, garlic stir fried string beans, appetizer platter sampler ( drunken chicken, jellyfish, and pork ?) and two orders of crab meat soup dumplings ( yep too much food for the 5 of us).</li><li>Soup dumpling with scallops and pork $ 6.99- its $ 1 more than the standard pork soup dumpling and honestly I could not tell the difference.</li><li>I would stay away from the Westernized dishes ( e.g. beef w/ broccoli, sweat &amp; sour pork, etc.) as I have n't found them to be any good.</li><li>Do n't try other dishes like stirring fried vermicelli ( poor portion and bland, for all the Cantonese dishes, I recommend congee Wong nearby) or traditional Chinese dishes like fish flavoured pork slices ( 鱼香肉丝 ）, sweat &amp; sour fish is a big joke ... check out my photos--it 's even a joke for the Westerners, okay ?</li><li>This dish is a mixture of rice cakes, cabbage and small strips of pork.</li><li>Lots of flavour, no lack of pork or bones, and good amount of thoroughly cooked potato.</li><li>The Pork Bone Soup came out FAST and the portion size I 'm quite happy about.</li><li>I especially like their pork bone soup and broiled mackerel!</li><li>I had the pork tonkatsu with stir-fried egg and rice which was pretty tasty and comforting.</li><li>The portion of pork was big with about 3-4 mammoth sized bones full of meat.</li><li>I really like their Pork Bone Soup because it is spicy which is my favorite taste.</li><li>I 've had their pork bone soup and it was delicious.</li><li>The menu says they have chicken, pork or beef bibimbap but that 's a lie.</li><li>The pork could 've been a bit more fatty to give it better flavour as it was relatively lean.</li><li>It was a little on the dry side but I think it was because the pork had no fat in it.</li><li>Not to mention the food, which was amazing, had the Cuban sandwich, which was a ton of delicious pork on a soft ciabatta roll.</li><li>It looked more like a small hunk of pork, coated in sauce, that someone had stabbed with a fork a few times ... also, it was n't hot, it was room temperature Overall we got decent quantity but not fantastic quality.</li><li>Pulled pork was bland, dry and smokeless.</li><li>Pulled pork tastes lik ... pulled pork.</li><li>Pulled pork tastes lik ... pulled pork.</li><li>But the pork was not smoked. this place did n't deliver the goods unfortunately.</li><li>Soup #2 was a kimchi tofu soup of sorts, with pieces of pork in it.</li><li>I liked their sweet and sour pork- crispy and not too greasy- but I think this place is too over-priced.</li><li>We ordered 4 dishes, the special sweet and sour pork, beef with vegetables, chicken with vegetables, and mushrooms with vegetables.</li><li>As I do n't eat pork I love the Turkey Bacon option.</li><li>We irdered a mix of table and a la carte Table cooking Fresh beef ( looks and price loke wagu) $ 31 very small portion and not work the price Short ribs good but pricey at $ 30 Special Sliced pork belly $ 20 very good but I usually order the regular pork $ 17 ( best bet) A la carte Ka ja tang solid Bi bum bap good The side are a little better then the other korean place around and found the Noodle side dish with seasame oil excellent but they do offer free refill on that dish.</li><li>I assumed she 'd bring pork but she came with some small pieces of bulgogi looking meat.</li><li>We did wait a long time for our dishes though, especially the pork and rice cakes.</li><li>The pork was crispy and tender.</li><li>She brought one out and my cousin asked for another box as she wanted to take the pork home since she did n't eat it and only drank the soup.</li><li>She insisted to get a soup container for the pork but I explained that there is no soup we just want to take the meat.</li><li>Pick your meat ( pork, lamb, beef, chicken or several different kinds of seafood), veggies ( plenty of options), noodles ( 3 varieties) and sauce ( large selection of pre-mixed or create your own) and hand your bowl to the cook who has it ready for you in a minute or so after tossing it around on a huge hot plate with no oil, just water.</li><li>The novelty with the Mongolian Grill is that you are presented with a wide variety of raw meats ( beef, pork, chicken, and lamb) and vegetables, some seafoods ( shrimps, fake crab and squid rings), noodles ( egg, rice, udon, etc.) and a stupefying selection of soupy sauces ( spicy, curry, honey garlic ... more than 10 in total) and condiment sauces ( ginger, garlic, oyster ... more than 20 in total).</li><li>To round out my experience I also had beef with vegetables which came with baby bok choy and broccoli; Singapore style vermicelli noodles with pork and shrimp and pork and shrimp fried rice.</li><li>To round out my experience I also had beef with vegetables which came with baby bok choy and broccoli; Singapore style vermicelli noodles with pork and shrimp and pork and shrimp fried rice.</li><li>I know, I know, I doubled down on the pork and shrimp- so shoot me!</li><li>We had tried their House supreme, seafood supreme, multigrain, preserved egg and pork, scallop n shrimp, clams and salted egg, and house chicken congee.</li><li>The congee here is first rate, especially the pork and preserved duck egg and the duck and chicken.</li><li>We decided to order the supreme super bowl congee, cantonese chow mein, three kinds stuffed vegetables ( eggplant, tofu and green pepper), minced pork and dried fish green beans and fried chili turnip patties.</li><li>If not this, then the lean pork with the thousand year egg.</li><li>It was still as magical as I remembered, the pork + perserved egg congee was smooth and satisfying.</li><li>We picked the lean pork and preserved egg congee.</li><li>We ordered several dishes: Scrambled egg &amp; shrimp, wonton lo mein, yeung chow fried rice, peking style pork &amp; crispy chicken.</li><li>It was n't too much or too little in terms of pork or preserved egg.</li><li>I ordered the shanghai noodles which had pork and shrimp in it.</li><li>I typically go for the `` King Ramen'' due to the additional pork, and spicy base.</li><li>The pork is so tender, you do n't really need to use your teeth.</li><li>It 's a complex broth that has hints of seafood, pork, and msg.</li><li>There are grill parks on the round pieces of pork.</li><li>For our appetizer, we ordered the gyoza which were MASSIVE and fresh: you could really taste the pork, ginger, garlic and green onion with every bite.</li><li>The pork is tender, well-cooked and plentiful while the broth is rich, complex and well-balanced.</li><li>I believe it was a miso base with pork and vegetables.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
