crab, abalone -- I would have expected the chef to choose ingredients that are finer or of higher quality or just special in some way to substitute.</li><li>The Lobster and Shrimp Coddled Eggs was a bowl of buttery heaven which was made richer as you spooned into the egg yolks which intertwined in between chunks of lobster and shrimp.</li><li>The Lobster and Shrimp Coddled Eggs was a bowl of

Shrimps, and from the Chef 's Specials: a linguini with half a lobster and shrimps, and an herb-crusted sea bass.</li><li>An actual medium size piece of lobster- not the cheap shredded kind.</li><li>Ordered: Coconut Shrimps* 5 pieces of coconut shrimps for $ 9.75* Shrimps were butterflied and deep fried with actual coconut bits in the batter* When it arrived, it was just luke warm* And the sauce looked like it was from McDonalds ( seriously ?)* I was the one who wanted to try them and boy, did I regret ordering these* For $ 10, this was def not worth it Ordered: Lobster Bisque* Small personal lobster bisque for $ 8.95* This was n't very hot either but it was delicious!* It is super creamy and rich with lobster meats* My dad loved this and finished a entire cup himself* It is def not cheap but very much worth it Ordered: Jumbo Garlic Shrimps* 9 jumbo shrimps Butterflied and Baked $ 25.50* If lobster is not your thing, they always have shrimp dishes* They were perfectly cooked and had good flavor with garlic bits* It was kind of on the dry side but with the melted butter it was fine* I just tried one of this and my sister had the rest of it Ordered: 2lb Steamed Lobster &amp; 4lb Broiled Lobster* 2lb lobster was $ 57.00 and 4lb lobster is $ 97.00* You can choose the lobster to be steamed or broiled* I mostly had the broiled 4lb ( obviously shared it with others)* Steamed had much clean taste since no other seasoning was used* Broiled lobster tasted more rich with the crust on top* 4lb lobster was so huge the claw was as big as my face* They get pretty messy to eat so you are given a plastic bib to put around your neck Summary: I walked in not expecting much but I fully enjoyed the meal at The Lobster Trap.</li><li>Ordered: Coconut Shrimps* 5 pieces

walked in not expecting much but I fully enjoyed the meal at The Lobster Trap.</li><li>You ca n't really go wrong with lobster when they are fresh and I did enjoy the home cooked style the restaurant offered.</li><li>The lobster was gross, old, chewy, over cooked and certainly not fresh.</li><li>200.00 for four dinners, no one finished their lobster it was so bad.</li><li>My friend and I ordered: The muscles appetizer One lobster combo One lobster 2 glasses of white wine.</li><li>I ended up with a lobster bisque -- which was too creamy and very skimpy on the lobster.</li><li>The lobster was tasty.</li><li>Their lobster is not tasty and their portion sizes are small.</li><li>Stay away from this restaurant you have been warned. it 'll be the first time and most likely the last time i 'll go there. i had high expectations of a place that has lobster in their name coupled with the fact that they are in one of the more higher end areas of the city. maybe that 's the downfall. from the outside, it looks like a place that you 'd find in a old strip mall, and the interior 's more of the same. when i saw that the food and wine menu were both laminated, i started to get an idea as to what i was getting myself into both pricewise and food quality. our server was not the most attentive to our needs even though we were a group of 12, and was noticibly pushing certain items on the menu. there were also a couple of kids with us and she was n't the most friendliest person with them, seemingly just focused on doin what she needed to do to make her coin and turning the table over. not that i find it wrong but it 's not something i 'd expect from a place that you 're paying up to $ 94 for a four pound lobster. me and my friend ordered garlic shrimps to start. they were of a decent size and flavour but were lacked presentation and quantity for what we paid. i 'm not really concerned with presentation that much on the regular but the plate they served it on made it look like we were n't getting a lot or we were missing something. we both ordered a 1lb lobster with baked potato and soup. we were informed that the french fries were not available which again i would n't expect from a place where you are paying so much for your meal. my soup was a new england clam chowder that was nothing special at all. the soup nutsy or even the marche had better. the baked potato was plain with just a small dollop of sour cream to consume it with. the final item to arrive was the lobster. i ordered for it to be broiled which it did but the ' stuff' ( cause i do n't really know what the heck they decided to put on it) just made it a very messy proposition to eat. it did n't really do much to enhance the enjoyment of the lobster, and it made me wonder was it really worth the coin i just dropped for this. the whole meal just tasted only just average. the whole experience was topped off when our bill came and our waitress almost made it a point to point out that the gratuity was not included in our bill. if you really want lobster, i would just say to go to red lobster and do it there. you 'd probably pay just the same but the service would definitely be better and so would the flavours !!</li><li>Stay away from this restaurant you have been warned. it 'll be the first time and most likely the last time i 'll go there. i had high expectations of a place that

ordered the 2lb king crab dinner market price witch was $ 86 and a lobster tail $ while we were at the table a waitress was showing a almost four lb lobster to a child I must admit looked delicious.</li><li>I 've tried my bf 's meal and the lobster is done to perfection.</li><li>The bottom line is the lobster is still very good but the lobster bisque is out and the price has been increased.</li><li>2) Lobster meal ( 1 lb): The lobster was split in half and my friend and I each got a half.</li><li>My boyfriend is a bit of a seafood connoisseur, so after eating crab and lobster a dozen of times at Chinese restaurants, Red Lobster and at home, we decided to go for something different.</li><li>Now, if you 're interested in getting a real seafood experience, i.e. digging into the seafood and not just eating the claw/tail of the lobster, then go here!</li><li>Then we both shared a huge lobster, I believe it was 6-7lbs that we hand picked from their aquarium.</li><li>They steamed the lobster and split it right down the middle!</li><li>We usually get a lobster ( maybe 1.5 lbs) broiled, salad, fries or roast potato, drink, garlic bread and awesome lobster bisque.</li><li>The lobster is very fresh and price is reasonable ( around $ 35- $ 40 if you do n't order drinks or anything else).</li><li>I have had lobster at Red Lobster and it is n't comparable.</li><li>I have also had lobster in Maine and cooked the Lobster fresh from T &amp; T supermarket and by comparison, this place is very good.</li><li>Both lobster is huge!</li><li>The boiled version they mix the breadcrumb with herbs and butter and baked it wit the lobster.</li><li>The lobster is certainly fresh and not over cooked.</li><li>The lobster is very good, but small for $ 40.00.</li><li>The food was not presented nicely, and while the lobster seemed fresh, the taste was n't rich enough for the 1 1/2 broiled lobster ( $ 49).</li><li>Adding to what is becoming a bad dinner night, sauces for seafood and baked potato came in disposable ketchup cups that you see at McDonald 's; they said they ran out of those ' aprons' to cover your shirt when eating lobster; and they also happened to run out of lobster cutters as well.</li><li>When the waitress ( who seemed like the owner) took our orders of 4 appetizers and a 1 1/4 lobster, she was all like `` you 're in a group of 4, you need to order at least 2 entrees''.</li><li>The irony of my family going out for un-kosher lobster on a Jewish holiday is certainly not lost on me.</li><li>Soup was great- Lobster was splendid ( no sure if that was 2 1/2 pounds).</li><li>Had lots of chunks of lobster, so much flavor, and so, so creamy, probably made with a bazillion calories of real butter and cream.</li><li>She gave us extra lobster, extra lobster bisque, extra salads, extra dessert at the end.</li><li>My girlfriend loved the lobster.</li><li>The lobster is beautifully cooked- scrumptious, moist.</li><li>However, if you know this is what to expect, the lobster is worth these downers.</li><li>THE BOTTOM LINE: know you 're not going to a white tablecloth place, but be rest assured the lobster is delicious.</li><li>Best lobster I 've ever had.</li><li>That said, each of the times I 've gone, they 've delivered a perfectly cooked lobster to my table.</li><li>We order the lobster which was not spicy at all and very oily.</li><li>Lots of variety, always get lobster and chicken and duck congee which are both delicious.</li><li>Well, the lobster was succulent and perfectly poached in the congee.</li><li>The bowl is huge and could feed a lot of people for that 21.95,, but we ate up the lobster and about half the congee and called it done.</li><li>A little pricey, but this was a whole, LARGE lobster, and they had it cracked and separated making it so easy to get the meat out and enjoy.</li><li>We had a platter of tofu, cold pig ears, pork belly, veggies, Peking duck two ways ( wraps and lettuce), fried rice, and lobster.</li><li>We also ordered the lobster, house special fried rice and broccoli.</li><li>I get that duck and lobster can be pricey but for the overall quality of the food it felt like a total rip-off.</li><li>The crab and the lobster were fried in the same tasteless junk probably used to grease door hinges.</li><li>I love lobster and was worried about it tasting bad being uncooked, but i was quite impressed.</li><li>We are surprised to have lobster added to the Tepanyaki dinner.</li><li>We had booked the typical ten course meal of assorted BBQ meats, fried chicken, Peking duck, lettuce wrap with minced duck, seafood egg drop soup, lobster, fried fish, veggies, fried rice, fried noodles, and dessert.</li><li>Their dine-in menu includes appetizers, sushi &amp; sashimi, special rolls, live lobster, BBQ beef short ribs, curry, cutlets, grilled salmon, set course meals, teppanyaki dishes and so much more.</li><li>$ 19.95 for a half lobster, appetizers and a main with salad, soup etc.</li><li>It seems that the menu is geared towards impressing the Chinese palette for fresh seafood ( i.e. lobster, crab), which- as a herbivore- I ca n't say too much about.</li><li>The lobster was good though and there was plenty of it in the order!</li><li>The ginger flavor of the lobster meshed very well with the noodle, which sort of helped save the disappointing noodles.</li><li>The lobster was cooked just right.</li><li>The seafood are fairly fresh but Im not a fan of the drenched sauce and the lobster was covered with starchy and chewy greasy tempura bits which I always hate.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
