<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 90' %><h2>appetizers<br />occurrence: 84</h2><div><ol><li>They always start you off with free appetizers ( `` panchan'' in korean) which include: vegetable pancake, honey glazed potatoes, edamame soy beans, yam glass noodles, and kimchi.</li><li>I also love the appetizers they give.</li><li>It even bigger than before! its very impressive probably 200 items + and they had a good selection of not only desserts but set meals ( ie clay pot rices, and appetizers, and soups) The desserts are even better now, some are new like ice chow mein.</li><li>Although we came `` not hungry'', we each ordered a full entree plus 3 rolls, 3 appetizers, and a sashimi small to share.</li><li>Great appetizers and beautiful salads.</li><li>Overall, just a crappy experience. been here only few times and always for lunch. lunch options are very good and at least vegetarian options are pretty cheap ( tofu bento box + soup + salad = $ 7). the food is yummy! and they have some interesting appetizers like avocado tempura! which is just delicious! the staff is friendly and helpful.</li><li>We ordered mussels as appetizers, which were in tomato sauce and were good.</li><li>The appetizers are a little higher priced for the food, and we split the Thai Chicken Bites.</li><li>The food:- Banchan: the are very generous with the appetizers here, the little spicy cucumbers and japchae are my favorite 4/5- Beef bone soup: dumplings/ rice cake/ egg white drop in a milky beef bone broth soup 4/5- Dolsot bibimbap: so many toppings!</li><li>The food is delicious and it 's so conveniently located too:) Whenever we ask for seconds on the appetizers they 're happy to provide:) great customer service.</li><li>Food and appetizers taste awesome !!</li><li>Good appetizers, the cucumber was my favorite.</li><li>They are definitely one of the best appetizers ( the other contender being the Calamari).</li><li>I 've eaten here multiple times having either the pizzas, appetizers, salads, lunch sandwiches or entrees and they are all absolutely delicious!</li><li>For appetizers our table had: 2 French onion soups, seafood chowder, beet salad &amp; calamari.</li><li>The appetizers were the typical Korean appetizers, yet, they did n't provide kimchi for us -- we had to ask them for it.</li><li>It comes with salad and miso soup as appetizers, and a scoop of ice cream to end the meal ( I am not sure if they offer ice cream to everyone or just a big group).</li><li>Spring rolls and the rice sticky buns with shrimps are great appetizers.</li><li>Choose from the classic Pho, rice, vermicelli, soup, appetizers and beverages including the yummy fruit shakes.</li><li>They have a variety of other AYCE Sushi staples like Tempura items, Ramen and Noodle Soups, Salads, Rice dishes, and appetizers like Beef Enoki, Korean Short Ribs, Skewers, and cutlets.</li><li>Food: For appetizers, my colleagues and I ordered the Spring Rolls.</li><li>The toasted garlic bread and taramusilato was good, and the appetizers were passable.</li><li>My side plate from our appetizers was sitting in front of me and the waiter made no move to move my plate for my entree.</li><li>They have an extensive menu consisting of pizza 's, pastas, sandwiches, salads and appetizers.</li><li>The tofu dish among the little appetizers was the freshest I 've ever had at a restaurant.</li><li>Their appetizers are worth mentioning: delicious, some of the best kimchi I 've ever had in the city!</li><li>We had heard such great thing but was extremely disappointed. the appetizers were okay, but one of the parties ordered the soup and it was smaller than a tea cup.</li><li>They have share-able appetizers that are betel leaves that you turn into some taco-thing that are unique and delicious.</li><li>Some appetizers were very delicious but very pricey and each dish was n't enough to share with 3 others.</li><li>Cons:- Bad service- Small quantity- Pho was sub-par- Appetizers were overpriced for the amount I would say it was the first, and last time I will be at this restaurant.</li><li>It 's not the traditional `` thick'' tahina you may get some places ( it 's more of a watered-down liquid, in a squeeze bottle) but it 's still very tasty and in unlimited supply -- a group of 6 of us go through SEVERAL bottles of it when we 're there, putting it on everything -- the appetizers, the meat, the rice, everything.</li><li>When the waitress ( who seemed like the owner) took our orders of 4 appetizers and a 1 1/4 lobster, she was all like `` you 're in a group of 4, you need to order at least 2 entrees''.</li><li>For appetizers, they have mashed potatoes served like a scoop of ice cream and green seaweed seasoned with black pepper.</li><li>As usual, the appetizers did not come until nearly 20 minutes later.</li><li>They got their drinks and appetizers so quick and we waited there for 30 mins and nothing came to us.</li><li>Why could n't the waiter just serve both our tables the appetizers ?!</li><li>I myself have worked at a restaurant before and I would 've handled the situation differently and aplogized right away + bring out the appetizers.</li><li>We did n't get our appetizers until we asked them ( 30 minutes after we ordered) and it took about 40 minutes for us to get our food ... the place was n't even packed!</li><li>I love their appetizers ... so yummy.</li><li>We ordered 3 appetizers ( Tossed cucumber, Potato Jia-mo and Sliced Beef ( cold)) and 3 noodle dishes around 11:45.</li><li>At this point, we questioned the server why we were still missing 2 appetizers when this other table received both of theirs.</li><li>I understand this but make all 3 appetizers and send them out at the same time.</li><li>Do n't send one out and make the other people have to wait for their appetizers.</li><li>Time your cooking so that all 3 appetizers are ready at the same time.</li><li>So after waiting 35 minutes, we had only received one of our 3 appetizers and none of our main courses.</li><li>We asked if they could split the appetizers into quarters and they said they could n't because of the way it was made.</li><li>Their service is good and you always get many free yummy appetizers!</li><li>It came with few appetizers including the pickled radishes and the buttered corn which were great to start with.</li><li>We ordered a whole array of chicken, and fries and before that arrived we had complimentary appetizers.</li><li>Like all Korean establishments, there 's always the free appetizers beforehand, and did I mention their fried chicken dish is amazing !?</li><li>They have great appetizers and fried chicken.</li><li>As for the appetizers, the lettuce salad was average, but I enjoyed the coleslaw and the cubes of pickled something ( not sure what it was).</li><li>I always fill up on the appetizers, which include caviar, smoked salmon, shrimp cocktail, crab salad, ceasar salad, and on and on.</li><li>The food was good but I 'd agree that the appetizers were better than the mains, although I did n't eat many mains because I was full of the early dishes.</li><li>This restaurant offers a large menu with tons of sushi, great appetizers and various bento box options.</li><li>The price point is amazing for super yummy soups and great free appetizers!</li><li>The server hands you a few order sheets, and you mark down the quantity of each item desired, whether it 's sushi, appetizers, soups, noodles, hot dishes, etc., and they make everything to order.</li><li>This was nice as it let me try a variety of different dishes and appetizers.</li><li>We always order wings, calamari, beer, appetizers and deserts.</li><li>We were pleasant, waited patiently for everything, even ate our order of wings anticipating that our appetizers were going to be coming soon!</li><li>Long list of unique hot and cold drinks, deserts and appetizers.</li><li>I was out with the girls for a late night chirp-fest, and thus iced coffees and appetizers were on our agenda.</li><li>Also the complementary appetizers that are typical of these type of restaurants ... my mum is always asking if we can go eat here because she craves them.</li><li>Those `` safe'' items + the appetizers are a great introduction.</li><li>Ban chan ( korean `` appetizers''): Good variety, all were excellent.</li><li>I 've been here more than 15 times and each time we have to ask multiple times for things like hot sauce, more tea, more appetizers because the first waitress would forget/ignore our order- even at non busy times like 4.30pm.</li><li>The appetizers are a good selection and it is really nice of them to give us refills.</li><li>My favorite part about this place is the appetizers.</li><li>Pros: bottomless appetizers, gyoza ( TO DIE FOR), fast service ( although not the friendliest), bibimbap!</li><li>The service and appetizers are the redeeming factor.</li><li>Sure, the restaurant was clean and shiny, the appetizers ( fried eggplant in tomato sauce and baba ghanoush) were excellent as always, and the pita bread baked on site was nearly perfect.</li><li>The dips, bread, and appetizers here are jaw dropping: kashkeh bademjan, bademjan kebob, maust borani ..</li><li>No one wanted the cake since we were already full from the free appetizers and entrees.</li><li>Wait, there 's more, they charged us for the appetizers, I inquired and he said `` the bread was complimentary, not the appetizers''.</li><li>A number of snacks and appetizers are also available, and they have cups of ( what I assume is) fresh soy milk available for purchase.</li><li>We were there to celebrate a birthday so my dad ordered various appetizers including beef sashimi ( tender and juicy, equivalent to eating beef tartare), a sushi boat ( featuring fresh spicy tuna maki, hamachi, toro, maguro, squid with salmon roe, and raw shrimp- good to order so that everyone at the table can sample different sushi and sashimi), the usual vegetables ( aka tempura), and blue tuna spicy and California hand rolls.</li><li>The selection of appetizers was just enough to let everyone at the table have a small main course.</li><li>Let 's start with the appetizers,- Gyoza dumplings, shrimp tempura is pretty good nothing special.</li><li>Our four course meal consisted of cold and warm appetizers, followed by a fish and meat course.</li><li>Their dine-in menu includes appetizers, sushi &amp; sashimi, special rolls, live lobster, BBQ beef short ribs, curry, cutlets, grilled salmon, set course meals, teppanyaki dishes and so much more.</li><li>$ 19.95 for a half lobster, appetizers and a main with salad, soup etc.</li><li>Our appetizers were escargots and Caesar salad.</li><li>The appetizers are done well, and they 're honestly mainly meant as something to sustain your stomach as you chat a bit and decide on your food choices.</li><li>Find something else. went there with a friend for lunch, it was buffet. the place was quite small but with a lot of places to sit! they have large tables too! the service was great, fast and friendly people. the buffet include: one soup 2 or 3 salad options many dips and sauces 1 rice 3-4 kind of vegetable dishes 5-6 meat dishes ( include chicken, lamb, beef, shrimps) they also have bread ( nan) and appetizers ( could not remember the names) they also have desserts ( 2 kinds) and fruits the taste was very good and not too spicy, however they have really extreme spicy sauces! the price was around 10 dollars as a neighborhood restaurant it one of the best options in the area and for sure I 'll be back:).</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
