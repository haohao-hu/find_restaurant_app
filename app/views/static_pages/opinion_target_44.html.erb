as the others review says, its amazing. so im not going to be talking about how great the pho is cause everyone else is already doing that. the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that sometimes i could taste the detergent they used while wiping or cleaning the bowls spoons or chopsticks with. it throws off the taste but i usually either just switch utensil and itll be fine or ill cleanit down with tea:).</li><li>Pho Dau Bo Finch, thanks for 11 years of great pho!

Sometimes the base is flavourful and other times it is water-downed.</li><li>I have n't tried any of the other food here but going by the pho I do n't think it should be too long.</li><li>Hands down the most authentic Vietnamese food in the GTA, very delicious Pho, vermicelli, and rice dishes.</li><li>The pho was pretty decent and it came out in less than 5 minutes.</li><li>We had three orders of medium pho ( huge!) and one order of squid in black bean sauce.</li><li>I 'm really picky when it comes to pho, but I think this pho is one of the best ones I 've had so far.</li><li>The Pho is very decent and lots of great variety of Vietnamese Cusine.</li><li>I always getting the Pho rare beef and brisket which comes with plentiful meat and noodle, you can also definitely tell they 've stewed the soup base at least for a night or so.</li><li>I went two more times after my first visit and the quality of food has deteriorated a bit, the pho now tastes ok and also other dishes are ok.</li><li>Great pho.</li><li>An unassuming spot for excellent pho.</li><li>I could overlook the service and give it a higher rating, but the pho was n't good.</li><li>He was upset that there were noodles in his pho ( pho = noodle soup, right ?) the first time it came out.</li><li>The soup broth in their pho tastes really good.</li><li>There are nicer pho restaurants around the GTA but this restaurant has the best pho in town.</li><li>You can get decent pho at many restaurants, but it 's the other Viet dishes that are amazing at this place.</li><li>Stay away from this dish and stick to their pho and com tam instead.</li><li>Best pho in town!</li><li>It 's been a while, but I have finally found a restaurant in the GTA that has good pho.</li><li>The pho here is actually comparable to something you would get in Southern California.</li><li>Over the years, I 've had quite a few items from their menu, ranging from their pho to their rice/meat combos, and I can vouch for all of them.</li><li>They did this with all employees, so customers beware! portions here are really generous. the workers and waitresses are also really nice. for the people who are complaining about how the workers are ( ie rolliing the dirty dishes around etc) ... thats typically a normal vietnamese resturant for you. if u think this is dirty then u should not go to vietnam lol. but anywho, food here is really good. my parents go here every other day or so cos its close to their work and i also know a friend who eats here everyday too just cause he loves it. the pho, rice, and bun mam is really yummy. also my aunt is obssessed with their viet coffee as she says its authentic since there is so much flavour! also really cheap too:) oh yeah its cash only ... i think by now its safe to say if u go anywhere asian, just have cash with u cos chances are they are not going to take debit or credit!</li><li>I always get the pho tai bo vien and the pho is just so delicious!</li><li>Best pho ever !!!</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
