<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 763' %><h2>dynamite<br />occurrence: 5</h2><div><ol><li>Ordered the dynamite, rainbow &amp; hard rock and enjoyed every last bite!</li><li>Deducting one star as sometimes I do n't want to have to eat it in the car before a movie at Empress Walk ... more than 3 seats would be nice! korean-run close to yonge-finch. they 're very quick, and the portions are huge and quite tasty- especially the dynamite roll. the fish is n't always that fresh and not seasoned properly, so i 'd avoid the sushi/sashimi and stick with the rolls. but very good value. my main criticism is the owner 's wife- sometimes she yells uncontrollably and it 's not clear who she 's yelling at- the customer or the sushi chefs or perhaps she needs psychological evaluation.</li><li>My usual order consists of mostly cooked rolls such as Dynamite, Spider and sometimes the Spicy tuna or Salmon Roll.</li><li>This is only the third time I visited this place but she already remember that I really love their dynamite;) I was sold after reading reviews based on serving size, and the Bong did n't disappoint.</li><li>The dynamite was ENORMOUS so I was filled very quickly and it was so good.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
