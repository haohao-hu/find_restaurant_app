<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 209' %><h2>reservation<br />occurrence: 30</h2><div><ol><li>Also a reservation.</li><li>As we walked in Louise screamed `` You need a reservation,'' which we had but I think she was intimidated because we looked too upscale for the place.</li><li>Just make sure that if you plan to go at a peak time, make a reservation.</li><li>The place gets packed with regulars so suggest coming early or making a reservation.</li><li>We made a reservation, expecting that most places are going to be crowded on Saturday evening.</li><li>What 's the point of booking a reservation a month ahead when I ca n't even get a decent table to celebrate a significant occasion ??</li><li>Weekdays are not that busy but weekends, you may need a reservation.</li><li>White table cloths on all the tables, and it seemed most tables had a reservation note taped on.</li><li>This place is always busy so make sure you either come early or get a reservation.</li><li>The people who reserved never got their seats on time and people who were waiting in line got their seats taken by those reservation.</li><li>We had a large party and had to wait a while even with a reservation, unfortunately.</li><li>Fortunately we had a reservation.</li><li>We went during lunch, had a reservation and all was well so far.</li><li>A man, whom I 'm guessing was the manager quickly walked me back to the front desk and asked if I had a reservation.</li><li>Once he confirmed that I had a reservation he proceeded to show me to my seat; i commented that my friend was running late, but then he asked if my friend was female- I found this to be a very weird question!</li><li>We did n't have a reservation, which I get is an issue with such a large group but it was a Wednesday night post Xmas.</li><li>We had made a reservation because we purchased a deal but it was n't necessary, there were only a couple of tables occupied.</li><li>In those cases ( or if you 're a large party), make a reservation.</li><li>It started getting quite busy around 6:30pm so I suggest making the reservation earlier -- like 5pm.</li><li>We UYE 'd it:) The place was packed, but thank golly gee I made a reservation!</li><li>Many tips said to book a reservation.</li><li>Sure enough, when we got there on a snowy evening, our reservation was right in front of her, on a yellow sticky note.</li><li>It gets busy on weekend evenings, so either make a reservation or prepare to wait a bit.</li><li>The place is a little small and was starting to fill up when we were leaving so going early/ making a reservation might be an idea here.</li><li>Being a regular we forgave the 10 minute delay to be seated with our reservation and the lack of tea service.</li><li>My only gripe is that even with a reservation we had to wait a while to be seated.</li><li>Make sure you have a reservation, and come 10 minutes prior to your requested time so you get a table a.s.a.p as this place is often crowded around the dinner time rush.</li><li>I have to quantify my review by saying that my visit was on Mother 's Day, however, it seems the wait times with a reservation are poorly managed.</li><li>It was fairly busy but I did not need a reservation, I walked right in.</li><li>It 's a very small restaurant, so expect to wait even with a reservation.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
