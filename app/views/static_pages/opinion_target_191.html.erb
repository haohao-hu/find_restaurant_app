<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 191' %><h2>entree<br />occurrence: 33</h2><div><ol><li>All you can eat SALAD BAR ( which I had never heard of before) which you got for free when you order an entree.</li><li>While the salad did n't fail my expectations ( phew!), my entree ( New Mexico Chicken) was dry, really dry.</li><li>But c 'mon- 5 beers AND an entree ?</li><li>Main entree course ( sushi and sashimi) was prepared in advance and left to sit on top of the cooler, as opposed to inside of it.</li><li>Veal Piccata- $ 18.95 My friend 's entree was not much of a looker, but he enjoyed the tenderness of the veal.</li><li>Overall though the rice and the entree were on the savoury side.</li><li>But not offering a free coffee or a discount on the entree.</li><li>We both highly recommend the soups.:) The next great feature is the menu is equipped with little GF logos throughout to make it easier for gluten intolerant people to select an entree.</li><li>The entree 's were good, but not execeptional.</li><li>Great great restaurant ... have been going here for years ... under a different owner ... never the less I continued to get the same amazing service ... staff us very attentive ... must try everyone is the portobello mushroom salad ... for our main entree we always ended making our dish picking from different entrees ... wat I do miss is a grilled jumbo tiger shrimp the previous owner used to make me .... he said it was my special thing .... and mayb an addition of a triple chocolate cake/cheese cake .... it wud make a difference in the desert ... it did enjoyed today 's tirimisu.</li><li>I came here for a friend 's birthday, so we already had a somewhat fixed menu ( you could choose between 2 or 3 options for the entree).</li><li>My preference is to order an entree outside of the lunch special menu so that it 's prepared hot and fresh.</li><li>The entree I ordered was the mackerel.</li><li>Food is good but not fabulous for the price per entree.</li><li>I forgot to ask and ordered a creamy entree.</li><li>The entree was alright.</li><li>As for the food, my party usually orders the large caesar salad, deluxe pizza, and choice of pasta as an entree.</li><li>However- their entree 's were fairly moderately priced.</li><li>For the entree I ordered the smoked duck breast with quinoa.</li><li>For our entree we both got the Crispy Beef Panang Curry and honestly this was the star of the show.</li><li>We only had an hour for lunch and had to leave sooner than we liked and told the waiter this and asked for the entree and dessert together.</li><li>The manager came by to tell us because of a printing problem and that is why our remaining items were delayed, but he arranged it so that we 'd get our entree soon and the dessert would be to go.</li><li>Anyways, fine, we decided to change our order and get lobster grandin ( appetizer $ 12), garlic jumbo shrimp ( entree $ 32), and 1 1/4 steamed lobster ( entree $ 36) for now to see how the food is then get more later if we like the foods ( yes we were that scared).</li><li>At a lot of Korean restaurants where you do your own table top cooking, or share an entree, especially those that say they 're for two people, there 's usually a lot of food ( like enough to feed 3 hungry people or 4 average/small eaters).</li><li>Normally at Korean restaurants, the rice comes out with the entree.</li><li>For the entree, my pork loin is very tender.</li><li>For my entree, I ordered the filet mignon medium rare, and it was cooked to perfection.</li><li>I declined but the guy was like, `` come on, you 're getting a free entree, you may as well get a soup!''</li><li>However, the blueberry glaze was overly saccharine and as much as I love sugar, like, no. My mom 's entree was great though, and it was around $ 20.</li><li>The entire meal ( 1 entree plus 1 soup cause of the deal) came to over $ 50 plus tip.</li><li>Next comes garlic bread which was delicious and very garlicky, next were salads which was a bunch of iceberg lettuce and a single slice of tomato, and finally was the entree, served with a choice of potato.</li><li>Their lunch specials range from $ 12-14 and include choice of soup or salad, an entree ( fish/pork tenderloin/ox tail/spaghetti), tea/coffee/hk milk tea, and a slice of cake.</li><li>The food was average, but the three course meal ( soup, entree and dessert) for like $ 15 is like a super deal, while everywhere else around the city is like price gouging over the same holiday.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
