<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 855' %><h2>strawberry<br />occurrence: 4</h2><div><ol><li>The mango was also pretty good, however the strawberry was better balance in the desert. and the waffle had a good presentation value. the only thing about the waffle is that its definitely not what they show you on the menu, on the menu they advertise the oreo waffle as a waffle infused with oreo and chocolate flavour, with vanilla ice cream on it.</li><li>Or rather, the strawberry was this wave of colour in the slice ... yeah, it was good, but we were disappointed.</li><li>The fruits were n't the freshest either- the pineapple was super sour and hard, the strawberry was soggy &amp; the grapes looked unwashed.</li><li>On a good day, they 'll have the strawberry, mango or blueberry meringue cakes available.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
