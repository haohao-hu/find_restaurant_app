<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1964' %><h2>chicken wing skewers<br />occurrence: 2</h2><div><ol><li>The food is good and there are a lot of good points and must tries to this AYCE:- scallop sashimi ( it was quite delicious and fresh)- beef tataki ( although I was n't a fan of it)- gui ling gao ( in the dessert menu- not something I 've seen at other AYCE places)- takoyaki tastes really good ( the flavour is on point!)- grilled squid ( reminded me of night markets, it was very tasty, was n't too chewy at all)- grilled eggplant ( there 's a sweet sauce and it is grilled nicely)- chicken wing skewers ( they 're so good!, the wings are skewed on so the bones are pushed down)- pop is included in the menu ( so no extra charge for all you pop lovers!).</li><li>I tried chicken wing skewers.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
