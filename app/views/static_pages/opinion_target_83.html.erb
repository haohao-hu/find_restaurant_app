<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 83' %><h2>duck<br />occurrence: 72</h2><div><ol><li>Rather than the usual ground/shredded duck to be scooped into lettuce wraps, we had a mountain of ground/shredded quail.</li><li>I took a bite of the duck breast, which to me is the best part of the duck because it 's the meatiest, and I immediately noticed a very moist and tender texture.</li><li>The duck was also lean enough that I was n't biting into fat most of the time.</li><li>It 's kinda similar to Peking duck, but the duck is actually deep fried.</li><li>Pros Nice location Ambiance is good Service is fast Friendly staff Good presentation Red curry was on par Cons Dinner for two $ 74 Duck was smoked and dry, gummy Lamb was as dry as it can get I still LOVE the crispy duck!</li><li>The duck was cooked perfectly, nice and simply, full of juicy flavour, as was the curry.</li><li>Seated quickly; the waitress was attentive and easily flagged ( is n't it the most frustrating thing when it seems like all the waiters in a restaurant are giving you the silent treatment ?), and the waitress also `` forks'' the duck off the bone for the crispy duck pancakes entree, which was incredible to watch.</li><li>We asked for more lettuce wrap for our duck which she happily provided us with.</li><li>Had the crispy duck ( as recommended get the two legs for 3 bucks more, as suggested by the server.</li><li>The flavour of the duck was rich and fragrant, but it overpowered the entire dish and the plate seemed a bit over priced.</li><li>Despite other positive aspects, this made us DESPISE the restaurant: The duck came w/ 6 tiny moo shu `` tortillas'' ( not steamed buns like described).</li><li>For mains we had beef short rib with coconut chilli, Islamic noodle, duck in red curry and salmon in Tom yum sauce.</li><li>The duck was crispy on the outside and tender inside.</li><li>My friend ordered the crispy duck which was very good!</li><li>It is difficult to take seriously a hole in the wall Chinese BBQ with such a ridiculously sounding title ... that is until you tried the duck.</li><li>Okay, it 's not Peking Duck quality, and the birds are not serialized from birth to keep track of quality, and there are certainly no time wasted on decorum, but for a local BBQ place where one can purchase a duck, half a duck, chicken, BBQ pork, duck liver, sausages, tofu, and a simple rice takeaway, there are no competition within a 3km radius.</li><li>In addition to the roasted pork, duck, soya sauce chicken and BBQ pork they also have the various cooked intestines, soya sauce chicken leg, chicken wings, the squid, some sort of sausage, salted free run chicken and a lot of other items.</li><li>Anyways, it does n't matter as I 'm sure you 'll find this one will do just fine.:) P.S. Closed Wednesday great quality and price. the people are really nice. get the duck and chicken those are the best. the soup is amazing too and vegatibles taste really good.</li><li>Dishes are hit and miss. The duck and preserved vegetable fried noodle was a big disappointment though.</li><li>It 's most important for me is that they have Hongkong milk tea and the tofu and duck here are also tasteful Ok food.</li><li>We like to order the lettuce wrap second course for the duck.</li><li>The duck plus the beef dish is generally enough to stuff the three us to the gills and barely able to walk.</li><li>Ordered the peking duck 2-course special and it was amazing, the duck was cooked perfectly, the skin was crispy, the meat was tender with just the right amount of fat.</li><li>Just enjoy the duck and do n't spend too much time looking around at the decor.</li><li>The duck was not carved at the table to my disappointment ..</li><li>The skin on the duck was crispy and delicious.</li><li>We first started off with 4 of the duck.</li><li>It was kinda creepy because four waiters and waitresses surrounded our table with the duck and started cutting it up.</li><li>The duck is really good with the pancake things and a little bit of cucumber and sauce.</li><li>The food is not impressive. the duck is supposed to be their specialty however it is bland when compared to other restaurants.</li><li>Our duck was skinny when it was presented to us before serving so we were a little disappointed.</li><li>The duck took about 20 minutes and that was fine.</li><li>The wrap for the duck was good but the cucumber and onion looked like it was prepped days ago and just kept in the fridge.</li><li>There is always at least 5-6 ducks being served every time I have been here, I have not tried the duck but it is craved at your table and in thin slices, always interesting to watch.</li><li>Thou, you wo n't be disappointed if you do go for duck!</li><li>The duck is quite fatty.</li><li>The duck was somewhat of a saving grace.</li><li>The atmosphere can definitely use a face lift, but the duck is worth the wait!</li><li>I would imagine the look of the place would turn away people that were n't recommended to go there for the duck.</li><li>The duck was good and food itself was fine.</li><li>And then they take what 's left of the duck and turn it into the ' second course' serving of duck scraps, which you can have in a variety of ways, most of which costs extra $ $ $.</li><li>Not enough egg roll pancakes served with the duck.</li><li>Even the Peking duck they are supposedly known for is mediocre.</li><li>The Peking duck set course is also a great deal, around $ 40 for 2 courses depending how you get the second course ( the remainder of the duck) prepared.</li><li>Everything we ordered was delicious from the peking duck to the vegetables to the lemon chicken.</li><li>There were four of us, some Chinese and non- Chinese We ordered ONE two course Whole BBQ duck ( presented and carved duck in very thin slices at the table, comes with crepes ( ?) and stir fried duck meat with lettuce) FYI: you make a wrap, sliced duck with crepe or stir fried duck with lettuce, One Chinese style chow mein One shrimp fried rice One Chinese broccoli with garlic sauce And tea The hostess informed us it will take 20 mintues for the duck.</li><li>Duck with crepes, actually duck was not bad but cold, crepes were cold and dry.</li><li>We 're vegetarians so ca n't comment on the duck and such.</li><li>Their duck was crispy, and with only one duck, it used to feed a family of 4 comfortably.</li><li>And like I said, the duck is so tiny.</li><li>The duck was so good.</li><li>The crepe portion was a little small but ey, whatever, you 're here for the duck.</li><li>But if you 're just looking to have some good Chinese food and awesome duck, then this is the place.</li><li>The duck, however, was probably the driest, blandest Peking duck I 've ever eaten.</li><li>I 'd rather have a good duck that good crepes.</li><li>I know you see the table next to you having some stir fry vegetables or general tao chicken, but trust me, do n't stray from the duck!</li><li>The duck!</li><li>In terms of taste, the duck was crispy and decent. it didnt have much flavour on its own, so you have to rely on the sauce provided to give it flavour. after you eat the skin, there are multiple options on how you want to eat the rest of the duck meat, you can serve it with garlic sauce or you can add more $ $ to eat it diced with lettuce or other options available.</li><li>I would not recommend the option with the garlic sauce which is additional $ 2, bcuz it was simply chopping up the duck with some sauce on top, this method was hard to eat bcuz there was barely any meat left on the duck, so you would be spending most of your time nibbling on bones lol but i wasnt very willing to spend an additional $ 7 to have them debone the duck and give me a few pieces of lettuce either lol $ 36 for a 2 course Peking Duck dinner.</li><li>I ate this more than I had the duck!</li><li>The Peking Duck wasokay- the usual side dishes and garnishes were missing but the duck was well roasted.</li><li>Like eve the duck was really bland.</li><li>Their Peking duck is $ 30 and it includes only first course with a limit of 12 pancakes, the duck itself is rather fatty for my liking and their sauce is too concentrated.</li><li>- Peking Duck ( $ 39.99): not my #1 spot for peking duck, but it 's pretty good and the duck is leaner than other places if you 're health conscious- Braised Beef Noodle Soup ( $ 9.95): I have yet to find a place in Toronto that does this better than Asian Legend.</li><li>We had booked the typical ten course meal of assorted BBQ meats, fried chicken, Peking duck, lettuce wrap with minced duck, seafood egg drop soup, lobster, fried fish, veggies, fried rice, fried noodles, and dessert.</li><li>The duck came first and it looks absolutely delicious.</li><li>My wife said the duck was crispy, deboned and the orange sauce really complimented the duck; well balanced, not too too sweet.</li><li>My duck was the highlight of the meal ( oh so tender and juicy), but my dad 's version was tough and not great.</li><li>The absolutely fantastic 16oz rib steak was the only dish that showed the kitchen 's potential, and was much better then the sirloin Steak, over cooked lobster, or disappointing duck.</li><li>Also, duck was chewy.</li><li>I 've had duck many times.</li><li>The congee here is first rate, especially the pork and preserved duck egg and the duck and chicken.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
