<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 242' %><h2>beef noodle soup<br />occurrence: 24</h2><div><ol><li>I especially love their beef noodle soup, stewed pork w/ rice, and fried milk dessert!</li><li>Oh, and beef noodle soup is n't really a szechuan specialty; I really would n't order it here.</li><li>Ordered the cold noodle appetizer ( shown in pictures here), beef noodle soup ( lunch special), fried rice ( lunch special), mushroom and cucumber cold appetizer ( to balance out the heat from the the cold noodle appetizer).</li><li>When I come here i usually order the Pho Dac Biet which is the special famous beef noodle soup that comes with everything.</li><li>Special beef noodle soup is always my go to- you can even drink the beef broth.</li><li>This restaurant serves a variety of Vietnamese dishes including pho and rice and pork chops but their signature dish is Bun Bo Hue which is a spicy beef noodle soup.</li><li>Every Lamb and Beef dish on this picture friendly menu is AWESOME. go in for a warm lamb stew or chef 's special soup in the winter, or cool garlic cucumbers in the summer. their beef or lamb chinese style pancakes are YUM -- delightfully puffy and filled with perfectly seasoned meat. their house special beef noodle soup is cravable! you can taste the time and love in the soup base. ughh so goooood .. and the hand pulled noodles are as real as they get outside of la chine. seriously ? who cooks like this anymore outside of china ? -- these are classic techniques! the decor is kind of hilarious though, a lil step up from a hole in the wall, it 's definitely clean, but it also feels like you 're in the middle of nowhere china, really really first gen. like you 've escaped the city. and nothing matches. the walls are cheerily painted like you 're walking into the plateaus deep into china, starkly contrasting the leather booths and the crazy yellow seat covers that match the trilingual waitress 's outfits ( they mainly speak mandarin, some canto, and english). the TVs are always playing old 50 's chinese black &amp; white talkies, and there are neon signs boasting great halel food! the chef is usually out and about greeting the customers- he 's won awards for his food, and i agree -- this place is seriously the best regional lamb and beef dishes that 's hit the east side of this city since ... johnny 's burgers. i highly recommend this place! because i 'd be so sad to see it go under because no one knows about it. deserves my YUM YUM approval fo sheezie;).</li><li>We ordered bean sprouts, hand made beef noodle soup, spicy beef lung, sizzling beef and veggies as well as lamb skewers.</li><li>Try the snacks like squid balls, thick toast with condensed milk, or try the meals like beef noodle soup.</li><li>Pros: huge bowls ( beef noodle soup $ 9.99, cold noodles $ 6.99- medium size but filling), handmade noodles in North York, a good size menu Cons: tiny shop ( has 4 2-person seats and bar stools for 5-ppl, even though it 's handmade it 's not as chewy as I 'd like I like this place because it 's not easy to find handmade Chinese noodles in the Yonge/finch-to-Shep area.</li><li>I ordered the original beef noodle soup and soon realised it was not hand pulled when I got it.</li><li>I also tried their original beef noodle soup on a second visit and only the soup base was above average.</li><li>We ordered the spicy beef noodle soup and the soy beef noodle soup.</li><li>I 've also had their beef noodle soup.</li><li>The standard noodles in their beef noodle soup tasted very processed so I would definitely pay the extra $ 1 for hand-pulled noodles.</li><li>Some popular items on the menu such as shanghai soup dumplings, beef noodle soup are much better at other restaurants.</li><li>I like their soup dumplings ( xiao long bao), their beef noodle soup, sauteed green beans and fish fillet with wine essence.</li><li>Most recommended dish will be obviously their pho dac biet ( special famous beef noodle soup) with all the works including thinly sliced beef, beef balls, beef shank, beef tendon ( mmm my favourite!) and noodle with lots of bean sprouts and mint.</li><li>Be sure to try the Peking Duck, Deep Fried Tofu, Beef Noodle Soup, Dong Po pork, and Crystal Pork Aspic.</li><li>- Peking Duck ( $ 39.99): not my #1 spot for peking duck, but it 's pretty good and the duck is leaner than other places if you 're health conscious- Braised Beef Noodle Soup ( $ 9.95): I have yet to find a place in Toronto that does this better than Asian Legend.</li><li>That 's quite a bit for a bowl of beef noodle soup.</li><li>We ordered the seafood congee with a plate of fried dough sticks, a beef noodle soup, turnip cakes, and seafood fried rice.</li><li>Even with the three of us, we barely finished the congee, dough sticks and beef noodle soup.</li><li>Even cold and a few days old they were delicious:) We will definately be coming back and ordering the same thing again ( maybe minus the beef noodle soup so we can enjoy more of the delicious fried rice: Q)!</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
