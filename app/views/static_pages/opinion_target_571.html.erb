<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 571' %><h2>diner<br />occurrence: 6</h2><div><ol><li>The diner is open 24/7 and despite the presence of some oddball customers if you visit in the middle of the night, you can always be sure you are greeted by people who appreciate your business, and that you 'll be having probably the best late night grub anywhere north of Bloor St. At just under $ 5, the shawarma served in Greek style pita bread is full of flavour and fresh toppings.</li><li>It 's a low/key, not fancy diner with excellent service, reasonable prices and delicious food.</li><li>Could there really be a solid diner opening up with a good all day breakfast ?</li><li>Nice small diner and the omelette I had was delicious and great.</li><li>Our food came super fast, mainly I think because the diner was closing.</li><li>Varied menu in a nice, diner environment but they are very much focused on the regular customers at the price of the occasional visitor.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
