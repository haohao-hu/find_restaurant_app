<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1001' %><h2>fruit smoothies<br />occurrence: 3</h2><div><ol><li>The fruit smoothies are pretty refreshing on a hot day ( I 'd recommend the carrot/orange).</li><li>Getting fresh veggies and fruits from Berries &amp; Blooms became a twice a week habit during my last two semesters at York U. I used to frequent the old sandwich/salad/frozen yogurt place that used to be beside BMO because they had affordable salads and fruit smoothies, so I was pretty upset when they closed down during the York Lanes renovation.</li><li>Plus they get agitated so easily and then start talking crap about u in Hebrew ( blonde and red hair lady) and they did not guess that I 'm fully aware of what they are saying! fourth: unhygienic their fruit smoothies are fresh and they are real fruits ( not powder like the Asian shop across) especially in the case of watermelon/lychee smoothie .Their salads are not bad at all and you gotta weigh it accurately because if you do n't choose wisely your bill will be higher than expected!</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
