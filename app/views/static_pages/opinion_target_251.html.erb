<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 251' %><h2>fruit<br />occurrence: 18</h2><div><ol><li>The fruit was really fresh, and the coffee is bottomless !!</li><li>We 've gone a handful of times and we ALWAYS get really sad fruit ( some with rot spots) on the saddest piece of lettuce ever ( wilted and gross).</li><li>I order the seventh of July, but I asked for the fruit to be placed on the side.</li><li>I ordered the Cora Special ( $ 10.95) which consists of 2 eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, house potatoes, toast, fresh fruit and a crepe.</li><li>It had lots of fruit, mango jelly, and the super creamy ice cream on top really pulled everything together.</li><li>The fruit is a nice side to tone down the richness of the dish.</li><li>They do n't bother to keep it clean after a long day where there is salad spilling over everywhere either and sometimes their fruit looks dirty.</li><li>They use a really good chunk of real fruits in their smoothies so you can actually taste the fruit.</li><li>They gave nice fresh fruit in my lunch special.</li><li>I 've only eaten in at Pickle Barrel twice, once for their early bird breakfast ( 9-10:30am special, $ 4.99 generous ( at least I think so) continental breakfast with toast, eggs, breakfast meat &amp; fruit) and recently for brunch.</li><li>I was in the area after an interview and trying to decide what to eat ... ( Jeopardy Theme) Suddenly, I had a memory of home, mom making crepes and us kids, drizzling, spreading, sprinkling, packing them with sweet syrup, chocolate chips, icing sugar, fruit, whip topping.</li><li>I got a waffle and it was n't great because the fruit was not completely defrosted.</li><li>This is the only location who has ever asked me if I wanted the fruit or tomato garnish with my Jo construction, I was very impressed because other Cora 's never give me that option and NEVER have the piece of lettuce.</li><li>Their menu is extensive and one has the choice of choosing from their many options ( e.g. fruit, omelettes, crÃªpes, eggs, etc.)</li><li>Fresh fruit what more can you ask for.</li><li>The desserts are ok, but the fruit, chocolate fountain and shaved ice machine are all good, and I 'd suggest you put your emphasis on those.</li><li>There 's also a Chinese style buffet with familiar dishes, fresh fruit, jello, dim sum, dessert squares, a chocolate fountain and ice cream.</li><li>Chocolate dressing for fruit is also fun for kids.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
