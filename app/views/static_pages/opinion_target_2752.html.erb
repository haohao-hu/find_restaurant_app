<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 2752' %><h2>broth. chicken<br />occurrence: 1</h2><div><ol><li>It came out a lot faster than i thought it would! i read in other comments of wishing for a bigger menu, but if they are specializing, the argument is better quality control on what they make. there were six side dishes served with the bubbling hot soup. the chicken had glutinous rice, one piece of fresh ginseng that was full of flavour if you eat it, and one red date. caution: the date has its seed, you could hurt yourself if you bite down too fast too hard on that date. there was also one chestnut ( peeled of course) as well inside the glutinous rice. the waitress left a container lined with a plastic bag -- where chicken bones, red date seed, etc can be discarded. she also added a small dish with noodles to add into the boiling broth. chicken was slide off the bone and the glutinous rice was perfect. the chestnut seemed a little underdone, but i really enjoyed the soup, some may find it a little bland -- there is salt ( might even be sea salt) and black pepper to their soup. i liked it as it was and finished it to the last drop. side dishes: cubes of daikon kimchi, salad of lettuce woth red cabbage with this black sesame dressing, sweet soy fried xubes of potato, sweet pickled julienned slivers of daikon and carrot, marinaded fish cake with green pepper and a cucumber/zucchini marinaded with gochujang and sesame seeds etc. definitely full with a warm belly from this meal. planning this winter to come again and try other things on the menu. especially other ginseng soup options!</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
