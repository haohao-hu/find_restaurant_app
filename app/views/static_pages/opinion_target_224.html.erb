<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 224' %><h2>vibe<br />occurrence: 27</h2><div><ol><li>Fresh seafood and great vibe!</li><li>Very upscale vibe.</li><li>The restaurant looks absolutely amazing, classy decor, trendy vibe and really friendly and helpful staff.</li><li>This place is big, has a cool mixed bar/sushi/asian layout with a buck of communal bat height tables, is hip but not overwhelmingly hipster ( or whatever the Canadian equivalent is), has very bright, sweet, professional servers and an authentic feel and vibe.</li><li>There is a great vibe in the place which consists of booths, community tables and a u-shaped sushi bar.</li><li>I love the understated vibe of both the food and the decor.</li><li>This place reallllly has a `` homey'' vibe ...</li><li>As for the rest, friendly enough service and nice civilized vibe but it 's just a bit overpriced for what you get in terms of food.</li><li>Also, every good restaurant has a great vibe, and La Traviata did n't disappoint there either.</li><li>The bar has a very friendly vibe ... a `` Cheers'' kinda feel.</li><li>AMBIANCE: PRO: Casual vibe.</li><li>This place has got a great home-y vibe and the service was great, but the soup itself was a little bland, and maybe that 's just be over accustomed to everything else being higher in salt/msg.</li><li>The vibe is a bit slow and old.</li><li>SERVICE: overall the service was great, atmosphere was friendly and had a rustic vibe.</li><li>It 's got a nice vibe.</li><li>The vibe is like that of Owl of Minerva.</li><li>The vibe and music did not suit the restaurant.</li><li>This is definitely a place I could return to with a larger group of girlfriends, oddly enough despite the romantic-y vibe.</li><li>I do n't even know what a German house is or looks like but it just gives me a vibe.</li><li>All of the food is delicious ... however ... the vibe and atmosphere of this place is oddly confusing.</li><li>At first, Symposium Caf√© gave off the '' coffee and tea '' vibe and then you dine in and their menu is like 50 lbs heavy.</li><li>Although Memphis Smoke House is likely not for everyone, it is a perfect cozy and local venue for my husband and I. Personally, I am on a continual quest to find a close place with just the right vibe, smell, and delicious frozen drinks ( in this case, 8-10 oz. strawberry margaritas).</li><li>I like that this location has a second floor with a different vibe.</li><li>I do n't think the staff were super friendly like you would see at a Jack Astors or Boston Pizza, but then again it 's an Asian restaurant that would n't have that kind of vibe anyways.</li><li>I 'm not sure if it less busy on Sundays, but I liked the calm vibe.</li><li>Super casual vibe, family-oriented, and most importantly, cheap!</li><li>The service here is a bit on the slow side- I think they are going for an unhurried vibe, but at times we had to call them over for routine things like keeping water topped up.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
