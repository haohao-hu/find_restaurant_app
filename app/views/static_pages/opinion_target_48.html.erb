<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 48' %><h2>bread<br />occurrence: 144</h2><div><ol><li>At the end when we got our bill, they had charged us $ 2 or close to that ( I do not remember the exact amt.) for the banana bread we took from the buffet.</li><li>I figured that at least a $ 14.99 salad bar would have more than cold salads, bread and a soup- my last experience with salad bars being Sizzler at age 8 of course.</li><li>It was okay but I think the bread at Haida was fresher last time I ate there.</li><li>The bolani ( fried flat bread with potato filling) was freshly fried and the pastry was crispy while the sliced pieces of potatoes were soft, but not mushy.</li><li>Most grocery staples available and always a large variety e.g. bread/hard bread, rice, oil ( not sure about milk, butter or cereal besides oatmeal).</li><li>----- Food: Moderate ----- Bread -- Gotta give credit for the bread, it was nicely done; crusty, thick and warm.</li><li>The sauce was a perfect complement to the bread, and the mussels were very fresh as promised by our server.</li><li>Oh, and the freshly-baked bread is downright dangerous to the appetite you 'll need ... so be careful ... but if you ask for a doggie-bag ( not for your Pug or Rottweiler but for yourself) they make a little basket out of tin foil so you can take your leftover meal home.</li><li>Also bread is awesome.</li><li>I like the bread to start but surprised it 's served with butter packets ..</li><li>We had the standard bread, balsamic and olive oil at the table along with a bottle of sparkling water.</li><li>Definitely recommendable if you 're in the area and are looking for greek food! good food but the price of my souvlaki was a little on the high side. i asked how much to take some of the bread home and they gave me some ridiculous price over $ 100. all in all, the food is on the good side, the wait and price is not.</li><li>In terms of what we ordered: Mussels- excellent Chicken souvlaki- great Prime rib- no good, dont order this Garlic bread- excellent Steak and shrimp fajitas- steak not so good, shrimp was excellent Seems like they are n't too good with their beef, but everything else was great.</li><li>Hashbrown was tasteless and the bread was stale, hoping it had n't expired.</li><li>They are generous with their bread.</li><li>For that you get sparsely sliced apples i think 4 in total, with a nice hearty bread and the stated cheese nicely melted.</li><li>The bread also tasted old and cheap.</li><li>The bread they serve with the hummus is SO delicious as well, great combination.</li><li>The prix fixe starts off with a Brunch Pastry Basket filled with mini croissants, quick bread and muffins.</li><li>The texture reminded me very much of a bread pudding and we both agreed we would 've liked to have seen a little more crème anglaise on the plate.</li><li>The food though is really good as I shared: Charcuterie Board ( $ 14)- cured &amp; smoked meats, house made pâté, mustards, pickles, and bread While I nibbled off from my friend 's: Calamari ( $ 14)- lemon mustard aïoli, chilies and Shrimp Cocktail ( $ 16) Service was not the greatness this time .... our waitress was a little cold but I was too busy having a great time with my fellow yelpers to notice.</li><li>Extra saucy for bread dipping just the way I like it.</li><li>Our waters were always filled and the bread was always on the table.</li><li>This place is fairly expensive for a tavern, definitely above average bar prices but when you have dinner you have to order the bread and butter for $ 3.5 where most nice restaurants at a similar price point just bring the bread over.</li><li>They have one sandwhich consisting of plain white bread, chicken and topped and swimming in gravy.</li><li>Second of all, the bread is cold.</li><li>A better option is to bring the bread in a plate, and maybe warmed up or toasted.</li><li>Will continue to go but I hope they change how they serve the bread ...</li><li>The complementary ( flat) bread was cold and tasted day old.</li><li>I just do n't understand how the patrons are not all fat after all the bread, butter, rice, kabob, baklava and so forth The food is OK and the price is good.</li><li>That did n't sound particularly appealing to me ( bread in water ?), but I was pretty sure she meant broth, because afterwards, she told me it was sort of like soup.</li><li>The server failed to bring bread to the table and the portions were much smaller than the other locations.</li><li>Hidden in a sketchy looking strip mall, next to a sushi restaurant that 's also pretty fabulous, is this small mom-and-pop Italian grocery store that sells fresh cheese, bread, deli meats &amp; Italian desserts, in addition to a small selection of imported goods.</li><li>There are a variety of other options including patties, goat curry, pork, and also a few varieties of bread ( raisin loaves are recommended), but if it 's your first time trekking to this spot, you ca n't go wrong with jerk chicken sandwich at just under $ 4.</li><li>The spice of the chicken, the creaminess of the coleslaw and the sweetness of the bread.</li><li>Been going here since they first opened their doors while I was attending highschool in the neighborhood- delicious jerk chicken w/coco bread- I always got it with the slaw!</li><li>Being a good ole Southern Boy from the States, i would throw cole slaw and meat between any kind of bread.</li><li>For positive, the fresh bread is warm and fluffy.</li><li>We got complimentary bread, I thought it was nice at first, but no sauce/hummus or whatsoever.</li><li>I would recommend you get the coleslaw and buttered bread.</li><li>My only complaints are the hours ( 8p.m. closing time is too early) and the bread is terrible ( it 's literally store bought Wonderbread).</li><li>It did come with bread and butter.</li><li>I will definitely be coming back here !!! arviderci Paolo see you soon! this is a really cute place close to my neighborhood, my boyf and i decided to come here after i read some good yelp reviews ( id seen the place before but never got around to actually trying it). the service was so friendly and he gave us 2 coffees for the price of one which was very sweet. i love the decor and music, its very old-timey. i ordered a chicken sandwich and he ordered an eggplant sandwich, which is vegetarian, and they were really good, my only gripe would be that the bread is a bit dry. otherwise its a really nice little place with reasonable prices Basilico is a bit of an odd place as it looks like just a normal house advertising Italian food, but it 's much more.</li><li>Stale bread, nasty, dirty looking oil + balsamic dispensers ...</li><li>Good for the fresh bread.</li><li>Overall, very impressed with the setup and it 's a great option for a quick relatively healthy fresh lunch! + good bread- pricey pricey pricey This cafe is located within the factory building.</li><li>Sandwiches are such comfort food and nothing beats having a sandwich on freshly baked bread, especially bread that has such great texture and flavour.</li><li>Even the paté and olives that came with the bread was really good.</li><li>I thought it was a bit too greasy for me ... but I was also pretty thrown off by the bread ..</li><li>My triple decker sandwich was made with bread that was very similar to wonder bread.</li><li>Not sure if the bread was ancient but it was literally falling apart.</li><li>The bread just could n't support the stingy contents.</li><li>The bread we were served was not made in house and we did not get olive oil and vinegar with it but butter which was unusual and disappointing at an Italian restaurant.</li><li>They start you off with bread and butter but unfortunately, the bread looked just like slices of plain white bread from the grocery store.</li><li>The bread was just sliced white Italian, like what you can pick up in a grocery store.</li><li>There was, but I like that personally, if there is bread to dip into it ... but no bread was served to our table, other than the bread from our brushetta.</li><li>The tomato mixture on top was good, but the bread was n't properly toasted, so it got soggy and could n't hold its shape.</li><li>The bread was pasty and machine-cut and served cold with little packaged butter containers rather than olive oil.</li><li>Bruschetta was on the same icky bread and had way too much onion.</li><li>But we had to keep asking for napkins, cheese, bread and water.</li><li>The chicken parmesan needed a LOT of help and their complimentary bread is like eating cardboard with their packaged butter.</li><li>The bruschetta was very tasty, but their choice of bread is a bit weird.</li><li>It was like sliced sourdough bread, and it is the same as the regular bread they bring to the table, and is also used for garlic bread.</li><li>You wo n't regret it. service decent food quite good décor-forget it is this an Italian restaurant with the worst non-Italian bread ( non crusty and non tasty ever in an Italian restaurant pizza above average.</li><li>The bread was chewy and there was n't enough content.</li><li>The bread arrived first with a mix of French bread and Rosemary Foccaccia with a side of butter, hot peppers in oil, and black olive spread.</li><li>The bread here was mixed, and tolerable.</li><li>The only thing good about this meal was their complimentary bread/focaccias, but I 'm not going through that again just for bread.</li><li>I did prefer dipping the bread rather than eating the penne though.</li><li>They have some cut pizza and French bread as free bread ( which is a surprise!).</li><li>I do n't know why NONE of the packaging ate dated the manufacture date of the bread was baked) All western and even Chinese places that sell bread have have manufacture and expiration date ... see my pictures This place is great, if you like to buy good Persian food for cheap.</li><li>I do n't know why NONE of the packaging ate dated the manufacture date of the bread was baked) All western and even Chinese places that sell bread have have manufacture and expiration date ... see my pictures This place is great, if you like to buy good Persian food for cheap.</li><li>In addition the breads include regular western bread or fried breadstick.</li><li>You can definetly share one of these sandwiches as they are big and you can get extra bread.</li><li>The bread that came with the tongue was fresh and you cannot ask for more.</li><li>This place is very overpriced for a sandwich, and both the meat and bread was very dry.</li><li>The bread was ok.</li><li>Ever since I moved to Toronto, I became a bread snob and the moment I saw these garlic bread ... I knew they were made with the cheapest bread you can find!</li><li>But when the bread is weak, bisque is light and lobster sucks.</li><li>Their bread was good but too much butter and tad too salty.</li><li>I 'd never had a double before, so I have nothing to compare it to, but basically, I got two fluffy pieces of bread ( which I think were fried) sandwiching chickpea curry.</li><li>The bread was light and spongy.</li><li>For $ 1.50, I did n't think it was ridiculously cheap ( bread and chickpeas do n't cost much), but it makes a nice snack.</li><li>The flavour was really good, among the better sandwiches of these types ( even for being meatless) I 've had, but the bread could have been a bit crispier on the outside.</li><li>The pork was juicy and the dense bread soaked up the pork grease/juice.</li><li>The pork inside was also very tender and juicy, and together with the bread it was perfect.</li><li>Keep in mind the bread is decently thick, so it 's better to share this with someone if you want stomach room to try the other items!</li><li>These two items take longer to make than a HOT house made soft MO bread stuffed with sliced potatoes, marinated tofu, fresh tofu sheets and a signature spicy sauce.</li><li>I 'm going to base this review on my last visit, and think positive, usually its a terrible time at this particular location because the waiters have not changed in 30 years and they have no personality plus they like to charge you for the bread!</li><li>At another PB location, my brother substituted his bread for soup.</li><li>So theoretically speaking, I could sub my eggs for salad, my bread for soup, and I could have a full on steak dinner.</li><li>Next, we had some beef with a type of bread.</li><li>It comes out to about the same price if you went to a higher end Italian restaurant and had one entree, free bread and half an appetizer per person.</li><li>[ Main ] Pollo Balsamico- A very generous serving of piadina ( flat bread) with grilled chicken cooked in a balsamic reduction and was garnished with baby spinach, caramelized onions, goat cheese, sundries tomatoes.</li><li>The bread that they serve with the food is DISGUSTING.</li><li>The chicken roti was also not heavy and greasy, but I find the wrapped bread I tasteless.</li><li>The bread is very fresh, as well as the salads.</li><li>The bread was fresh.</li><li>The bread they use for toast is very thin and was like a cracker after they toasted it.</li><li>Close to home and very convenient for small necessities like bread, deli, and much more.</li><li>Fantastic bread, pastries and cakes too.</li><li>They have the best bread that is baked fresh everyday.</li><li>I discovered that the lunch menu is only on weekdays so ordered the chicken piccata entrée .. best piccata I have had in years with fresh bread, steamed veggies and grilled potatoes!</li><li>I found the sandwich super sweet and the bread kind of stale, but my dining partner loved it, best he 's had.</li><li>The bread sops it up nicely, and you get those really great soft bits.</li><li>It was not sweet and the bread was kinda soggy ....</li><li>The bread they used were harder than usual and the chicken were super dry.</li><li>I later tried yet again to order a gluten free sandwich, ( which was simple enough since they had the bread and other items) which she made no attempt to accommodate, when she asked me if I would like my sides to be the soup or dessert bread, I replied once again explaining that both of those items are not safe for a gluten allergy and I would like to substitute for fruit salad.</li><li>It came with a very nice Greek salad and delicious bread.</li><li>The bread the use is especially amazing and delicious.</li><li>The bread was extremely burned, and not even in one spot but everywhere.</li><li>Came with yummy bread and rice with grilled tomato- the perfect combination.</li><li>The owner even gave us complimentary bread with the eggplant dish!</li><li>The lavash flat bread is amazing.</li><li>Wait, there 's more, they charged us for the appetizers, I inquired and he said `` the bread was complimentary, not the appetizers''.</li><li>Food was very good in my opinion -- I have a sesame allergy and they were easily able to accommodate it when I ordered bread and so on.</li><li>Their bread and Mirza ghasemi is excellent though, so is their kabab options.</li><li>The complimentary bread was great.</li><li>Two types of house-baked bread, white and rye I believe.</li><li>We went back a few times for take out for lunch but then, disaster struck: they charged me for the bread.</li><li>People behind me in line ordered in Portuguese, bread was thrown in the bag and down the line we went.</li><li>I asked the dude if the bread was extra, he said no!</li><li>The bread was so fresh and soft, it was really incredible.</li><li>Symposim is a lot like the café mirage.symposium is a great place for breakfast but let me warn you they have so much trouble in the accuracy of my order I almost do n't wanna go back.Even though I like their breakfast/Brunch.I do n't recommend Going at dinner or lunch because the food slides down.doiring dinner and sometimes lunch everyday they have specials that have not very good food for a decent price.Their accuracy is bad I ordered a kids menu for my nephew and here 's what happens he ordered eggs and bacon meal which came with potato, eggs, bread and bacon and a drink and a desert My nephew said over easy they made it overheard there was no bacon on the plate and when my niece ordered a `` freshly squeezed juice'' it was bitter and had chunks or orange peal not even zest !!</li><li>The small piece of corn bread tasted like it was microwaved in old butter and it crumbled like sand when ate some.</li><li>They 're always eager to clean off your table once they notice you 've stopped eating .. first, we got a table that was highly uncomfortable, the seats felt shitty that we were/felt sunken in .... space is cramped .... just not comfy at all ... and food sucked .. i ordered a eggs florentine ... equivalent to a vegetarian eggs benedict, basically the same hollandaise sauce .... but it was o so shitty ... my friend ordered a club sandwich ... the bread looked like whole wheat wonderbread .. c-r-a-p. ( review for the bathurst &amp; sheppard location) Came in here a couple of weeks ago to order take-out as I was craving a burger.</li><li>Complimentary bread and finger food ( olives, pickles, etc) are a nice touch.</li><li>They have a selection of sweets with the typical cookies, muffins, danishes, and turnovers, combined with a large variety of breads, and bagels; from pumpernickel, rye, twist, whole grain, swirl, to a few others I ca n't think of at the top of my head, this bakery is a bread lover 's dream!</li><li>The hardest part was driving home and having my car smell like a bakery .. I was very tempted to devour the bread right in the car!</li><li>Do n't get me wrong the bread is amazing, but I was slightly disappointed when I went to get bread, and thought I 'd ask if they had gluten free bread.</li><li>Do n't get me wrong the bread is amazing, but I was slightly disappointed when I went to get bread, and thought I 'd ask if they had gluten free bread.</li><li>I was informed later that you can get room temperature ones from the back where they put the `` stale'' bread.</li><li>I think not.You get the point right ? Now I 'm questioning every item on their menu.Well, do n't be like me.Just do n't eat their food.Find something else. went there with a friend for lunch, it was buffet. the place was quite small but with a lot of places to sit! they have large tables too! the service was great, fast and friendly people. the buffet include: one soup 2 or 3 salad options many dips and sauces 1 rice 3-4 kind of vegetable dishes 5-6 meat dishes ( include chicken, lamb, beef, shrimps) they also have bread ( nan) and appetizers ( could not remember the names) they also have desserts ( 2 kinds) and fruits the taste was very good and not too spicy, however they have really extreme spicy sauces! the price was around 10 dollars as a neighborhood restaurant it one of the best options in the area and for sure I 'll be back:) This is a late review, I 've been a bit behind with all my travels = D I 've been to this place twice and the first time it was meh, I did n't even want to bother with a review.</li><li>Breakfast was good but as I finished my my meal the server came over and asked if we wanted dessert so I ordered bread pudding with rum sauce, as I get half way threw a notice something sticking out the edge so to my surprise I find the bread tag baked into the pudding.</li><li>So the manager comes an said sorry its cuz we used real bread and he still charged us for the dessert.</li><li>Here are some key points:- The bread was soft, tasted fresh, nothing crazy which is perfectly fine- The ham and turkey were both great, but not as good as the ...</li><li>The lettuce is shredded, bread is soft and fresh, and condiments are terrific.</li><li>Shredded lettuce, soft bread, a slew of toppings, and a loyal following of Belly devotees.</li><li>The bread they use is standard white or wheat.</li><li>The bread is always fresh.</li><li>I ca n't help but draw comparisons to Mr. Sub especially the bread and topping combinations.</li><li>The bread is amazing, the lettuce is better, the meat is way better, they put like 10ibs of bacon on the turkey bacon, and it 's GOOD bacon ...</li><li>Even jalapeño would make me happy:) Memories! back in high school my friends and i used to driver over here to grab lunch, the place has n't changed one bit:) i always order the Bacon Combo but make sure you ask for GRAVY! that 's a secret tip. what makes this sub so good ? everything! all the small details they add. the bread is nice and soft, lettuce shredded, bacon super crispy, and the friendly service you get everytime. they always make you laugh or smile.</li><li>Belly Buster sub gives you a nicely meat stacked foot long on a really, really creamy fresh bread.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
