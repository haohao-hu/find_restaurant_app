<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 48' %><h2>meals<br />occurrence: 157</h2><div><ol><li>I told the waitress that I was not paying for the meals and she called the manager over.</li><li>After a few prior meals it was good that I can walk from Centrepoint Mall at Yonge/Steeles to this location as when I passed it a few times it had limited parking opportunties.</li><li>It even bigger than before! its very impressive probably 200 items + and they had a good selection of not only desserts but set meals ( ie clay pot rices, and appetizers, and soups) The desserts are even better now, some are new like ice chow mein.</li><li>But now it 's not called The Sugar anymore since they 're starting to serve more set meals as opposed to Chinese desserts.</li><li>Knowing that there will be many awesome Chinese restaurants in the area, we decided to order small meals and try as many restaurants as possible.</li><li>Both their desserts and hot meals were very very good that a guy who was n't supposed to eat that late at 10:30pm but still ordered an appetizer and a hot meal.</li><li>The salad bar contains mostly starchy stuff like cold pastas or raw unflavoured veggies that have been sitting outside under their lights all day. the meals are mediocre ( the meat is always wayyy too chewy. too hard to chew or swallow. you know when steak is like that ? yeah.) and not anything special.</li><li>I agree with other reviewers- I only come here because of close proximity to work and it 's a fairly healthy alternative to food court meals.</li><li>There was a LOT of it- I could probably get 3 meals out of my portion.</li><li>The restaurant is not fancy by any means, but they definitely put in a lot of time and effort to create the set `` fancy'' meals.</li><li>Excellent, affordable meals.</li><li>I have had several meals here, never a bad one.</li><li>I specifically requested that the meals be served all at the same time.</li><li>We were all blown away by how delicious our meals were.</li><li>Now that I 've lost a ton of weight and am `` normal'' in size, I can safely say: combo 2 is* easily* enough for two full meals.</li><li>Each item was enough for 2 meals over ( about 6 plates total) and I was happy with the taste and quality.</li><li>Ordered Dinner got appetizers and the manager noticed we had n't gotten our entree 's yet so bought us a round, sincerely apologized and, then went out of his way to personally stay attentive while they got us our meals.</li><li>Sitting around a table with eight of my closest friends, all of them having come to the unhappy conclusion that their meals were overcooked, it could n't possibly be the horribly rough texture of the meat, or the fact that you had to slice into it like a cold, rubber tire, no. When the manager asked how our meals were and we all pointed out they were overdone, he astutely observed that the skylight we were sitting under was playing tricks on our eyes and in fact the meals were cooked perfectly.</li><li>Sitting around a table with eight of my closest friends, all of them having come to the unhappy conclusion that their meals were overcooked, it could n't possibly be the horribly rough texture of the meat, or the fact that you had to slice into it like a cold, rubber tire, no.

were cooked perfectly.</li><li>Despite us complaining about nine overcooked meals, only the birthday boy got his replaced with the final meal removed from the bill.</li><li>I can honestly say that the food quality was over any of my expectations, it was one of the tastiest meals I have ever had.</li><li>I got a beef doner which was literally the size of a newborn, i ate it for 3 different meals.</li><li>Price range: full meals are about $ 12 Ingredients are fresh, meat well seasoned, was offered tea and service is kind.</li><li>For sure it worth trying and I 'll be back for other meals too.</li><li>The menu does n't have an extensive selection of meals as other Viet restaurants but they do have the basics of spring rolls, pho ( beef and chicken), pho beef stew, rice and noodles.</li><li>They 're all basically family-sized meals.</li><li>BTW this is the same card they I used to get my rental car, check into the Westin here in Toronto, buy my meals all week .... according to them it was not being accepted.</li><li>Everyone else enjoyed their meals.</li><li>They have all sorts of Hungarian ( and European) goodies and delicious prepared meals for you to take home.</li><li>For the Sunday brunch, we decided to order our individual meals plus order a side of fluffy pancakes.</li><li>But anyways, I feel like I 'm going to be eating this for the next 3 meals.</li><li>The selection of meals is varied and rich!</li><li>With most of the meals I saw there was a side of fruit as well.</li><li>Nothing seemed out of the ordinary there FYI, while checking into Cora 's on my Yelp app, I received a coupon for the cocktail of the day with any purchase of a meal over $ 7 ( which most meals are anyways) for free!</li><li>The selection of food is great, as there is nice variety of different Asian meals like Sushi, Chinese, and Korean.</li><li>Truly a family run biz making meals using their family recipes.</li><li>Our order cost a measly $ 51.58 + tip, ( for 3 meals each).</li><li>This place is really a solid three stars and a half, but I have rounded down because the service is spotty- depending on who is serving you, and the non-pho meals drag down the grade.</li><li>The pad thai is not the best I 've had, and the non-soup meals are decently simple, but not disappointing.</li><li>Service-wise, the server we had originally take our orders left sometime after serving our meals.</li><li>3/4 of us wanted lighter meals, meals were spinach salad with chicken, cobb salad, a burger and sweet potato fries and tortellini.</li><li>3/4 of us wanted lighter meals, meals were spinach salad with chicken, cobb salad, a burger and sweet potato fries and tortellini.</li><li>Never checked on us once after we got our meals, she actually only came by to collect our plates and only said thank you and you 're welcome at the end when we asked for our bill because she thought her tip was coming.</li><li>We both enjoyed our delicious meals and we also liked the quick service.</li><li>Most of my friends were less than satisfied with their meals.</li><li>The great thing about Kiyomizu is that they deliver &amp; they have a loyalty system where if you buy X amount of meals you get discounts.</li><li>Then meals did n't come for a long time.</li><li>The `` regular'' ( realistically HUGE) portions for $ 2 more is a massive plate and good enough for two large meals ( I do believe the prices on the website are outdated).</li><li>This $ 8.99 dish is a big portion and can last 1-4 meals depending on how you hungry you are or how much you ration it.</li><li>Consistently a favourite hang out of Korean and Chinese students in the neighbourhood, Neagohyang delivers economical and delicious meals night after night.</li><li>Even though not all of us order set meals ( that include soup and salad), they still bring out soup/salad for everyone.</li><li>Presentation and taste for the meals is mediocre.</li><li>Our bread came quickly and we were given a full size order of hummus and then checked our bill and realized he had charged us for a full size hummus instead of giving us the small sized sides that already come with the meals.</li><li>I 've been there twice and ordered 12 meals.</li><li>Both meals were delicious &amp; portions were somewhat big.</li><li>A pretty straight forward affair, plates were cleared when we completed our meals and the bill presented in a timely manner.</li><li>All meals here come with free soup.</li><li>The meals are huge and have enough taste, tortillas are fresh ..</li><li>The meals arrived tepid ... the Brisket was chewy, with the attached beans and slaw served in small ceramic dishes, resembling the urine sample containers at the Doctor 's office ....</li><li>It 's awesome and it 's basically 3 meals in one.</li><li>Spouse and I agreed that this is one of the best Korean meals we have had in a very long time.</li><li>Other meals are not fabulous.</li><li>She did n't come once to our table to check or ask if our meals were good or if we needed any beverage refills.</li><li>I came with a fairly large group and everyone enjoyed their meals.</li><li>For $ 8, the portion size gets me through about 3 meals.</li><li>For some reason, the staff who bring the food never seemed to know where the meals would go.</li><li>The two orders came out relatively quickly and they enjoyed their meals, although commenting that the sauce was a bit too sweet in comparison with other General Tso chicken they 've had.</li><li>He had waited to order, as he was not sure if he wanted to indulge, and did so as we were halfway through our meals.</li><li>The Russian Borscht soup that comes with their meals is good.</li><li>Two meals and one side is more than enough for two people.</li><li>( This place loses one star because the meals were supposed to come with salad, but neither did.</li><li>I think these two meals are comparable with the pasta, sauce and protein yet one was $ 19 and the other $ 16, a price differentiation that did n't seem right.</li><li>I think maybe the key is that you need a larger group so that you can take advantage of the set meals.</li><li>Until now, we have always enjoyed our meals at Linda and were very pleased to see their new menus with greater variety.</li><li>Our starters and meals all came out at different times.</li><li>Not a great place for business or kid meals.</li><li>The meals here are also expensive compare to other BBQ joints.</li><li>They served 3 large pitas with our meals ... we only ate 2.</li><li>After we started our meals I noticed out of the corner of my eye a dark object moving on the table but disappeared behind a cup ( my friends reaction was enough for me to know what it was) I was trying to convince myself that what I saw was nothing but sadly a cockroach moved out from behind the cup ( my friend half crushed it on the table with a cup).</li><li>A lot of their meals come with a green/red ( black) tea but you can upgrade to a bubbletea if you wish.</li><li>I 've had burnt toast and other poorly cooked meals.</li><li>Pretty good price combo, most meals come with a drink and dessert for under $ 10.</li><li>Try the snacks like squid balls, thick toast with condensed milk, or try the meals like beef noodle soup.</li><li>Also, the meals come with a mini dessert, usually a small square of mango pudding served with evaporated milk.</li><li>Pros: the meals here are great.</li><li>We stopped a server and asked him how much longer for our meals, and he said 5 to .. maybe 10 more minutes.</li><li>I sat while my two friends finished their meals and left with no tip and never to return to this poor establishment.</li><li>Our meals were well below our expectations, and we would most certainly never order from them again.</li><li>They supplied us with more than enough wraps to last us for two meals!</li><li>The last few meals here were average but congrats are in order for ' Mr. Willy'.</li><li>Been coming here for a quick meals.</li><li>We got our meals and for the price, they were definitely pretty.</li><li>The meals were filling and looked great, and also tasted nice and fresh.</li><li>Their private booths are great for romantic meals and/or quiet conversations.</li><li>I needed clarification as to the number of Miso soups and salads included with the meals as i needed six in total.</li><li>There only about 9 different meals you can get and they range from a meat dish to a tofu soup dish.</li><li>We also got 4 banchans with our meals which were all pretty tasty.</li><li>They seemed to have a tiny, private parking lot in the back, but seemed to be a little inconvenient as they had to ask customers to move cars partway through their meals A good choice for some soup if you feel up for that.</li><li>Tables were packed wall to wall on a weekday lunch and we were the first of a growing line up that was out the door by our meals conclusion.</li><li>My hubby ordered beef tofu stew and I had a soup and beef bibimap- we shared and both meals were delicious.</li><li>Besides, the choices of meals are too similar to be considered exciting, and the menu has not changed in ages `` yawn''.</li><li>For the last three times I 've been here, I 've had what look like three completely different meals, even though I ordered the same thing each time.</li><li>Given I had three meals with a guest, we did try many more items, but I 'm afraid it 's all the same as above.</li><li>I went here today with two of my friends and we ordered 3 different meals.</li><li>The food had obviously been frozen as it looked and tasted worse than microwavable frozen meals.</li><li>Great for late night meals.</li><li>The pork bone soup they serve here is among the best meals I 've ever had.</li><li>Now wondering if they even cook their own food for their in restaurant patrons or if they just microwave these instant meals.</li><li>You make so much money that you even have frozen meals at T &amp; T supermarket!</li><li>Our meals came quite quickly and I did enjoy it.</li><li>But their meals are great too.</li><li>A quick survey of my friends whom were with me and they too enjoyed their meals and thought the portions were more than they expected.</li><li>Most of the meals, if not all, the meals come with fruits.</li><li>Most of the meals, if not all, the meals come with fruits.</li><li>It is one of the only places that can make an eggs benedict in the area and the meals come with fruits.</li><li>Although this place offers a gluten sensitive page on their menu, which means there are items in the menu which you should be able to order from, ( with fine print targeted at celiac suffered- which I made clear that I was not) the waitress will refuse to take your order and will leave you sitting there while the rest of your group sits and enjoys their meals!</li><li>We all got our meals except for my gluten-allergic sister, who sat there watching us eat with an almost kid-sized smoothie that was $ 4.</li><li>Our appetizers came at the same time as the meals, whereas I would have preferred if we had it to nibble on as we wait for the main dishes ..</li><li>They give you disposable paper place mats to eat your meals on at this place, so while the four of us were waiting for our meals, we started using the back of one to play Pictionary.</li><li>And they misled us to think the set meals are all-you-can-eat.</li><li>The meals are great value as well and we left stuffed and happy.</li><li>The people behind us had gotten their chips but the table beside us still did n't get their meals yet, while we were eating.</li><li>Overall, the delay in our meals was definitely not a good first impression for us but the food quality was pretty good.</li><li>If you want delicious meals with big portions for cheap, this is the place!</li><li>We finished our meals with tea and by the time we were done the restaurant was closed and they did n't rush us out which is nice.</li><li>If we knew that it actually was charged as 3 meals, we would n't have ordered as much.</li><li>The truth is I had some descent meals here.</li><li>Once we had finished our meals, coffees, a cappuccino and an espresso were ordered.</li><li>All in all the meals were ok in flavour and presentation.</li><li>The appetizer was skipped and we went right to our meals.</li><li>Looking forward to try out their regular menu on Sundays as they have some interesting set meals.</li><li>I have had enough eating home cooked meals.</li><li>The waitress that was serving us advised us that coffee was included with our meals ( we find out later that it is not).</li><li>Decent meals w. decent service and decent prices.</li><li>The table next to us also had water, and were served their beer as they were almost finished their meals!</li><li>The pork bone soup was enough for two meals ( I 'm REALLY looking forward to lunch today!)</li><li>Many meals have been enjoyed here over the years and a well earned vacation has arrived for the owners.</li><li>In fact it is good enough for two meals- I always go there for late lunch and pack the rice with the eel for dinner.</li><li>It 's enough since the meals are very large.</li><li>And all the meals were cold.</li><li>Fast forward ....... a few encounters with tortuously bad trendy/ fusion meals later, I 've come to appreciate this place more because it sticks to what it 's good at, and delivers consistently.</li><li>One of the best value meals just became less so.</li><li>You still get the garlic bread with Cottage Cheese and Pickles with your meals.</li><li>The Mongolian grill is hit or miss I 'm not a big fan of making your own meals as usually I get the flavors wrong.</li><li>Warning, this review might be a bit bias, I have a soft spot for mongolian BBQ as my parents owned a Mongolian BBQ restaurant growing up and I went here with my childhood bff who spent many meals w me at my parents place.</li><li>You 'd think that would give us a good hour and a half to sit down and relax and enjoy our meals and each other 's company, but at 2:45, the waitstaff are already hounding us: `` Last call is at 3:15.''</li><li>I found it very annoying that I had to wait for everyone food to be prepared separately ( it 's a big grill, cook 2 meals at a time or more, its already prepared for the chef all he has to do is stir it and dump it onto a plate. ( it takes 2 minutes on average per plate so as the 5th in line ( someone was ahead of us) it was a good 10 minutes before he got to me).</li><li>If there is one thing I have had lots of in my life it 's buffets; as a child, my parents had a quantity not quality approach to restaurants which resulted in lots of mediocre meals.</li><li>The dish is enough for two meals.</li><li>Ca n't believe they charge so much for their meals.</li><li>Most meals are a combination of meat with a bit of veggies over rice or noodles or sorts.</li><li>You can get bagels in all style, eggs in different style and salad and other light meals.</li><li>When he did come back, after we had completed our meals ( my girlfriend left 3/4 of her fish), he offered dessert.</li><li>I have been asked before if I eat all of the dishes when I review restaurants, and my answer is always that I am blessed to have friends and family that are more than willing and happy to join me in my search for the best meals.</li><li>The menu has mostly the usual fare, egg breakfasts, pancakes and waffles, a variety of diner meals.</li><li>We tried the king 's ramen, shio ramen, and gyoza- pleased with every aspect of our meals.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
