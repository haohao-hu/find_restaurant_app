<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 142' %><h2>washrooms<br />occurrence: 38</h2><div><ol><li>The washrooms could use some renovations, however.</li><li>I love the chicken udon, and the miso soup, and the shrimp tempura, and the apple cinnamon spingroll.The waiters are very friendly, and the washrooms are the extremely clean.I 've been here at least 60 times.The sushi is great, especially the spider roll.</li><li>Lastly, washrooms were dim and small but clean.</li><li>Modern design, clean washrooms, great food, a bar in the middle of the store.</li><li>What I love about places like this is that the washrooms are on the same level and it is spacious.</li><li>They are long and skinny establishments with sketchy uncared for washrooms in a basement.</li><li>There are lots of spacey booths, free WiFi, and clean washrooms.</li><li>The washrooms are renovated, very clean.</li><li>The washrooms have more stalls, 3 sinks instead of one, a bigger mirror and new flooring.</li><li>Decor: Minimal decor, washrooms are clean and ample seating.</li><li>The washrooms here are incredibly ghetto.</li><li>Nothing open at 2 am and you really want to look for a clean and safe washrooms in the area ...</li><li>That means tables, chairs, and if the washrooms are separated by sex, well, that 's high class.</li><li>The place was fairly clean and the washrooms are relatively clean compared to other comparable restaurants in the area.</li><li>Tip: Parking is horrible and the washrooms scary so take this into account before deciding to try this place anyways.</li><li>Sashimi impressed, as did the service; washrooms were difficult to find and smell of moth balls, but clean.</li><li>This shop has convenient parking, comfy seating, and very clean washrooms.</li><li>I ca n't wait to try their other milk teas and smoothies though:) Other than that, I liked the strawberry milk tea ... but I would probably ask for no sugar next time ... is that possible ? lol The washrooms are decent, sometimes lacking soap but it 's pretty good.</li><li>The washrooms are not very clean.</li><li>My only critic is the squid ink pasta is a little too sweet, and the washrooms downstairs could use some dusting.</li><li>I almost rolled all the way down and hmmm washrooms not the cleanest .. sticky floors etc ...</li><li>Even the washrooms were very clean.</li><li>While congee is a specialty, they offer a pretty wide range of food from noodles, some dim sum, and a variety of noodle dishes. + ives: price, quality, speed- ives: can be crowded, washrooms You must try their Singaporean Stir Fried Turnip Cake !!!!</li><li>The furniture and decor feels quite new and is always clean, the washrooms are clean and high-tech ( touch-less soap dispensers, paper towel dispensers, as well as the bathroom doors which you do n't often see), and they added an outdoor patio fairly recently which is very nice in the summer.</li><li>The washrooms are always clean and that 's how I rate a restaurants overall cleanliness.</li><li>I guess my only concern now is the washrooms.</li><li>Clean washrooms too!</li><li>The staff here are not very friendly and unlike the last review, I found the place outdated and washrooms not very clean.</li><li>The service is alright and I always feel a bit uncomfortable taking the stairs down to the sketchy washrooms but dang that soontofu tastes so delicious.</li><li>One thing to note is their washrooms are way too small for the size of this place!</li><li>A decent chinese restaurant with good food and clean washrooms.</li><li>Facility: Modern decor, clean washrooms, TVs on CP24 when we were there.</li><li>The washrooms can be a bit gross at times and the door for the entrance/exit is always smudged up with fingerprints.</li><li>The washrooms were completely flooded the last time I was there and wait staff in rubber boots and with plastic bags tied around their shoes were a bad indicator.</li><li>The washrooms do not provide paper towels, but in exchange they offer an over-powered hand-dryer that will blow you away if you 're not careful.</li><li>Overall, a fairly disappointing experience and to add onto it the place is starting to look rundown and washrooms were n't very clean.</li><li>First impressions were positive: nice layout and decor, slightly more intimate-feeling booth options, clean washrooms, and music at a reasonable volume.</li><li>The washrooms however could have been kept tidier but then again it is was a busy night.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
