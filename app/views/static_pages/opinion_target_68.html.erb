<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 68' %><h2>fried rice<br />occurrence: 89</h2><div><ol><li>We got some dim sum orders: shrimp roll, veggie dumpling, veggie spring rolls, chicken spring rolls, pork with black bean sauce, crispy chicken &amp; chicken Sho Mai along with some veggie fried rice.</li><li>I like the fried zucchini the most, the kimchi has a spicy-sweetness with a bit of sour, and the broccoli with the white salad dressing was the best. unfortunately the main was not as good anymore. the kalbijim was not tender at all, and there is n't any potato or radish with the stew. while sweet and sour pork tasted ok, but the sauce was a bit thick, and the batter too. the worst was the Kimchi fried rice, the potion was really small, almost no Kimchi in it, and it taste really sour, not in a good way. and the fried rice was n't hot, not spicy hot and not temperature hot, yet it just came out of the kitchen less than 5 minutes after we order it.</li><li>I guess they just put a pan-fried egg on top of some precooked fried rice ? on top of all, they are not busy that night, probably because it 's early around 6:30pm ...</li><li>I wondered what about the fried rice made it Malaysian but I guess it was because it had pineapple in it.</li><li>`` My fried rice always has ginger onion sauce''.</li><li>We ordered mushroom egg foo young, spring rolls, spicy eggplant in black bean sauce sauce with tofu, mixed vegetables, vegetable lo mein, vegetable fried rice, and mushroom egg drop soup.</li><li>Generally speaking, it works like so: you pick a `` base'', which is your choice of fried rice or fried noodles ( they have no problem with asking for half of each, which I usually do) and then you select a few other items they call `` toppings'', most of which are outlined below.</li><li>Considering most places raise their prices every 8-12 months, I 'm impressed! 3) My biggest complaint with most Chinese food places is that you have to order each dish separately, so if a group of people want fried rice, noodles, and a few different meats, they 'd have to order about $ 40 worth of dishes and then divide it up themselves.</li><li>The grains of rice in fried rice are supposed to separate.</li><li>Good dinner combos, delicious lo mein, fabulous egglplant ( especially when paired with the fried rice), fresh when it comes to your front door, and there 's always enough for leftovers.</li><li>We ordered noodles, house fried rice, ginger and onion shrimp, crispy ginger chicken and the green beans.</li><li>My boyfriend got the vegetable fried rice, which was good, nothing memorable about it though.</li><li>But the food is absolutely wonderful. we are regular customer, s at this restaurant, Tonight we ordered the usual, our favourte dish is peanut chicken, we brought our three dish, s home and upon opening the chicken we saw half the dish was peanut sauce and less than half the usual amount of chicken, I called the restaurant and spoke to the owner for ten minutes, she insisted that it was made the same as always, It was not at all, we paid 11,95 for peanut sauce and a small amount of chicken,, The arrogant owner could not care less, refusing to credit us for next time we picked up, or d delivering a new dish to our home, This place the staff is unfriendly, not well mannered, and horrible customer service, and the food was awful, except for the fried rice, it was good, If your looking for bad service this is the place to go, the customer is never right,, be warned, When Szechuan was still something Torontonians lined up for, Henry 's Hunan Place was the place to beat.</li><li>Last came the fried rice which we also enjoyed.</li><li>Ordered the cold noodle appetizer ( shown in pictures here), beef noodle soup ( lunch special), fried rice ( lunch special), mushroom and cucumber cold appetizer ( to balance out the heat from the the cold noodle appetizer).</li><li>The fried rice is just plain fried rice, no vegetables in it.</li><li>The fried rice is just plain fried rice, no vegetables in it.</li><li>Chinease dishes- also flavourless, infact I have never had such a bad fried rice.</li><li>I also orders vegetable fried rice, broccoli with garlic, and veggie spring rolls which were all AWESOME.</li><li>My favorites include the ginger chicken wraps with asparagus and brie, the refreshing avocado mango tomato salad and if you 're a fan of fried rice, the kitchen manager Jackie makes THE BEST fried rice ever !!!</li><li>My favorites include the ginger chicken wraps with asparagus and brie, the refreshing avocado mango tomato salad and if you 're a fan of fried rice, the kitchen manager Jackie makes THE BEST fried rice ever !!!</li><li>They make a very yummy fried rice with the remaining sauce when you finish the lamb stew.</li><li>Good: sizzling flounder, rock shrimp Okay: fried rice Bad: Any of the ramen dishes.</li><li>The fried rice is also good:) kthxbye Friendly management, Tasty and clean chinese food at a good price Since I order chinese for take out, this establishment.</li><li>I had a fried rice which was really dry and tasteless and my wife had a soup noodle which was greasy and soggy.</li><li>Fujian-style Fried Rice ( $ 6.99) Again, do n't let the name `` fried rice'' fool you.</li><li>They do use fried rice but they drench it with Fujian-style seafood and veggie stir-fry.</li><li>It does n't look like your typical fried rice, but it 's good nonetheless:) 5.</li><li>Their fried rice is really good and I especially enjoy the Yeung Chow fried rice that comes with a variety of meats and vegetables.</li><li>The dishes that are a must try here are the hot n sour soup, Cantonese chow mein, and the special fried rice.</li><li>Making this a quick review, I love their seafood congee, beef fun noodles, ying yang fried rice ( which is called fried rice with cream shrimp and sweet and sour chicken sauce ...</li><li>We always order the eggplant in hotpot, vegetable fried rice, sizzling beef with mushrooms and onion.</li><li>Ordered: Dak-Gal-Bee ( JS-1) 4/5* Chicken ( boneless dark meat) and assorted vegetables ( cabbage, sweet potato and greeon onion)* Choose your spiciness ( we went with B.
