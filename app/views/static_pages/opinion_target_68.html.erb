<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 68' %><h2>eggs<br />occurrence: 113</h2><div><ol><li>Mind you, it 's hard to mess up on a breakfast meal of eggs, sausage, peameal bacon, homefries &amp; toast.</li><li>Bacon came cold, like it was fried the day before and sat in a pan under the heating light, and our eggs were over cooked.</li><li>The eggs even though I ordered soft, only one of them was.</li><li>Strawberry Waffles are usually a hit ( PRO-TIP: with Nutella swapped for the custard) as well as the Gargantuan Feast which is just that: 2 eggs, bacon, ham, sausage, Canadian peameal bacon, blueberry pancake and roasted potatoes.</li><li>Will definitely gpnna come back, their eggs ben et dectone ham is pretty good and the wife loved it!</li><li>I ordered the Cora Special ( $ 10.95) which consists of 2 eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, house potatoes, toast, fresh fruit and a crepe.</li><li>The bf had Coffee with the gargantuan feast ( 3 sausages, 3 bacon and 3 eggs).</li><li>I would suggest the Rosemary 's Sunday ( because it had a little bit of everything; from eggs, sausage and home fries to pancakes) or the tuna melt.</li><li>I was n't asked how I wanted my eggs to be done and they were not runny like I 'm used to.</li><li>The food came out really fast ( under 5 minutes) but was just ok, my eggs were a little over cooked from what I asked, and my toast was barely buttered at all.</li><li>~ 20 minutes from ordering, my friend 's order of bacon &amp; eggs came; which in reality should take only a few minutes to cook on their [ hopefully ] professional kitchen grade grill top.</li><li>Prioritizing was clearly not in order at this restaurant and I could clearly see the waiters and supervisors/managers scrambling to multitask orders but not their eggs ( horribly corny pun intended).</li><li>My over-easy eggs were severely under cooked and runny, that lacked any taste so I slathered it with fist fulls of ground pepper and ketchup.</li><li>I love egg benedicts so I ordered a vegetarian option that was not on the menu ( the menu in general is not super veg friendly) for some reason they give you an option of having the eggs hard, medium or soft which I never experienced before in any of the brunch places. bennies just always come soft- otherwise they 're not bennies but hard boiled eggs on top of an english muffin, the portion included only side of fries and two bennies with spinach. no slices of orange, no toast included. total of $ 9 the spinach somehow had very grassy taste. hollandaise sauce was too salty and flavorless ... the whole food tasting experience was just blah. on the other end the service was very nice and even though they confused my friend 's order the replacement came in in matter of seconds and she was charged less. but I 'm not going back for eggs ... maybe will check pancakes or waffles.</li><li>I love egg benedicts so I ordered a vegetarian option that was not on the menu ( the menu in general is not

breakfasts.</li><li>My boyfriend had the New York style breakfast meal, which same with the potatoes and toast as well, and two eggs.</li><li>Went to this complete dive for eggs.</li><li>Since in Colombia, Arepa usually eaten as Breakfast or Afternoon snacks, so most of the Arepa here at Arepiando has cheese and eggs as the main ingredients!</li><li>The eggs and hash are the same as any other places.</li><li>First off, there were raw eggs ( I mean raw, running egg white!) in my food, when confronted, the waitress said it 's suppose to be that way.</li><li>I orderd mini steak, 2 eggs, toast, 1 hash brown, and a coffee.</li><li>I mean sure, eggs are versatile, but Hollandaise sauce gets kind of boring after awhile.</li><li>Unless you like tasteless, undercooked eggs and onions with onions that seem to have been sauteed a couple days before, do n't.</li><li>Coffee is fresh, eggs are perfect ( yes, you can screw eggs, try Newmarket and Aurora for breakfast) and the bagels are song!</li><li>Scramble eggs were ah nothing special and the salad was just a salad with no special flavours.</li><li>Ca n't say I was a fan of the eggs and lox.</li><li>Heard great things about this place came by for Sunday brunch but was disappointed we ordered the eggs benedict the steak and eggs and a kids meal my eggs were blanched not post and vastly undercooked unfortunately the steak was a little salty and not perfectly consistent with the other orders we saw coming out by the end of everything with one extra orange juice the bill was close to $ 50 we waited for service and the wait staff seems he prioritizing Cutlery over bringing us additional copies and our bill not thrilled.</li><li>Heard great things about this place came by for Sunday brunch but was disappointed we ordered

doors first opened, but inside a couple of months things were running tight with a friendly wait staff, a cheap before 11:00am breakfast special ( $ 3.99 for toast, breakfast potatoes, a couple of eggs and bacon/sausage) and some truly delicious burgers and sandwiches.</li><li>Food is great- Hazel 's has your signature brunch options ( eggs, pancakges, hash etc ...).</li><li>The nicoise salad (

and the eggs they give you are extra tiny! `` everyone knows, when you go to Buk Chang 's, it 's for the soon tofu. unless you have a serious aversion to the texture of silk, do as the locals do and order one of the gloriously smooth tofu soups. they are THE BEST in the city! although, soon tofu is sometimes referred to as stew, it 's more like a light, flavourful broth with pieces of vegetables, tofu, and sometimes meat. it 's served piping hot, and in my opinion, best eaten in the colder months. hints: parking is in the back alley nearby subway is finch station, head south 2 blocks see jimi 's review of the toronto location at: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/buk-chang-dong-soon-tofu-toronto.</li><li>Before they brought the dish, they placed a couple side dishes on the table and 2 eggs.</li><li>Suddenly, after the sizzling had subsided, my friend realized the eggs were on the table, and exclaimed `` THE EGGS!</li><li>My cousin asked why the eggs were so

enjoy it.</li><li>Their menu is extensive and one has the choice of choosing from their many options ( e.g. fruit, omelettes, crêpes, eggs, etc.)</li><li>FOOD: We all ended up gets the eggs Benedict which was pretty standard, poached soft eggs were done right.</li><li>In addition to that, I had eggs and waffles and my eggs did n't taste or have the texture of scrambled eggs- it was like the eggs

what a hoodlum. oy a broch. this might make virtually no sense to you at all or it might make all too much sense to you and either way when you are eating in the cramped space that is bagel plus youll hear this conversation in any number of incarnations at much louder decibel levels than in this review. right at the lip of one of torontos jewish areas ( spanning from as far south as eglinton you might say to as far north as sheppard all along bathurst as its spine) sits this boisterous place thats half bakery and takeaway and half sit down. there are classic chopped eggs, tuna, lox, cream cheese, and herring. then they have a bit of middle eastern flair with falafel plates. the falafel are huge and crispy. they also, make a great spinach salad with a huge ice cream scoop of chopped egg- im sure you can get a huge scoop of just about anything on it. and just about anything you get, will come with, as you would expect, a nice big bagel. i always enjoy my food whenever i go- the menu has long been set and they do it well, but i could do with a little less all the bar mitzvah talk. but when in poland ...</li><li>Bagel- nothing special, rather dry Eggs- omg, do they cook them
