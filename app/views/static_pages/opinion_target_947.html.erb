<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 947' %><h2>chicken meat<br />occurrence: 4</h2><div><ol><li>The chicken meat was very good.</li><li>So, I came here with my dad for dinner and we ordered: Spicy beef noodle soup- Big enough for 2 to share,- generous amount of beef, but was not very tender- soup base was not spicy and needs to be more concentrated- noodles tasted plain, but pretty chewy Spicy lettuce- crunchy and juicy- absolutely drowned in chili oil ( which made it more spicy than the noodle soup)- presentation was very unappealing Sweet and sour chicken- this plate screamed MSG with its neon orange colour- suprisingly there was a lot of chicken meat instead of flour Overall: Like I said ...</li><li>Once they run out of the chicken meat, no leftovers from yesterday 's seconds will land on your plate because they exercise quality like a gymnast on crack.</li><li>The chicken meat tastes juicy and delicious.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
