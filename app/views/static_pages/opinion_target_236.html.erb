<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 236' %><h2>spinach<br />occurrence: 19</h2><div><ol><li>The `` warm spinach salad'', cold; and the spinach was wilted.</li><li>I love egg benedicts so I ordered a vegetarian option that was not on the menu ( the menu in general is not super veg friendly) for some reason they give you an option of having the eggs hard, medium or soft which I never experienced before in any of the brunch places. bennies just always come soft- otherwise they 're not bennies but hard boiled eggs on top of an english muffin, the portion included only side of fries and two bennies with spinach. no slices of orange, no toast included. total of $ 9 the spinach somehow had very grassy taste. hollandaise sauce was too salty and flavorless ... the whole food tasting experience was just blah. on the other end the service was very nice and even though they confused my friend 's order the replacement came in in matter of seconds and she was charged less. but I 'm not going back for eggs ... maybe will check pancakes or waffles.</li><li>The melt-in-your-mouth goat curry is my usual order, but the chicken is awesome and the channa and spinach is so good and perfect for when you 're feeling a little vegetarian.</li><li>The spinach was bitter.</li><li>The spinach was cooked well.</li><li>We ordered the babaganoush dip, cheese and spinach `` pizza'', and the full combo platter that came with 2 pitas and hummus dip.</li><li>So I ordered the spinach and avocado salad with candied pecans.</li><li>They have a little eating area, free but precarious parking, stew had plenty of meat, spinach and beans, typical Persian stew.</li><li>The food was horrible, the chicken was under cooked, too sour, it was not stuffed with anything and it came with bones! spinach was below the chicken and the cheese was melted on top of the chicken chew skin: (, half a spoon of mashed potato that did not taste good and couple of carrots scattered around the dish.</li><li>I had the smoked salmon, spinach, and feta omelette with brown toast and a side of sausage.</li><li>The chicken crepe included cremini, spinach, swiss cheese, and a cream sauce.</li><li>We usually get ( and love) the spinach dip for an appetizer.</li><li>I paid $ 42 for 2 medium pizzas so with this price I was expecting something decent.while the 4 cheese one ( bomba) was not bad the veggie lover which had spinach, mushroom pepper and tomato was a disaster the whole thing tasted and felt like it was drenched in water.</li><li>The spinach and cheddar crepe-omelette was A-OK except that the sauce was cold.</li><li>I usually get the 10 star, but today I got the spinach and cheese omelette and it was just as good.</li><li>My bf got the ham and swiss omelet with added spinach.</li><li>Baked Almonds Crusted Woolwich Goat Cheese with grilled Portobello mushroom, wilted spinach, Honey raspberry dressing ( vegetarian) Char-Coal Broiled Lamb Shank Slowly cooked with scallion mashed potato, red wine, garlic, and rosemary Black And White Cakelet Devil 's food chocolate cake bean mousse, dark chocolate ganache Absolutely LOVED the salad ( must be the goat cheese!) and the lamb was excellent.</li><li>I was impressed that the spinach used in the dip was actual fresh spinach leaves instead of being blended.</li><li>My friend had some kind of pancake/breakfast special and I had the spinach and feta omelette with fries.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
