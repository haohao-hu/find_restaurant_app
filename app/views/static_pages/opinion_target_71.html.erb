the Tom Yong Goon soup ( I probably bastardized the spelling LOL) and it is pretty good ( I tend to get this soup when I go to a Spring Rolls) ... the actual Spring Rolls are my favorite and I order it usually as an appetizer ...</li><li>We got spring rolls as an appetizer and they arrived right away and were cold.</li><li>I have never paid more than $ 20 for an entree and appetizer here.</li><li>Honestly, was a great appetizer; which almost filled me up when combined with the beer; Not going to lie.</li><li>This is almost always ordered when I 'm here with my parents as an appetizer even though it always gets brought out after the pho.</li><li>I have visited the place more than 50 times and I keep wondering how they manage to always keep around the most professional of service staff, I took 4 of my office associates out for lunch and we each ordered a drink, an appetizer and a main course, waitress serving us memorized each of our orders without writing it down, while some upscale places have up to 3 people serving a table of five and would still manage to misplace or confuse an item or two per order.</li><li>Appetizer was as expected and a good size for sharIng.</li><li>After we ordered the dinner, the server told us there 's a Sunday special- if our order is over $ 30, we will have a free appetizer.</li><li>The appetizer we ordered was a sizzler

Biryani ( boneless): so delicious!</li><li>I would recommend an appetizer, the Kalbi ribs and a sushi/ sashimi platter to share for a party of 2-3.</li><li>And this is an appetizer- ON THE HOUSE!</li><li>Even though this is listed on the appetizer section of the menu ... it is by no means an appetizer!</li><li>The menu accommodates the mid-town location, surrounded by a lot of competition by including an appetizer of frites and a burger on the menu, but make no mistake someone here really knows what they are doing in the kitchen!</li><li>The Fresh Rolls are yummy too and a great appetizer to help get you started on your cure to your hangover.</li><li>The complimentary appetizer that they always give before bringing the entree out comes with garlic toast, fish paté and pickles.</li><li>For an appetizer try the garlic sautéed shrimps they are very tasty and the garden house salad with oil &amp; vinegar.</li><li>Ive been to this restaurant numerous times and till this day still get the chicken schnitzel with the home fries, cucumber salad and the cherry streusel for dessert but the best appetizer to get is the most amazing fried cheese it is absolutely the best thing I 've had in my whole life l love going there it is one of my favourite restaurants.</li><li>The sticky rice with shredded pork is a great appetizer and the snow pea leaves are fresh and green If carbs are your thing the fried noodles and pan fried noodles dishes are big.</li><li>However, we were told that we ca n't order just the appetizer, because each table could only place one order, so we have to order all the food at the same time.</li><li>Especially considering the restaurant was n't even that busy, I do n't understand why they could n't just take our appetizer order first.</li><li>We ordered 1 appetizer and 3 mains.</li><li>The portions for all the mains were pretty small, so we definitely needed that appetizer.</li><li>I had the vegetarian risotto and shared one the meat pizzas as an appetizer.</li><li>I had the pad thai, mango salad and an assorted appetizer.</li><li>My husband and I ordered the same dinner: prosciutto. with melon as an appetizer.</li><li>We started out with the Seared Canadian Sea Scallops ( $ 18) appetizer.</li><li>Two entrées, two desserts, one water, two sodas, and an appetizer ended up costing $ 71, plus a $ 25 tip ..</li><li>Our appetizer, the bocconcini with the tomato, ( caprese ?) was good, although again, somewhat bland.</li><li>We ordered a calamari in spicy tomato sauce as an appetizer.</li><li>He put our pizza in right away to make sure it was timed to be an appetizer.</li><li>And finally the last appetizer we decided to choose was the Tom Yum Goong ( hot and sour shrimp soup), which was also very delicious and flavourful.</li><li>For an appetizer, we had the calamari, and it was really good!</li><li>The mango salad was a refreshing, palette cleansing appetizer, and a hint of great things to come.</li><li>The mieng Kum appetizer is unique and great.</li><li>They 've shrunken down the amount of satays you get as an appetizer.</li><li>We ordered the spring rolls as an appetizer.</li><li>Disappointingly, after reassuring us that the items she had ordered were safe, her appetizer came out with cucumber ( what she is allergic to) as a garnish, which was touching her food.</li><li>Their signature appetizer- Mieng Kum is certainly very special.</li><li>Overall I was very happy with the appetizer and dessert, but very disappointed with the quinoa with duck.</li><li>I got the soft shell crab as an appetizer.</li><li>I tried a appetizer, main and dessert.</li><li>The marinated beef tongue cold cuts were also a good appetizer to the main meal.</li><li>We waited 1 hr to her our appetizer, and 2 hours waiting for our main.</li><li>Anyways, fine, we decided to change our order and get lobster grandin ( appetizer $ 12), garlic jumbo shrimp ( entree $ 32), and 1 1/4 steamed lobster ( entree $ 36) for now to see how the food is then get more later if we like the foods ( yes we were that scared).</li><li>The only reason I still eat there despite its horrible service and selection of appetizer is because of their table cooking.</li><li>They also give you this deep fried dough fritter stuffed with shrimp paste as appetizer ..</li><li>For $ 72, the price of a large combo platter, we got a centerpiece for our appetizer station.</li><li>We ordered an appetizer, one noodle soup and one dry noodle.</li><li>Based on Yelp review, we got Pork Jia-Mo as an appetizer.</li><li>Also, if you sign up for their mailing list you 'll get a coupon for a free appetizer- yay!</li><li>Had: Crispy calamari ( $ 10.99)- so if you sign up online ( name, email address), they give you an online coupon for a free appetizer!</li><li>It comes out to about the same price if you went to a higher end Italian restaurant and had one entree, free bread and half an appetizer per person.</li><li>Ive never had a pancake as an appetizer in Vancouver so I loved this little touch.</li><li>I would def come back here for the table top bbq tho. one of the best korean restaurant in town. they provide generous appetizer, and the taste of their famous pork bone soup is no where else to be found.</li><li>Did n't end up finishing it as I was full from the appetizer that the three of us shared.</li><li>Cost around $ 90.00 for 3 people to have a drink each with one appetizer and a meal per person.</li><li>We usually get ( and love) the spinach dip for an appetizer.</li><li>We went there since we got a free appetizer by subscribing to their website.</li><li>We each got an appetizer, an entree, and a desert.</li><li>My friend and I were waiting for one more person to join us so we asked for the appetizer to come first before we order so we could finish up first for the people waiting outside.</li><li>I love the appetizer they give you especially the tiny black beans.</li><li>I could n't believe they could pass this off as an appetizer at an `` authentic'' Italian restaurant.</li><li>We placed an order for the appetizer right away as we were afraid we 'd have to wait a long time.</li><li>There was also a simply salad as the appetizer ?</li><li>The Kim Chi used seemed very fermented as opposed to the kim chi served as appetizer, which was quite new.</li><li>We ordered Kashkeh Bademjan as the appetizer, the Barg, Fesenjoon and Ghaimeh.</li><li>Food arrived fast but the server did n't hear everyone 's appetizer order so I was stuck eating an appetizer alone.</li><li>Yoghurt/eggplant dip is good but could use a bit more seasoning; I find it is good if you accompany it with some of the parsley/onions given with the appetizer.</li><li>Last week my wife and I ordered the veggie platter as an appetizer.</li><li>THe appetizer was good; the main was tough and overdone; the dessert was vile ..</li><li>We were quite hungry after a long day of driving, so we started with one appetizer each.</li><li>The appetizer was skipped and we went right to our meals.</li><li>Along with the tacos, makes a very nice appetizer or snack.</li><li>The fat content was juicy and appealing for an appetizer ( but would be excessive with a whole bunch more if in a main course).</li><li>But if you have a vegetarian friend you either have to wait in the line for a long time to get seated downstairs, or your friend gets to order fries and watch you eat your entree while they pick at an appetizer.</li><li>My friend decided to order the special of the day which was an appetizer, main and dessert all for a special price.</li><li>The appetizer was `` bacon wrapped mac and cheese'' we were super excited because really how can you go wrong with anything bacon:).</li><li>I should have probably read the reviews on yelp before going to the restaurant .. but I did n't .. .. btw before i get started why is there filtered reviews ? maybe i missed something ..; anyways went here for lunch with a co-worker because its close to the office .. the decor is okay and we were quickly seated but thats as good as it got .. none of the staff make eye contact, everything is slow even tho the establishment was n't busy, there was just no importance on quality .. we ordered one of the lunch specials, the pricing is good, but I learned a long time ago, you get what you pay for, so for $ 7 to $ 15 you can get a salad, appetizer, sushi, chicken/beef, dessert, etc the food was cold and really average, they forgot our sushi and when we pointed it out to the manager he said he would take it off our bill .. a whole $ 1.20 ?? for 6 sushi rolls .. like i said u get what u pay for .. my co-worker, who is from hong kong blasted the manager, but he was no help ... so i will never go back .. but the experience got me back to using yelp!;).</li><li>We both had to ask the servers several times about my missing edamame, which was supposed to come as an appetizer but ended up being my dessert. wtf.</li><li>The servers also managed to forget the appetizer order for one of our party ... and finally delivered it to him at the same time that they were serving the main courses to the rest of us.</li><li>Ordered the duncan deluxe appetizer for two as well ( $ 55) once again have your food reflect the price you 're charging your customers.</li><li>The service was also great and I like how they bring you an appetizer when you first arrive.</li><li>For our appetizer, we ordered the gyoza which were MASSIVE and fresh: you could really taste the pork, ginger, garlic and green onion with every bite.</li><li>But if you try to order a small dish or appetizer, the waitress usually gives some convoluted story about how magnetic forces are n't aligned and how it is n't available.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
