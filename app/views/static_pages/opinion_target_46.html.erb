as the others review says, its amazing. so im not going to be talking about how great the pho is cause everyone else is already doing that. the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that sometimes i could taste the detergent they used while wiping or cleaning the bowls spoons or chopsticks with. it throws off the taste but i usually either just switch utensil and itll be fine or ill cleanit down with tea:).</li><li>Pho Dau Bo Finch, thanks for 11 years of great pho!
