<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 56' %><h2>pasta<br />occurrence: 121</h2><div><ol><li>I was warned that there would be nothing for me to eat here besides the salad bar, but I figured that was an exaggeration- surely there must be some appetizer, composed salad, or pasta that was n't full of meat on the regular menu.</li><li>The pasta was homemade and fantastic though, and the sauce complemented the dish very well, but I had just enough for one of the two pieces.</li><li>I love the pasta here.</li><li>I chose the vegetables for the siding instead of the pasta and those were nicely buttered &amp; herbed.</li><li>The pasta was al-dente and not overly sauced ( something I hate about most North American Italian restaurants).</li><li>The pasta was bland.</li><li>However, if I have to pay close to $ 20 for a small pasta it 's just not worth the time.</li><li>Tried both their pasta and pizza, pizza is better.</li><li>A good amount of her pasta was stuck together, starchy, and totally chewy.</li><li>Butternut Squash Soup- nice and hot, yellow squash soup with drizzle of olive oil and pumpkin seeds for added texture Spaghetti Puttanesca- great al dente pasta in tomato, slightly spicy sauce, with olives and capers ( no anchovies!)</li><li>The lamb pasta was so badly done, the dish was almost like a microwaved dinner; the meat was chewy, the pasta was disproportionately cold and hot, and the residual oil was overwhelming to my palette.</li><li>At $ 20 + per person, located at a upscale shopping mall I really expected more than a Pizzaiolo/Michelina 's pasta experience Suggestion: at an indoor mall it is awkward to have a wannabe outdoor patio section, plus the glass panels adjoining the two sections were too divisive and it felt like we were unwelcomed spectators to another Italian restaurant.</li><li>Just do n't expect good pasta.</li><li>Both the salad and the pasta were of lunch size.</li><li>They also have a couple selections of pasta too which is good.</li><li>While it 's also a safe bet for vegetarians ( the pasta is cooked in vegetable stock), you ca n't be guaranteed a seat here at lunch on weekdays.</li><li>It 's most quiet here during the weekend brunch hours, between 10:30 am- 3:00pm, where there 's all-you-can-eat scrambled eggs, pizza, roasted potatoes, pasta, salads and mussels ( $ 12.99).</li><li>Was the sauce on the pasta complex ?</li><li>Everything from appetizers, pasta, Hot sandwiches, to Lamb and seafood to Late night Deserts.</li><li>When you 're REALLY hungry, the pasta is not bad.</li><li>The pasta was delicious.</li><li>I was not a huge fan of their soup ( mayte that particular one was n't that great- just raosted pepper), but I LOVE their pizza and their pasta.</li><li>They also usually have specials for that day for pasta and pizza that is n't on the menu.</li><li>I tried the pasta which was ok but maybe because I 'm not much of a pasta person.</li><li>I would go back if I 'm in the area and craving pasta.</li><li>Perhaps it was the late hour, but my second try of the lasagna did not meet the initial expectation- it was drenched with sauce this time, which really diminished the taste all of the formerly beautifully constructed sheets of pasta and ricotta.</li><li>We ordered a pizza and pasta dish to share ( the pasta was, as expected, perfectly al dente, and the pizza was good too, not the standard thin crust at Pizzeria Libretto type places.</li><li>The portions was ok, both times we got great slices of bread to go with our pasta.</li><li>We also had the pasta which was perfectly al dente and the sugo perfectly seasoned.</li><li>Now you may be wondering why only 4 stars instead of 5 ... well the tomato sauce for the pasta ... not as good as mine ... lol but a good comparible.</li><li>The only thing that I did n't care for was the bread, you pay $ 3 for `` artisanal'' bread and it is 4 slices of room temperature bread, I was n't too thrilled about it, but I completely forgot about it when I ate my lobster Thermidor which is served with several types of mushrooms ( delicious) and pasta ( the pasta was n't great either, too much oregano, I recommend that you substitute this one).</li><li>The only thing that I did n't care for was the bread, you pay $ 3 for `` artisanal'' bread and it is 4 slices of room temperature bread, I was n't too thrilled about it, but I completely forgot about it when I ate my lobster Thermidor which is served with several types of mushrooms ( delicious) and pasta ( the pasta was n't great either, too much oregano, I recommend that you substitute this one).</li><li>The food was n't AMAZING, but the fact that I payed $ 13 and change including tax and tip for a gigantic pasta and gigantic wine is enough to bring me back.</li><li>The main courses; duck breast, papardello pasta w. beef bourgignon, steak frites and jumbo scallops were all delicious.</li><li>If you would like to add some chicken or peppers to your pasta, be prepared to pay for the cost of two pasta 's!</li><li>What a shame: they have a great wood-fired oven and could use it to make awesome pizza and other meats or fish but alas ...... the pasta is okay.</li><li>If you know me, you know I LOVE pasta!</li><li>This pasta was served with Italian sausage and rapini with pomodorini and pecorino cheese.</li><li>After eating some of the pasta, it was just a whole plateful of butter.</li><li>Good pasta too.</li><li>The pasta itself was a very large portion, saved it for the next day and it tasted even better.</li><li>Linguine Pescatore- very generous with the seafood and the pasta is always cooked a perfect al dente Excellent service, great atmosphere, take- out, menus available for parties/special occasions &amp; open for lunch!</li><li>The prices are a bit high 17-18 dollars for a pasta but not unusual for the Avenue road location.</li><li>Authentic family owned italian resto ... Has amazing pasta!</li><li>I think these two meals are comparable with the pasta, sauce and protein yet one was $ 19 and the other $ 16, a price differentiation that did n't seem right.</li><li>Nice tasty pasta and pizza. friendly staff.</li><li>Maybe I have to come back here when I have any urges for pasta and be loaded with carbs!</li><li>My pasta was well cooked, but the chicken tasted like something you would find in a McDonald 's salad and the mushrooms were good, but that was the basis of the dish.</li><li>Good pasta overall.</li><li>The chicken was seasoned well enough, and the portion was large, but the pasta was nothing special as it was dried pasta, and the vegetables seemed like it was from frozen.</li><li>The chicken was seasoned well enough, and the portion was large, but the pasta was nothing special as it was dried pasta, and the vegetables seemed like it was from frozen.</li><li>The pasta came out really quickly which sounded alarm bells in my head.</li><li>One taste and I knew the pasta was precooked.</li><li>As someone who loves pasta al dente, serving precooked pasta is a big no no for me.</li><li>But overall the food was a plenty, my guests bot had pasta and seem quite happy with it.</li><li>I really like their pasta ( not much of their pizza though) and I try to experiment by ordering different pasta dish from time to time and they were all very tasty.</li><li>They say that if your pasta is drowned with sauce, it may not be that great.</li><li>Linguine is my favourite type of pasta.</li><li>Here 's a detailed timeline: 8:10 Arrive at Restaurant 8:15 Ordered our Food 9:10 Waiter informs us he FORGOT to put in our order but ensures we will still catch our movie 9:20 Food Arrives ( The pasta was n't bad, but nothing amazing) 9:30 After gobbling down our dinner at record speed, we ask for the bill 9:35 Bill arrives and we quickly pay for it .. but wait why is the bill so expensive ?</li><li>The pasta was cooked very well, but it lacked what some would describe as passion and love for the food itself.</li><li>The pasta was cooked just perfectly, al dente, which I find difficult as angel hair gets overcooked a lot.</li><li>Their pasta was very flavorful.</li><li>The pasta with red sauce is tasty but the one with rose sauce is average.</li><li>The pasta came in a parchment bag and it was opened right in front of me, that was pretty neat.</li><li>4) Our main courses were delicious and the pasta was cooked well.</li><li>Italian food .. pasta la vista baby !!</li><li>However experience and quality wise- SURE! give it a go for some authentic italian food! i dont really like italian food ( well, until recently til tappo and paganelli 's .. but anyways). i used to find pasta so boring, plain &amp; bland that i would always end up eating some bland pasta covered in permesean/black pepper. theres no exciting flavors, it just doesnt wake up my tastebuds.</li><li>However experience and quality wise- SURE!

I told her that I would pay extra if needed.</li><li>I guess she did n't want me to watch her make my food since she told me to go back to my seat and she would bring me my pasta.</li><li>You have the rosti, pasta, burgers, sandwiches, seafood, and desserts.</li><li>There 's a station for salads, oven pizzas, crêpes, pasta and etc for all types of foodies to enjoy.</li><li>We once saw a cockroach crawling through the pasta!</li><li>My pasta was absolutely overpowered by garlic flavor and was something I can make at home in 2 minutes.</li><li>I 've been there multiple times, and the pasta is atrocious.</li><li>Whenever I 've come, I 've gotten their pasta.</li><li>The kid loves his pasta, I only wish the portion was a little more.</li><li>If you love pasta and do n't want to shell out $ 18-25 for a dish, I recommend Boston Pizza.</li><li>Their pasta is very good value and taste.</li><li>I 'm just saying I like Boston Pizza is great because it 's the only restaurant near my home with a good pasta special on a good selection of pasta.</li><li>The pasta is cooked perfectly and it is n't overwhelmed or overshadowed by the sauce.</li><li>The mussels were dry and inedible, the pasta that was n't in sauce was cold and flavourless.</li><li>It tasted like the sauce was mixed in with the pasta and it was sitting it a pot for a while in the back and they plopped in in my plate and served it to me.</li><li>I ate the garlic toast and the shrimp and left the pasta.</li><li>The pasta was sticking together it was just gross.</li><li>I was all too eager to bite into the pasta.</li><li>The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, the sauce was not too thick nor too watery, it was just right.</li><li>Would 've been great on a pasta!</li><li>This location unlike some of the other ones, does not offer pasta, pizza, French fries or have a hot table or have the mini sandwiches.</li><li>So I do n't know, what some people are talking about when they say they 're pasta is horrible.</li><li>The Penne dish was an all around enjoyable dish that I would recommend to anyone craving a lightly flavored, heavier cream sauce with their pasta- it 's a safe bet.</li><li>Whoever decided to start selling cheap disgusting pasta 's at a Pizza restaurant should be shot.</li><li>Was n't the best pasta I 've had, but was n't bad either.</li><li>The penne cacciatore was picture perfect, with the exception of the rose sauce, which I felt was slightly too watered for me as there was n't that pungent taste that came after having the pasta.</li><li>When the food finally came the pasta was cold and the osso bucco was way too salty.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
