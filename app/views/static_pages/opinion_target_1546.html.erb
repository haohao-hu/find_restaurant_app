<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1546' %><h2>black cod<br />occurrence: 3</h2><div><ol><li>Ordered the miso soup to start which was very flavourful ( much better than the ayce sushi restaurants), for the main was the black cod which again was very well seasoned and cooked to perfection.</li><li>We would genuinely recommend the one in yorkville Toronto or try Iron Chef in Mississauga- it 's the best! ( The black cod at iron chef is amazing !!).</li><li>( $ 33) We also got the black cod, which was very nice, smooth and crunchy. it same with small side garnishes, including a sticky rice mochi wrapped in a bamboo leaf, some pickled veggies, all edible.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
