<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 887' %><h2>fish cakes<br />occurrence: 5</h2><div><ol><li>Aside from fish &amp; chips, High Street also sell a few types of meat pies and fish cakes.</li><li>Would n't recommend fish cakes, not that there 's anything wrong with it.</li><li>So these really awesome fish cakes are now gone.</li><li>You get small round dishes with bean sprouts, cold potatoes in gooey sweet sauce, glass noodles, kimchi, fish cakes, seaweed ( not like you get at sushi places, this one is saltier, with more of a sea-taste to it) and little bean dish.</li><li>The side dishes selection was not as large as some other places, but they did have seaweed and fish cakes so I 'm not complaining.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
