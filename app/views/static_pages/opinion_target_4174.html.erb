The Joons Original Spicy Sauce)* $ 9.25 per portion ( 2 portions minimum), we ordered 3 portions for 3 people* Extra Add On: rice cake, mozzarella cheese, instant noodle, vegetables and fried rice* Extra add ons are all $ 2 except the fried rice* Everything is thrown together and comes to your table uncooked* Because it 's chicken, they take a while to fully cook and it drives you crazy* Servers will come around and cook them for you so do n't worry about the process* If you order mozarella cheese, they come midway and add it on near the end* For 3 portion order, I found there were n't much chicken* Original spicy sauce is not spicy at all !!</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
