<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 207' %><h2>cakes<br />occurrence: 24</h2><div><ol><li>A pair of shrimp-and-crab cakes should also be shared, but between it 's crispy exterior and sweet melting seafood, greed may indeed be good.</li><li>I 've gotten waffles, crepes ( of course heh) the cakes, the lattes and the iced drinks as well.</li><li>The cakes could definitely be improved in terms of flavour, but they look incredibly scrumptious so the appearance threw me off.</li><li>I been to Pastel before and mostly I come here for the cakes ( which is from Rahier) I came here to mini celebrate my friend 's birthday and she ordered a cheese cake.</li><li>Anyways got the menu again and order a crepe since by then all the cakes were gone.</li><li>I 'd go back again to see how the rest of their cakes were ( I was in a happy-full state and forgot to order a few to go), but I do hope this place sticks around for a while.</li><li>However, the cakes I had yesterday ( coffee flavoured and crème brûlée) was awful.</li><li>Their crepes are perfectly cooked and they have many sweet and also gourmet crepe options. service was amazing Their cakes are awesome!</li><li>The cakes are from Rahier- it will save you a trip but you can probably buy it elsewhere if you are craving cake.</li><li>The cakes are too sweet and too big.</li><li>On top of their well known crepes and waffles, they always have amazing cakes and cookies to choose from.</li><li>We go and look at their cakes, my guest asks what kind of cake a certain one was and the guy just looks at it and swats his hand and a good 30- 40 fruit flies just disperse into the air .. and that leaves us noticing that the cake now looks COMPLETELY different haha so we decide to have some fresh made crepes, ca n't go wrong with that right ?</li><li>Only their cakes were decent.</li><li>Their cakes are delicious as well.</li><li>I am interested in trying their dinner menu and while I could n't do it at the time, because I was already full from brunch, their daily deals seemed promising- Sundays offering 2 for 1 cake slices and the cakes looked delicious.</li><li>It 's the best meringue cake in the city probably. and the rest of their cakes are really good as well!</li><li>I do like that their cakes are n't overly sweet though.</li><li>They have the best cakes ever.</li><li>Seemed to be a very popular place for their cakes, especial popular amongst the older Asian ladies who tend to favor cakes with less sugar.</li><li>Their cakes are ok, but if I 'm eating a cake with lots of calories, it might as well be sweet.</li><li>Price was $ 20-40 for entire cakes ( not sure about how much per slice, though .. but since it 's an Asian place, you do probably get your money 's worth) Maybe go to this place for the baked goods.</li><li>The cakes are reasonably priced and not too sweet like most Asian bakeries.</li><li>Despite the bad service the cakes here are good.</li><li>My family has been going to Maxim 's for at least 15 years for their cakes.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
