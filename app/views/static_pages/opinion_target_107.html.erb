<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 107' %><h2>potato<br />occurrence: 66</h2><div><ol><li>Vegetable lumpia is different, they must make it with sweet potato, quite gross in my opinion.</li><li>Portion size: Great assortment of banchan ( appetizers) in the form of ... kimchi, seaweed, spiced cucumber, sliced potato ( ?) and lettuce w/ black sesame dressing ( ?).</li><li>I got chicken thighs on potato, rice and possibly banana ?</li><li>The rotis all come with potato in them, and it 's just the right amount to not overwhelm the meat.</li><li>Roti 's seemed more like filled tortillas, and the potato one has a curry sauce that was unpleasantly gloppy and tasted like little more that curry powder and cornstarch.</li><li>I got the green tea and the sweet potato.</li><li>The steaks were cooked perfectly and came with loaded baked potatoes ( you could have other sides if you wanted- vegetable, salad other type of potato).</li><li>One of my favorite sides is the potatoes and the hummus. really a hole in the wall! love their potato and rice besides the main dish.</li><li>Good flavours although today the server dropped potato pieces on the counter while serving and he picked it up and still served it.</li><li>I`d give it a 5 if not for the over powering taste of sweet potato in the roll.</li><li>Shredded potato had a good texture, but the dressing was a tad ... strange for shredded potato.</li><li>Not a potato was seen in my food.</li><li>I ordered their Chicken Teriyaki which came with a bowl of rice, miso soup and side dishes of potato, zucchini and sprouts.</li><li>Ordered: Dak-Gal-Bee ( JS-1) 4/5* Chicken ( boneless dark meat) and assorted vegetables ( cabbage, sweet potato and greeon onion)* Choose your spiciness ( we went with B. The Joons Original Spicy Sauce)* $ 9.25 per portion ( 2 portions minimum), we ordered 3 portions for 3 people* Extra Add On: rice cake, mozzarella cheese, instant noodle, vegetables and fried rice* Extra add ons are all $ 2 except the fried rice* Everything is thrown together and comes to your table uncooked* Because it 's chicken, they take a while to fully cook and it drives you crazy* Servers will come around and cook them for you so do n't worry about the process* If you order mozarella cheese, they come midway and add it on near the end* For 3 portion order, I found there were n't much chicken* Original spicy sauce is not spicy at all !!</li><li>No potato in my gamjatang, and the soup was a little bland.</li><li>The food was horrible, the chicken was under cooked, too sour, it was not stuffed with anything and it came with bones! spinach was below the chicken and the cheese was melted on top of the chicken chew skin: (, half a spoon of mashed potato that did not taste good and couple of carrots scattered around the dish.</li><li>Normally, when a menu says knish ( at least from what I 'm accustomed to) they are potato- if meat or kasha they are usually labeled as such.</li><li>Unliess you like your potato latke microwaved ( !!!), soggy and devoid of potato, ` T!</li><li>$ 38.00 for 10 shrimps, and they ca n't throw in a 25 cent potato ?</li><li>4./ You can keep your prices the same if you have a vegetable, salad, and potato or rice with the entree.</li><li>Salad, side rice, potato are all very bland.</li><li>The one potato was under cooked, hard as F and the rice was dry.</li><li>I loved their schmorgashboard of ramen, cheese, chicken, rice sticks and sweet potato in one dish!</li><li>My typical selection is cheese, noodles x2 since we have two people and sweet potato.</li><li>The appetizers consist of: two pieces of broccoli, half a scoop of potato, some kimchi and a few beans.</li><li>After our Dak Gal Bee ( chicken, veggies, with extras of rice sticks, sweet potato and seafood) was mostly done, our waitress added white rice and made a delicious fried rice dish on the wok using the remaining sauce.</li><li>The side dishes was very mediocre- We had kimchi, potato ( very good and creamy), radish and broccoli.</li><li>Dak galbi ( marinated chicken stir-fry on hot plate- traditionally dark meat chicken is used, but I do n't know what kind they use here) is their specialty but a la carte menu is offered too. banchan has the usual napa cabbage kimchi, beansprouts, but the one i especially like is their simple but good steamed broccoli with a dash of gochujang. personally i like gochujang with everything, but it may not be fore everyone. they also have a mashed potato banchan which i did not try. if your order the dak galbi, i recommend extra orders of tteok ( rice cake sticks), sweet potato and pumpkin. cheese ( looks and tastes like mozzarella) is offered too, giving it a fusion/modern twist. ramen is also on the menu. service is attentive, friendly and pleasant. quite a roomy restaurant, which is surprising if you merely look from the outside. unlike many other korean restaurants in toronto, you can actually linger here for a while, given enough seating for everyone. will DEFINITELY come again.</li><li>The side dishes here are lacking compared to Nak Won, here you get broccoli, mashed potato, kim chi and radish.</li><li>We had the mashed potato, kimchi, seaweed and sweet-sour radish.</li><li>Food: My order is usually the same, Dak Gal Bi with ramen, sweet potato, rice cake and cheese.</li><li>The JS1 is just normal dak gal bee with chicken and vegetable where you can add on the rice cakes, cheese, noodles, sweet potato, vegetable, steamed rice and fried rice for $ 1- $ 2 each.</li><li>Extra add-ons include rice cakes, sweet potato, and mozzarella cheese ( a must get!).</li><li>Initially I subbed it with roasted pepper with dressing on the side- after the staff forgot to leave the dressing the other side, she immediately took back my order and made it from scratch again- second time I also swapped out the lemon ricotta for sweet potato.</li><li>Generally Pastel 's dessert are n't overly rich, heavy or extremely sweet but they certainly have a lot of unique flavours such as sweet potato, black sesame and taro.</li><li>The sweet potato latte was everything sweet potato I could imagine.</li><li>There were n't chunks in it, but it was very authentic .. exactly like a sweet potato in liquid form with milk.</li><li>More places need to have sweet potato!</li><li>Muuuuuust have: black sesame crepe! love the ice-cream that comes with it and the sesame filling in the crepe. really really sesame-y! also, plzzz try their sweet potato latte. the foaming is rich and the sweet potato tastes legit. i cant event resist it in hot hot summer LOL. especially when winters coming, drop by and grab a cup of latte. wo n't disappoint you;).</li><li>It also came with two scoops of sweet potato ice cream, but none of us really thought it tasted like sweet potato ... maybe it was taro, because it was kind of a greyish-purplish colour.</li><li>They put the sweet potato inside the crepe as well.</li><li>I recommend the black sesame ice cream crepe, it was tastier than the taro/purple sweet potato one which had little taste.</li><li>Their homemade purple sweet potato ice cream honestly did n't taste much like purple sweet potato.</li><li>A good mix of Asian flavours ( for example black sesame ice cream) and other unique flavours ( sweet potato).</li><li>Order the sweet potatoes Crepe with homemade sweet potato ( maybe taro ?) ice cream and the watermelon slush drink.</li><li>I ordered the sweet potato one and with the maple syrup and ice cream ( supposedly home made and should taste like sweet potato but didnt) ...</li><li>This was very good ... tastes exactly like blended sweet potato .. thick and rich in flavour.</li><li>Very cozy and comfy. ordered their Wednesday special- 1/3 rack of ribs and chicken wings for $ 14. fries were good- you can actually taste the potato: P chicken wings were absolutely amazing. highly recommend chicken wings!</li><li>A lot of tender meat, enough veggies and a potato ( `` gamja'') was there.</li><li>It is quite savoury and besides the meat, the soup has potato, vegetables, and perilla seeds.</li><li>I could n't even find a piece of potato.</li><li>It comes with small salad with no dressing, potato and few fruits.</li><li>Pouched eggs and potato were perfectly cooked.</li><li>Normally it almost seems like a faux pas to order the same thing at the table but we went ahead with a couple variations in which salad we ordered it with an which kind of potato.</li><li>After that brought me over cooked burned potato !!</li><li>I asked her why its like that, the manager told me that how we serve the potato !!!!</li><li>Lots of flavour, no lack of pork or bones, and good amount of thoroughly cooked potato.</li><li>Potato was luke warm in the soup.</li><li>You can always ask for more, though at this location, they are stingy with the sweet potato.</li><li>Generous amounts of glass noodles, kimchi, potato, bean sprout, seaweed salad, and a variety of other cold dishes that are all more tasty than the main course itself.</li><li>The side dishes usually include kim chi, kelp/seaweed, pickled radish, potato, bean sprouts, soybeans, and japchae/glass noodles.</li><li>It came with one piece of sweet potato which was still kinda hard and there 's like the smallest bits of fig on it.</li><li>Their accuracy is bad I ordered a kids menu for my nephew and here 's what happens he ordered eggs and bacon meal which came with potato, eggs, bread and bacon and a drink and a desert My nephew said over easy they made it overheard there was no bacon on the plate and when my niece ordered a `` freshly squeezed juice'' it was bitter and had chunks or orange peal not even zest !!</li><li>Next comes garlic bread which was delicious and very garlicky, next were salads which was a bunch of iceberg lettuce and a single slice of tomato, and finally was the entree, served with a choice of potato.</li><li>The assistant came by and served the potato but he was really hurried and kind of violently dressed the potato.</li><li>Side potato was fantastic and the portions were generous.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
