<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1488' %><h2>samgyeopsal<br />occurrence: 3</h2><div><ol><li>We had a table of four people and ordered the samgyeopsal ( set for 2) and the haemool jeongol ( set for 2).</li><li>Oh Geul Boh Geul 's soups, stews, tonkasu, samgyeopsal and kalbi are all decent, yet very average tasting.</li><li>I 'll be back. maybe it 's just me but some of the stinkiest Asian foods out there always tend to have strong but tasty flavours to it. eventually u just get use to the smell but man this bean paste type soup is always welcome in my stomach. although the bowl ( $ 10) with rice does not appear very big it does fill you for a lunch meal. as mentioned in other reviews the service was good. def be back for lunch again soon. fantastic samgyeopsal !!!!!! although the price is a bit more expensive than other korean restaurant, the quality is not comparable. best quality for its price. the owner is super nice and his english is really good. he 's a fun person to talk too. the place is quite small but its never packed ( everytime when i visited).</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
