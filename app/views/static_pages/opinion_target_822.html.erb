<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 822' %><h2>doors<br />occurrence: 4</h2><div><ol><li>Go in the doors by O &amp; B;).</li><li>And the doors are completely camouflaged against the walls ...</li><li>I 'd definitely go back to this restaurant again to try out their other menu items. family owned italian restaurant. short summary: very yummy food, portions could be bigger, sometimes slow service but very friendly lady owner, always packed at lunch, which is frustrating since they dont accept reservations. longer summary: the decoration of the restaurant is very cozy and gives a feeling of a patio dining even though it 's all indoors. the service though slow is very friendly and we often end up chatting with the owner for few minutes while we 're waiting for the order. it usually gets very packed at lunch by the people from surrounding office buildings. and since they do n't accept reservations sometimes it means that you have to arrive right after the doors are open ( which is 1130am everyday I think) in general very welcoming place but a bit on a pricey side.</li><li>No complaints on the food:) Only reason I did n't give it a full 5 stars is because the heat was not on in the restuarant and the doors kept being opened, so everyone was freezing!</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
