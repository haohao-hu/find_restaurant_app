<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 938' %><h2>french fries<br />occurrence: 4</h2><div><ol><li>Stay away from this restaurant you have been warned. it 'll be the first time and most likely the last time i 'll go there. i had high expectations of a place that has lobster in their name coupled with the fact that they are in one of the more higher end areas of the city. maybe that 's the downfall. from the outside, it looks like a place that you 'd find in a old strip mall, and the interior 's more of the same. when i saw that the food and wine menu were both laminated, i started to get an idea as to what i was getting myself into both pricewise and food quality. our server was not the most attentive to our needs even though we were a group of 12, and was noticibly pushing certain items on the menu. there were also a couple of kids with us and she was n't the most friendliest person with them, seemingly just focused on doin what she needed to do to make her coin and turning the table over. not that i find it wrong but it 's not something i 'd expect from a place that you 're paying up to $ 94 for a four pound lobster. me and my friend ordered garlic shrimps to start. they were of a decent size and flavour but were lacked presentation and quantity for what we paid. i 'm not really concerned with presentation that much on the regular but the plate they served it on made it look like we were n't getting a lot or we were missing something. we both ordered a 1lb lobster with baked potato and soup. we were informed that the french fries were not available which again i would n't expect from a place where you are paying so much for your meal. my soup was a new england clam chowder that was nothing special at all. the soup nutsy or even the marche had better. the baked potato was plain with just a small dollop of sour cream to consume it with. the final item to arrive was the lobster. i ordered for it to be broiled which it did but the ' stuff' ( cause i do n't really know what the heck they decided to put on it) just made it a very messy proposition to eat. it did n't really do much to enhance the enjoyment of the lobster, and it made me wonder was it really worth the coin i just dropped for this. the whole meal just tasted only just average. the whole experience was topped off when our bill came and our waitress almost made it a point to point out that the gratuity was not included in our bill. if you really want lobster, i would just say to go to red lobster and do it there. you 'd probably pay just the same but the service would definitely be better and so would the flavours !!</li><li>I ordered ENGLISH STYLE FISH &amp; CHIPS and MIA was coleslaw and pickle slice, and in my view 1/2 the french fries, for $ 13 I expect a full plate.</li><li>I was inspired to write this review today while biting in to one of their great french fries.</li><li>As well as French fries Overall sandwich could have been better.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
