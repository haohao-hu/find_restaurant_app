my salad literally had lettuce, cheese and 4 mandarin oranges in it).</li><li>Entrée #6, a burger- the waitress checked the kitchen and reported `` The chef dropped your burger on the floor.</li><li>We had waited an hour, yet the chef would remake an entrée in 5 minutes ?</li><li>As I pursued the menu I was told there is no chef, but he should be there in ten minutes.</li><li>As thirty plus minutes later there was still no chef after the bartender made several calls to find out what was going on, and where the chef was, and when he 'd be in.</li><li>As I asked to settle up he said the chef is here now, sorry too late.</li><li>The chef was given a budget of $ 25 per person and the restaurant really delivered!</li><li>Because of dietary restrictions on the part of some family members, we had elected to go with the `` tasting menu'' or the chef 's choice, giving the chef a budget and the food constraints.</li><li>Because of dietary restrictions on the part of some family members, we had elected to go with the `` tasting menu'' or the chef 's choice, giving the chef a budget and the food constraints.</li><li>Giving the chef a budget of $ 400 for 9 people, with these constraints was probably our mistake.</li><li>Since we 're cutting out one of the most expensive ingredients in Chinese cooking -- shellfish like lobster, crab, abalone -- I would have expected the chef to choose ingredients that are finer or of higher quality or just special in some way to substitute.</li><li>To be fair, I did n't get a chance to review the menu before hand and thus, otherwise I would have raised this concern with the chef.</li><li>The chef had basically de-boned a whole chicken, roasted it till it was perfectly done -- the chicken was moist and tender, but the skin crispy -- including the stuffing which was pearly white tender grains of rice.</li><li>Note that this review is based on ordering the chef 's choice or tasting menu, which had to be booked in advanced.</li><li>The reason for it being a gem- is the chef.</li><li>The chef seems to be really creative with his presentation.</li><li>On one recent trip the chef came around the bar to correct the plate position in front of me; apparently the server had put it the wrong way around.</li><li>The head chef opens her house on some Saturday mornings for a cooking school of which I have attended a few classes.</li><li>For 2 people we ordered the appetizer platter and the chef selection.</li><li>Went for lunch the other day had the chef 's special lasagne and salad for $ 10.50- amazing!</li><li>I 'm not sure if it 's a chef issue or a pizza oven issue or a supplier issue, but you just never know what you 're going to get.</li><li>Why ca n't someone open a restaurant and hire a chef who prepares quality proteins with great wok hay and uses an abundance of garlic, chill and ginger where the food is n't doused in grease.</li><li>The food quality and flavour is n't something a chef can really dictate over, its up to headquarters and; 2.</li><li>The soup tastes just so so, you do n't need to go to a restaurant to have it, you can make it at home ( after you try it, you will find you can cook better than the chef)!</li><li>As with another great comment below; the waitress asked if all was good and told her about my awful plate and her reply was I will talk to the owner and the chef is really good.</li><li>During our meal 10 other patrons arrived ( 2 were children) Only one waiter, and one chef, tending the large pizza oven.</li><li>Overpriced, food is bad, we ordered the soup, and the chef made a mistake and put curry powder with lots of salt, it was disgusting, and how did they attempt to make up for it ? they got us an extra desert, what a joke.</li><li>A good chef can probably elevate The Miller to being a solid uptown option, but until then it 's just another blah waste of stomach room. been here multiple times and was very disappointed the last couple times I had dealings with them.</li><li>I noticed the chef has his hat on but did not tie it up so his long hair was waving around and partially covering his face.</li><li>Quality sashimi balanced by tasteful cooked plates, beautifully arranged plates, beautiful ambience, extensive ETOH menu, and charming chef and waitress.</li><li>Here the delicate cuts to the fish can be seen and the recommendations by the chef can be made.</li><li>The chef 's kept shouting, seemingly to themselves, and that was quite irritating.</li><li>The chef ( grisha) make food really well.</li><li>The fish and avocado was very fresh and the service ( albeit slow) was very friendly- even the chef 's greeted me with overwhelming warmth!</li><li>The chef takes great care to turn out each piece and it shows in appearance and taste.</li><li>Service 4.0/5- The staff is very friendly here all the way down from the chef to the hostess to the servers.</li><li>As I looked at the exterior of the restaurant I saw a sign that they had the number 1 chef in the world and it made me chuckle as I walked into this restaurant.</li><li>Wont be running back here, the chef needs to take pride in the sushi he is making, and not put out such small rolls.</li><li>As both my picky, and hard-to-impress parents would later comment `` Tutto 's chef knows how to cook.''</li><li>The server noticed I had cleaned out my plate and was very happy to let his chef know.</li><li>The chef and staff eat with the customers .. which is unheard of.</li><li>Again we flagged down the waitress asking her about the blood; whether the chef had cut himself.</li><li>I went there and I ordered a large rare beef to go came hone and I had 3 pieces of meat and almost no been sprouts I was pissed I called and complaining because obviously I was hungry and I wanted more than three pieces of meat she said oh well the chef put the same amount of meat for all of them so I got even more mad nice excuse me I paid for a large you 're telling me that they put the same amount and regardless of the size so why would I be paying for a large and getting a small you 're ripping people off she would n't do anything for me saying I 'm not in control I ca n't do anything next time I 'll just give you more meat I want it was so mad Plus to make matters worse my boyfriend went and walked into the kitchen and it was filthy there was literally a bowl of meat sitting on the floor it was disgusting boy caught it I swear to God I will never ever ever ever again it is disgusting and they are rude and they rip you off I wish I could knew how to delete my old review.</li><li>We were really surprised at the generous amount of side dish from the chef.</li><li>The last 3 times we got Congee Star ( since they have gotten their new chef), the portions have been cut in almost HALF and the price is the SAME.</li><li>It was very apparent that the chef mistakenly put plain rice as oppose to the correct sushi rice.</li><li>I politely informed the waitress of the chef 's mistake only to be given an attitude and a response ... an I quote `` I DON' T THINK SO'' and walked away.</li><li>Called her back and only after a brief conversation did she agree to bring my plate back to the chef for an exchange.</li><li>I can see that her and the chef had an lengthy conversation before remaking my food again.</li><li>While the chef was remaking my plate he too was looking over at our table with an annoyed and dirty look.</li><li>I think the chef has no idea what italian food is about.</li><li>Neither does it offer a world class chef curated menu that you 'd take Anthony Bourdain to in his Toronto stopover.</li><li>However the indian chef knew exactly what I was talking about- woaah! he made it fire.</li><li>It was good but because the chef probably rushed the order the vegetables were uncooked, it wasnt a delight to get a big mouth full of raw onion.</li><li>The highlight of the night is when my spice craving friend repeatedly ordered so much hot sauce for her mango shrimp, the chef, and both of the owners came out in utter astonishment in the amount of red goo she was applying to her entrée.</li><li>The chef makes his rounds non-intrusively table to table to see if his guests are enjoying their food.</li><li>Our waitress revealed that the chef was not Thai but Mexican.</li><li>Every Lamb and Beef dish on this picture friendly menu is AWESOME. go in for a warm lamb stew or chef 's special soup in the winter, or cool garlic cucumbers in the summer. their beef or lamb chinese style pancakes are YUM -- delightfully puffy and filled with perfectly seasoned meat. their house special beef noodle soup is cravable! you can taste the time and love in the soup base. ughh so goooood .. and the hand pulled noodles are as real as they get outside of la chine. seriously ? who cooks like this anymore outside of china ? -- these are classic techniques! the decor is kind of hilarious though, a lil step up from a hole in the wall, it 's definitely clean, but it also feels like you 're in the middle of nowhere china, really really first gen. like you 've escaped the city. and nothing matches. the walls are cheerily painted like you 're walking into the plateaus deep into china, starkly contrasting the leather booths and the crazy yellow seat covers that match the trilingual waitress 's outfits ( they mainly speak mandarin, some canto, and english). the TVs are always playing old 50 's chinese black &amp; white talkies, and there are neon signs boasting great halel food! the chef is usually out and about greeting the customers- he 's won awards for his food, and i agree -- this place is seriously the best regional lamb and beef dishes that 's hit the east side of this city since ... johnny 's burgers. i highly recommend this place! because i 'd be so sad to see it go under because no one knows about it. deserves my YUM YUM approval fo sheezie;).</li><li>Every Lamb and Beef dish on this picture friendly menu is AWESOME. go in for a warm lamb stew or chef 's special soup in the winter, or cool garlic cucumbers in the summer. their beef or lamb chinese style pancakes are YUM -- delightfully puffy and filled with perfectly seasoned meat. their house special beef noodle soup is cravable! you can taste the time and love in the soup base. ughh so goooood .. and the hand pulled noodles are as real as they get outside of la chine. seriously ? who cooks like this anymore outside of china ? -- these are classic techniques! the decor is kind of hilarious though, a lil step up from a hole in the wall, it 's definitely clean, but it also feels like you 're in the middle of nowhere china, really really first gen. like you 've escaped the city. and nothing matches. the walls are cheerily painted like you 're walking into the plateaus deep into china, starkly contrasting the leather booths and the crazy yellow seat covers that match the trilingual waitress 's outfits ( they mainly speak mandarin, some canto, and english). the TVs are always playing old 50 's chinese black &amp;

they should at least invest in some labels.</li><li>It tasted like the chef went to No Frills and bought Mr. Goudas jerk bbq sauce.</li><li>When we checked with the waitress, it seemed that the chef might have forgotten our orders.</li><li>She said that when the chef cooked the beef pho, he put all the food left in the pot into our bowl, so medium became large, and because we ate it, we must pay for the large bowl.</li><li>The staff are friendly as is the chef.</li><li>The waitress went to speak to the chef on staff, and came back to tell us that the chef said their fish is very fresh!</li><li>The waitress went to speak to the chef on staff, and came back to tell us that the chef said their fish is very fresh!</li><li>Probably coz the chef could n't see very well!</li><li>2 star for 1 reason .. poor customer service! i phoned in earlier around 8:30 to placed pick up order and who ever answered the phone said that they 're already closed when they suppose to be open till 9 and she even told me that their chef Does not want to cook anymore.</li><li>The only issue I have with it is the long wait-times for a chef to come to your teppanyaki table. service and quality has gotten worse over the past five years I 've been dining here. sloooow to get items, even when a la carte, no refills on water glasses, wrong order after wrong order.</li><li>The chef was really entertaining but the food was so so.</li><li>And the worst of all, the `` chef'' placed raw chicken right next to cooked fish on the grill, handling with same spatula.</li><li>You sit around a cooking table and a chef comes in introduces himself, and starts cooking with FLARE!</li><li>We 've waited an hour and a half for our food to come, and still have to wait longer for the chef to cook our food.</li><li>The chef attempted to entertain us with jokes, but it an epic failed.</li><li>The chef stands in front of you and give you a really good show with onion volcano and juggling with salt and pepper.</li><li>One was staring at me and hollering at me to get my attention, when he got my attention, the other chef farted as loud as humanly possible.</li><li>Our chef was a young Malaysian guy who knew how to make his audience comfortable drawing us out so that we enjoyed not only his mastery of the grill but also his entertaining patter.</li><li>Any more and it 'd be tight ( or you 'd be staring at the back of the chef).</li><li>This means that we sat there staring at the back of one chef as he started cooking for the opposite table.</li><li>As I sat there watching from behind, I noticed there was very little interaction between the chef and the patrons, as if he were just performing a bored, stolid rehearsed act.</li><li>He got us the chef who he said was the best chef working there.</li><li>He got us the chef who he said was the best chef working there.</li><li>The chef knew how to entertain the 6 year old and even my 85 year old grandpa who is not easily impressed.</li><li>The servers, although really do n't have to do much because the chef does everything, needed to come by more frequently to top of our tea cups, water, and other beverages.</li><li>Without me even asking, the server noticed and asked if I had any allergies and then got a chef to cook with separate ingredients on another iron griddle!</li><li>Other than that, the food is great at the cooking table and every chef serves the same quality of food.</li><li>We waited for close to an hour for their teppanyaki chef to come to our table.</li><li>There were two chefs, the first chef did tricks and was a great host!</li><li>However, when we got the second chef, he did the bare minimum.</li><li>Our chef was a little quiet compared to the others, but still entertaining and friendly.</li><li>Like another poster said, I would have rather had a more entertaining chef though.</li><li>Would com again but just hope I get a more entertaining chef.</li><li>The Benihana-style chef show is good fun.</li><li>The chef took their time my last visit- the egg whites were fluffy yet filling, the puffs were big and poofy, and they were served hot.</li><li>The chef at this location is an OG and trains new chef when there 's an expansion.</li><li>The chef at this location is an OG and trains new chef when there 's an expansion.</li><li>The gentleman who took my order also told me he would heat up the roast beef himself so it would n't take that long and the time before that actually, I ordered the exact same thing without the fries and paid less, however the chef by accident added fries and did n't charge me extra!</li><li>Also, shoutout to the chef who was incredibly engaging and informative.</li><li>He was the Panino Cappucino version of that chef in the movie `` Last Vacation''- taking pride in every dish, eager to inspire our palates with fresh &amp; authentic dishes he encouraged us to indulge, happy to help us along our foodie journey through unexplored Italian territory !!</li><li>I 'm not sure if it is because the cook ( doubtful a chef would work there) did not wash and dry the vegetables properly, but it just tasted slimy.</li><li>The chef eventually came out and told us that a lot of Asians come in and like their salmon raw in center.</li><li>The bill was paid and the chef came out and had words with the party that paid our bill.</li><li>How unprofessional of the chef.</li><li>If the rice is bland and if the chef puts too much rice in the serving then it ruins the sushi experience.</li><li>Maybe they have a different chef on other days ?</li><li>The chef for My Sushi is not a real sushi chef.</li><li>They really need a better chef.</li><li>Great little space; nicely decorated, and you can watch the chef make noodles by hand which is kinda cool.</li><li>The chef is actually Japanese and has been doing this for 30 years.</li><li>Moreover $ 45 for the chef 's choice sushi dinner for only 12 pc was steep- especially when they charge extra for the miso soup.</li><li>When the chef comes out to make the dinner, he uses his cooking tools to keep your attention.</li><li>The chef does n't throw around knives, they are specialists in tossing around the salt and pepper shakers.</li><li>Its a small treat while watching the chef cook your food.</li><li>- At the teppanyaki table, I think the chef did n't really put on as big of a show as I thought.</li><li>Last time I was at Akasaka up at richmond hill, the chef was putting on a big show with every patron at the table.</li><li>Chef was a little low key for Teppanyaki ( which was ok in my mind), there was several types of beef, sushi grade fish etc ...</li><li>For some reason, the chef miscalculated the time to cook the salmon, and the rest of us had our meat long before the salmon was finished ... a good 5- 10 minutes ... which was n't right.</li><li>Finally, when the chef started to bring thing over to the table to get ready to cook, I sought out the waitress and reminded her we were still waiting for appetizers ( over $ 70 worth).</li><li>Not only the chef did a great job in preparation of the meal, the presentation of the food and attending to all customers were done in a timely and professional manner. ( not to mention, It was very entertaining as well- see photos) It 's a little bit pricy but I think it 's very well worth it.</li><li>The chef arrived with our stuff and quickly started to cook.</li><li>The chef was a bit quiet.</li><li>The chef we got was friendly and personable.</li><li>Our chef made a little fire mountain with some sliced up onions and he did cool tricks with the salt and pepper grinder.</li><li>I hope the chef got my tip because our waitress definitely did n't deserve it.</li><li>Our chef was a bit distant and not very engaging compared to similar restaurants I 've been to.</li><li>Overall I 'd say it 's average and expensive for what you get- maybe it would have been more fun with a full restaurant, a big group and a more exciting chef.</li><li>The service is really attentive, at one point we had three people serving us, even the chef came out to say hello!</li><li>Maybe the chef went for a smoke break in between the orders .. the restaurant is near to a tobacco company after all.</li><li>The chef is from Pampanga which are famous filipino cooks.</li><li>I believe the management has changed actually, and maybe even the chef.</li><li>The bad part about this place is n't necessarily with the chef, but with the ingredients they have.</li><li>It is kind of sad in that the chef prepared the dish very well already, they were just stuck with bad supplies.</li><li>When we arrived the chef was out grocery shopping so we had to wait 20 minutes till they came back which we did n't mind.</li><li>The chef was certainly Japanese, dressed in hat and all.</li><li>The only disappointing thing was the teppanyaki chef, normally when you have a teppanyaki lunch/dinner the chef usually puts on a small show to entertain the guests but our chef made it seem like it was a chore for him and did n't seem like he had much experience in entertaining guests.</li><li>The only disappointing thing was the teppanyaki chef, normally when you have a teppanyaki lunch/dinner the chef usually puts on a small show to entertain the guests but our chef made it seem like it was a chore for him and did n't seem like he had much experience in entertaining guests.</li><li>Love to meet the creative chef that came up with this complex dish that it ca n't be modified.</li><li>I 'm a chef of a busier restaurant in the financial district and if any guest of mine asked for any modification it would be done and if my cooks ca n't handle that in a rush they would be fired.</li><li>Went here a couple of times Pricey for what you are paying for There is only so much all you can eat stir fry one can eat Good selection of fresh food for the stirfry you are creating I think this place is more for the experience Getting to watch a teppan chef cook your food is essentially what you are paying for Nothing special but would go again.</li><li>You walk around with a bowl, place in some meat, vegetables, sauces, garnishes, etc and pass it to a chef who takes your bowl and cooks it all on a HUGE table stove in front of you in a minute and passes it right back to you.</li><li>She was even kind enough to carry it over to the grill and hand it to the chef.</li><li>Once at the grill itself the chef first scrapes off the caked on charcoal of past delicacies from your designated grill area.</li><li>Then the chef throws your bowl of assorted num-nums onto the grill and proceeds to move it around with what looks like a very large wooden chopstick.</li><li>I found it very annoying that I had to wait for everyone food to be prepared separately ( it 's a big grill, cook 2 meals at a time or more, its already prepared for the chef all he has to do is stir it and dump it onto a plate. ( it takes 2 minutes on average per plate so as the 5th in line ( someone was ahead of us) it was a good 10 minutes before he got to me).</li><li>Do n't know the name but their main thing is a build your own dish ( pick from a large assortment of veggies, meats and sauces give to chef who cooks it for you on this 6-8 for wide circular flat top stove) which is incredible ... and the food too.</li><li>You can put as many different ingredients as your want into a bowl, and then the chef will cook it on top of this huge circular iron stove top!</li><li>The flavour choices were delicious and I was content not being a chef for a night.</li><li>You take a bowl and load it up with protein, veggies, rice or noodles, and a ladle of sauce, and then you give it to the chef who stir-fries it on a huge flat teppan-table thing.</li><li>However would have preferred to have more selection of desserts ... the place and atmosphere is comforting .... plus you fet to watch the chef cooking in action with those gigantic looking chopsticks haha Definitely a place to come back to ....</li><li>They get to make their food and we test their food in the master chef style.</li><li>I like how you can make your own dish and have the chef cook your dish ....</li><li>The chef was quiet but energetic.</li><li>It was the same thing, only this time the servers and chef all seemed slow and depressed to be there.</li><li>After placing my order, i waited not long and chef brought it out.</li><li>Korean staff and chef.</li><li>The side of spicy pickled daikon is a nice touch to cleanse the palate and cut some of the grease. if you are uptown and want ramen, Kenzo is your best ramen place to satisfy that noodle craving. although the establishment is korean run, the chef trained in japan on ramen and you will get an honest japanese style ramen from here. they dont have a really huge menu, but it is quality over quantity.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
