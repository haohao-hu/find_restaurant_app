<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 6714' %><h2>mash potato side dish<br />occurrence: 1</h2><div><ol><li>Hearty comfort food for me! n the mash potato side dish is so yummy too! towards the end when u only have a bit of chicken n pieces of veggies left in ur pan, you can ask them to make fried rice with it. they will bring over rice, hot sauce/sesame oil mixture n mix it all up for u. the owner lady even formed the rice into a heart shape for me n my boyfriend one time. it was too cute ~! the Dak Gal Bee is so good there, every time we go that 's all we get. so i do n't know how the other items on the menu taste. oh and the minimum order for Dak Gal Bee is 2 people portions. service is fine, waitresses are pleasant, but sometimes do n't speak much English, but who cares, food 's good!</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
