<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1097' %><h2>bubble teas<br />occurrence: 3</h2><div><ol><li>It 's still a cute place to hang out w/ friends though. service, food, everything was great--especially the atmosphere. super cosy and easily my ( and many of my friends ') favourite cafe in the area try out the cinnamon honey brick bread and their bingsoo! this is the only cafe so far in toronto that serves shaved milk ( instead of regular water which makes it extra creamy and delicious). their servings are always very large so going with a friend is recommended but not necessary. if you 're looking for drinks, their sweet potato latte is the best I 've had in toronto and as for cold drinks, all of their bubble teas are very nice would definitely recommend to try out for anyone in the area.</li><li>Their bubble teas are cheap and yummy.</li><li>Came in to get 2 bubble teas.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
