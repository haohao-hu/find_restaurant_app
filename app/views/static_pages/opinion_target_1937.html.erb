<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1937' %><h2>eggplant sandwich<br />occurrence: 2</h2><div><ol><li>I will definitely be coming back here !!! arviderci Paolo see you soon! this is a really cute place close to my neighborhood, my boyf and i decided to come here after i read some good yelp reviews ( id seen the place before but never got around to actually trying it). the service was so friendly and he gave us 2 coffees for the price of one which was very sweet. i love the decor and music, its very old-timey. i ordered a chicken sandwich and he ordered an eggplant sandwich, which is vegetarian, and they were really good, my only gripe would be that the bread is a bit dry. otherwise its a really nice little place with reasonable prices.</li><li>They have an eggplant sandwich for $ 3.99 which I am looking forward to trying!</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
