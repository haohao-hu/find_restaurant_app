Korean food.</li><li>As soon as I sat down, I decided Korean food was n't what I wanted.</li><li>The reason for that is because it 's not particularly cheap, especially considering that there 's so much good Korean food on Yonge for cheaper.</li><li>It 's pretty damn spicy and yes, you smell like you showered in the sauce after- but you just have to deal with it if you want to experience good Korean food!</li><li>Spicy Korean food is my definition of comfort food.</li><li>The prices were average for Korean food, the soups/stews ranged from $ 6.99- $ 9.99 and there were also options for hot pot and table top cooking.</li><li>The food is one of the best Korean food I have had, every thing was made perfect!</li><li>Given the fact that I am a huge fan of Korean food, and always ready to try new Korean restaurants, I am pretty confident to say that Chowon Family Restaurant serves top-notch Korean food at an unbelievably price.</li><li>This place is very reasonable for delicious Korean food.</li><li>If it 's not out of convenience for me, I would prefer venturing down to Yonge and Finch for better Korean food options ( at a tad better price points).</li><li>More unique Korean food- mainly bring the big sizzling plate- which tastes great especially with cheese and noodle add on, but is n't very good value for money, as it is minimum two portions.</li><li>Good Korean food- the dak gal bee was good and the rice cakes with noodles made it delicious.</li><li>Not a place to go for fancy decor or attentive service, but good if you want to grab a quick bite of authentic Korean food ( if you 've been to Korea: it 's like any of the millions of low-end diners around, which is n't a bad thing).</li><li>Galleria has much more authentic korean food and the price is less then half of Joon 's.</li><li>Ordered: Porkbelly BBQ ( Sam Kyup Sal)* Pork belly BBQ served with mushrooms, onions and veggies for wrapping* You cook this on a BBQ grill at your table* Served with green onions and you can add it to your ' ssam' Green onions with chili powder and some vinegar for you to eat with the grilled meat Ordered: Marinated Beef ( Ju Mul Luk)* Beef mixed with veggies in a sweet sauce* I much prefer this over Bulgogi which I find it to be too sweet* This you also cook at your table with the grill Ordered: Kimchi Stew ( KimChi JjiGae)* It was interesting to see vermicelli in a Kimchi stew* The soup was just spicy enough and not too sour* Usually you eat this with a bowl of rice Ordered: Dumplings ( Mandoo)* These were Mul-Mandoo which means it is cooked in boiling water* You dip this into soy sauce Ordered: Spicy Soup ( Jjam Ppong Tang)* This is usually a noodle dish but this specific one was made without for drinking* It makes a nice dish to order when you are drinking soju* Filled with seafood and veggies Ordered: Seafood Pancake ( Hae Mul Pa Jeon)* There was n't much seafood in the pancake* I did n't really enjoy this Ordered: Spicy octopus &amp; pork* This is a table top cooking with veggies, octopus and pork* You can adjust the spiciness of this dish* Usually comes in 2 portions but we added an extra serving* Because there was so much food it did take a while to cook Conclusion: Now that I 've been back 3 times and tried couple things off their menu, I am convinced that even from their never-ending menu- they serve good Korean food.</li><li>I desperately had to find a replacement for my mom 's homemade korean food and thank goodness that Oh Geul Boh Geul is literally steps away from our condo!</li><li>Not the best Korean food I 've had but the portions

purposely come here if I wanted good korean food.</li><li>What that has to do with Korean comfort food served in a diner-like setting is beyond me- perhaps the food is meant to make you smarter or

price.</li><li>I always recommend people who wants to try real authentic Korean food.</li><li>It was like he was belittling us, as if non-Koreans ca n't handle `` authentic'' Korean food.</li><li>He

I 'd give it a go.</li><li>My poor coworker, who does n't seem to have much lunch when coming out with me for Korean food, did n't like her rice at all and I must say, it did n't look overly appetizing either.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
