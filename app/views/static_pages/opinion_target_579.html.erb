<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 579' %><h2>sushi place<br />occurrence: 6</h2><div><ol><li>Admittedly, this is n't the best sushi place, but the quality-to-price ratio exceeded all expectations.</li><li>We were both stuffed by the end of the meal, but already thinking about who we were going to bring on our next visit to try more items on their menu ~ Prices are more than the average sushi place, but for service, atmosphere and quality of food I would say you definitely get what you pay for ~ This time, we arrived for a late night sushi craving after finishing off Christmas shopping and Sushi Moto really did a great job.</li><li>A good sushi place is defined by their sushi quality first.</li><li>The negatives: Nasty customers who know how to destroy a pleasant ambience- have their speaker-phones on their cell phones ( loudly) in a quiet sushi place.</li><li>Solid sushi place and the prices were definitely on par with most other places.</li><li>Otherwise, Genji is great, and would be a very cute date idea!* Note: I was not on a date, but this little restaurant had some vibes going f It 's an ok sushi place- not the best, not the worst.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
