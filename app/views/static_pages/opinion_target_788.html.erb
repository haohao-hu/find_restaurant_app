<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 788' %><h2>hot food<br />occurrence: 5</h2><div><ol><li>This restaurant is located in a small foodcourt in the basement of 5700 Yonge St. There were about 4 hot food choices as well as a sandwich and salad station.</li><li>The color was kind of off- all sashimi had a warm taste and it was covered in water- it just did n't taste pleasant, we ordered a second round of sashimi .. same thing Rolls- Our roll order was forgotten on the FIRST ticket .. mmm .. we ordered their signature roll .. it was really meh .... and the nori was chewy handroll- the Nori was very soft when it came ... portion of rice to filling .. rice more .. filling a bit .. no good Hot Food- beef roll enoki, and green onions, short ribs, grilled shrimp, grilled cutlet, grilled mushroom, grilled beef, grilled chicken heart, etc etc ( The shrimp did not taste fresh again) but overall the beef were all pretty good! ( or 2nd order some of the grill items were once again forgotten !!!! they were n't even full for the evening !!)</li><li>The hot food was alrighr too.</li><li>I like the food here; its hot food is especially good, sashimi pieces are large, and the menu has a great deal of variety.</li><li>While I was waiting i was checking out all the hot food items they had displayed in chafing pans behind the glass and i must say everything looked fresh, home-made and very appetising.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
