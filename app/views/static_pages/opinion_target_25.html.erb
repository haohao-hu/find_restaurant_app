<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 25' %><h2>sashimi<br />occurrence: 282</h2><div><ol><li>Kalbi and sashimi are awesome.</li><li>I normally get a bulgogi dinner box which comes with sashimi, dynamite rolls, rice, bulgogi, green salad, miso soup, potato and chap chae for $ 11.95.</li><li>How hard is it to cut 15 pieces of sashimi ?</li><li>I requested that the sashimi and the rolls all be salmon.</li><li>I gotta say its a different experience to have sashimi without tea, didnt really like it.</li><li>The salmon sashimi use to be pretty decent but today I felt like the sashimi was freezer burnt.</li><li>16 dollars .. i am a sushi lover and i have been to many if not almost all the ayce sushi places in GTA ... i can tell you this place cuts the THINNEST sashimi i have ever seen. salmon is transparent ..</li><li>The Sashimi Haru was a boat of sashimi that must 've been sitting since atleast lunch.</li><li>You can choose from your sashimi, maki rolls, tempura, cooked items, rice, noodles etc.</li><li>Other sashimi is mediocre.</li><li>I ordered a chirashi don which is basically sashimi on rice.</li><li>I have to say the sashimi tasted really low quality, and for some odd reason by scallop and sweet shrimp looks half cook or that something has cooking it.</li><li>The color was kind of off- all sashimi had a warm taste and it was covered in water- it just did n't taste pleasant, we ordered a second round of sashimi .. same thing Rolls- Our roll order was forgotten on the FIRST ticket .. mmm .. we ordered their signature roll .. it was really meh .... and the nori was chewy handroll- the Nori was very soft when it came ... portion of rice to filling .. rice more .. filling a bit .. no good Hot Food- beef roll enoki, and green onions, short ribs, grilled shrimp, grilled cutlet, grilled mushroom, grilled beef, grilled chicken heart, etc etc ( The shrimp did not taste fresh again) but overall the beef were all pretty good! ( or 2nd order some of the grill items were once again forgotten !!!! they were n't even full for the evening !!)</li><li>No sashimi at lunch, but at least the amount of rice in a sushi wasnt that much.</li><li>Chirashi don ( $ 15.95)- assorted sashimi on rice ( served with salad and miso soup).</li><li>Pieces of sashimi were quite small.</li><li>We ordered room temperature sashimi ( not by choice), and for some odd reason the salmon came in two different shades of orange, I guess evening patrons get leftover cuts ?</li><li>Many places I have been to I do n't mind eating the sashimi ( ichiban, takara bune) but here you really enjoy the salmon tuna and hamachi ... if you go to ayce sushi places and think ur eating good sushi you are definitely not ....</li><li>I had a selection of appetizers, sushi, sashimi and a spider roll.</li><li>I had the lunch sushi and sashimi special and I thought it was great- all the pieces were fresh and proportions were big enough to fill me up for lunch.</li><li>Spider roll was novice, the sashimi was fresh but so what ?</li><li>The sashimi was cut thinly.</li><li>The sashimi is good here.</li><li>Ca n't expect too much expensive sashimi haha!</li><li>My brother ordered the Sashimi dinner for $ 19.95 and it included 18 pieces of sashimi of which 8 pieces were salmon.</li><li>The sashimi is indeed fresh, but I 'm not sure what I 'm paying extra for ..</li><li>The tempura and sashimi are delicious.</li><li>I ordered 2 things: Sashimi Dinner ( $ 19.99) that includes 18 pieces sashimi, rice, soup, and salad and 2 pieces of Otoro sushi ( $ 19.99).</li><li>The sashimi sushi maki combo included some big pieces of sashimi, but the rolls ( spicy salmon &amp; spicy tuna) were just disgusting.</li><li>The sashimi and sushi combo sets offer a wide selection of fresh fish and the presentation speaks for itself in these photos.</li><li>Their sashimi small- one of the best values ever- generous portion and various, high end cut fish!</li><li>The sashimi is fresh and delicious.</li><li>All the way from the miso soup, salad, all the way to the sushi and sashimi.</li><li>The sashimi is some of the freshest I 've had in Toronto.</li><li>I managed to keep my bill under $ 15 and have a descent mix of sushi rolls and sashimi.</li><li>I 'd love to go back and try more of their a la carte pieces. very fresh sashimi.</li><li>Uni sashimi is very strong but I guess that 's how it is.</li><li>The slices of sashimi were a really generous thickness and the ones with the rice there was more fish than rice which was great.</li><li>The boat was $ 98.95 which included 45 pieces of sashimi, 26 pieces of nigri sushi and 24 pieces of maki.</li><li>The sashimi was really fresh and the rolls were a bit smaller-sized but they tasted great.</li><li>We ordered the small sashimi set, 2 specialty rolls and a hamachi appetizer and we were decently full, but not stuffed.</li><li>Everything is always fresh and amazing with consistent quality- I 've never once put a piece of sashimi in my mouth that tasted even the slightest bit `` off'' here.</li><li>It costs less than some other sashimi combos but offers the same amount of fish, if not more ( I 've never been able to finish the whole meal)- and the variety of sashimi included is outstanding!</li><li>I got a sashimi dinner, a selection of a la carte sashimi, beef sashimi, and several rolls.</li><li>Beef sashimi was terrible- dried out with out flavour .... tasted like the ones from AYCE.</li><li>Quality of the a la carte sashimi was better, since you 're paying a lot more!</li><li>The sashimi was okay, the roll was okay.</li><li>The sushi pizza, sashimi, bulgogi beef and onion platter were all excellent.</li><li>The sashimi arrived on a bed of nicely done seasoned rice.</li><li>For the main we shared a sashimi and sushi platter combo.</li><li>I thought to myself that maybe their cooked dishes just was n't their forte and that their sashimi and rolls would make up for it.</li><li>When the sashimi platter came, it looked pretty decent, but as you tasted it, there was no freshness to the fish, and it was on par with AYCE sashimi ( if that).</li><li>The sashimi was so fresh, the presentation was spectacular and the service was personalized and so on point.</li><li>I only got the bento box though, do n't know if i 'll come back to try their sashimi.</li><li>We opted for the combination sushi platter with sashimi and everything was incredibly fresh.</li><li>Came here to try more of their sashimi for dinner.</li><li>We ordered the sashimi platter which comes with 10 assorted sashimi.</li><li>We ordered four rolls and the small sashimi.</li><li>The sashimi was OK but the rolls were pretty awesome.</li><li>Woah I 'm stuffed. the manager and servers are very friendly and attentive. we tried toro ( bluefin tuna) sashimi, and it tasted so good. it 's just very pricey ( $ 19.95, usually $ 24.95). i ordered chirasu lunch ( rice with various kinds of sashimi) as main course and all the sashimi were very fresh and well served. would definitely go back there again to try their sushi combo.</li><li>Woah I 'm stuffed. the

assorted sashimi and it tasted fresh.</li><li>The sashimi especially is very fresh and cut perfectly.</li><li>Salmon sashimi is the best.</li><li>The small sashimi, which is enough for 2-3 people depending on how piggish you feel, is $ 38.</li><li>Same story about with the sashimi pieces.</li><li>The quality of sushi and sashimi is simply a cut above your average sushi place.</li><li>However, we got the platter where it 's supposed to be sashimi dipped in flavouring sauce, but tasted literally just like sashimi.</li><li>We ordered sashimi platter for 2 ppl and the quality is not bad at all for 50 bucks.</li><li>Main entree course ( sushi and sashimi) was prepared in advance and left to sit on top of the cooler, as opposed to inside of it.</li><li>I always get the sushi, sashimi, and maki boats, which is great if you want to try many different types of fish.</li><li>Especially loved the sashimi and the handrolls are just bomb, then again, I do love me any type of sushi and its the closest one to my house so that 's a definite plus.</li><li>I thought service was ok. disgusting. absolute shit. it taste horrible and the amount of rice they put on sushi to make you full faster ... and how thin their sashimi is ... oh did i mention that its overpriced ? the waitress is an asshole with attitude ... the manager is an asshole with attitude. horrible service. you have to pay extra for parking as well ... they wont validate it for more than an hour even though they take forever to make their food. i swear they do that on purpose ... fucking ridiculous.</li><li>I will say it did put a downer how dessert cost an extra $ 3 and sashimi was also an added cost.</li><li>I find most places that do n't do AYCE normally do charge extra for sashimi but still = ( was a tad disappointed!</li><li>The sashimi looks like it was hacked away with using a dull knife and the slices are so small.</li><li>I was impressed by the sashimi.</li><li>Other sashimi were sliced in typical sashimi slices like at regular sushi restaurants.</li><li>They have sashimi, for some reason the menu says that you can only order 5 pieces per person but I always order more and that seems to be on with the staff.</li><li>The only one I find worth going back to is Kiyomizu- especially if you are a sashimi person.</li><li>The food: 10/10 Their sashimi are always fresh.</li><li>Quality sashimi balanced by tasteful cooked plates, beautifully arranged plates, beautiful ambience, extensive ETOH menu, and charming chef and waitress.</li><li>Sushi and sashimi were awesome.</li><li>For the sashimi, they were really fresh and tasty!</li><li>It is a relatively peaceful and serene dining environment which is nice when you are savouring well-cut, well-prepared sashimi.</li><li>Some of my sashimi came frozen.</li><li>It cooked my raw sashimi.</li><li>DO order the rolls and the sashimi, the fish tastes fresh and you get good value for the price paid.</li><li>Overall a good experience since the sashimi was done really well and the staff there were so friendly and welcoming.</li><li>Comes with around 9 pieces of sashimi, a tempura shrimp and some seaweed salad.</li><li>I ordered `` Take'' which includes 12 assorted types of nigiri sushi ( sashimi on rice) w/ 3 California rolls.</li><li>Super fresh sashimi!</li><li>Their rolls are light on the rice and their sashimi is very fresh.</li><li>Everything else like the sushi, sashimi, chicken terriyaki were terrible in my bento box I had for lunch they did n't look or taste fresh.</li><li>We split the assorted regular sashimi which came with salmon, tuna, surf clam, and some sort of white fish.</li><li>The sashimi has suffered a little bit of a set back as they do not serve the infamous squid sashimi anymore as it is one of the pricier fishes.</li><li>And it is both tasty and pretty to look at! + 1 star The Bad:- The Sashimi Medium ( $ 35.95) though looks so massive and nicely presented in a boat, it is the most horrible sashimi I ever ate ...</li><li>And it is both tasty and pretty to look at! + 1 star The Bad:- The Sashimi Medium ( $ 35.95) though looks so massive and nicely presented in a boat, it is the most horrible sashimi I ever ate ...</li><li>We ordered a boat and it came with sushi, sashimi and a California roll.</li><li>The sashimi had salmon, red tuna and white tuna, which was average like all other typical Japanese places.</li><li>It had a mix of salmon and tuna ( I think) sashimi overtop lettuce, beets, avocado and a mix of other vegatbles and nori.</li><li>Since we were in a hurry we decided to order the sashimi wasakawa and the beef dumpling rice cake soup to go.</li><li>Besides the usual sashimi slices of salmon, tuna, and tai, there were also warm saucy unagi slices and mini nigiri of spicy tuna mixed with crunchy tempura bits all laid out scrumptiously on a bed of sweet and vinegary warm rice.</li><li>The sushi and sashimi were fresh and very well prepared.</li><li>It has a variety of small plates ( soup and salad, sushi, sashimi, tempura, ginger chicken, terriyaki beef or salmon, terriyaki veggies, fried rice or udon, etc) for twenty something dollars.</li><li>They have really unique options like bitter melon, chicken heart skewers, and for sashimi, they have scallops which is awesome!</li><li>The sashimi is really fresh and the food quality overall is very good.</li><li>The chicken heart skewers are damn good, and the sashimi ai n't too shabby either.</li><li>The big reasons are as follows: The AYCE MENU is big Scallop sashimi is a plus Beef tataki!</li><li>Salmon sashimi is thick!</li><li>We ordered a lot of scallop and sweet shrimp sashimi!</li><li>Some of the things that stood out from their menu: scallop sashimi ( diced to small pieces) and steamed egg.</li><li>The sashimi, especially the salmon, was sliced in such chunky pieces I felt like I was eating a raw piece of salmon filet instead of sashimi.</li><li>The sashimi, especially the salmon, was sliced in such chunky pieces I felt like I was eating a raw piece of salmon filet instead of sashimi.</li><li>The food &amp; selection ( 4.5/5): Sashimi was fresh, the cooked meat was alright, but the rolls were definitely well done in terms of flavour and rice vs. Fish ratio: P A couple things of reasons why I thought this place differed from many other AYCE.</li><li>Also, I love the smaller pieced sashimi because it 's more bite size and honestly, all you need to do is order more if you did n't have enough, I do n't see it as much of a problem ..</li><li>The food was really bad, the sashimi was doused in a citrus sauce that tasted like licking an orange peel.</li><li>Although the lunch buffet price is half of dinner and there seemed to be over 75 + items listed, nothing but the dinner only items stood out ( no sashimi for lunch), I personally would n't make my money worth by coming here for lunch.</li><li>Able to.maintain the food quality, very attended staff, friendly, service in good standard, sashimi is always fresh, sushi rolls has the right portion of rice, weekends they serve scallop sashimi, spicy tuna hand roll, variety of good quality sashimi choices. reasonable priced and dessert is average.</li><li>Able to.maintain the food quality, very attended staff, friendly, service in good standard, sashimi is always fresh,

will be charged dinner price if you want to eat sashimi at lunch time.</li><li>If I 'm coming back again, it would be for dinner because there is no sashimi for lunch.</li><li>The sashimi is average, the slices are little too thin in terms of the salmon.</li><li>I know it is ayce but a slice of sashimi that is too thin, basically meanst hat the sashimi will not have the texture feel that makes it good.</li><li>I know it is ayce but a slice of sashimi that is too thin, basically meanst hat the sashimi will not have the texture feel that makes it good.</li><li>Their sauced beef/salmon sashimi is amazing.</li><li>It has the standard fare of sashimi, rolls, hot foods, cold apps, dessert and drinks, just as it does with forgetful service and not serving you 100% of what you asked for.</li><li>Just no any other place would beat their quality foods. the sashimi are fresh and the hot foods are above average. this place is always packed, but soon you will notice it is worth the wait after you taste their foods. if they would have more selection of sakes that will be perfect as i am a sake lover: -p.</li><li>The sashimi is always cut properly portioned well and they have good offerings.</li><li>The sashimi and desserts are good too!</li><li>So when I try out a new AYCE place, I judge it based on the quality of the sashimi, and the variety of sashimi and sushi.</li><li>So when I try out a new AYCE place, I judge it based on the quality of the sashimi, and the variety of sashimi and sushi.</li><li>The quality of the sashimi at Sushi Legend was pretty standard for an AYCE restaurant.</li><li>Super fast service, nice ambience and the sashimi was delicious!</li><li>I wanted to like this place and to be quite honest I do n't think I can rate it fairly when I was n't able to try dinner as I currently have a bun in my oven ... seemed pointless to go for dinner when I ca n't eat the best part ... sashimi.</li><li>The sashimi here is really fresh and salmon was nice thick pieces which I do n't usually see at AYCE places.</li><li>The prices are a little high but it 's worth it if you like sashimi.</li><li>Includes everything like pop and dessert EXCEPT sashimi ( that 's only for dinner buffet).</li><li>For the price increase they should offer sashimi at lunch but they do n't.</li><li>I keep coming back because of the sashimi, the reasonable AYCE price for seniors, and the warm welcome from the staff.</li><li>There are several kitchen items that I like, however, my main food focus is on the special rolls and the sashimi.</li><li>The sashimi and maki were fresh, and the kitchen items tasted great!</li><li>The sashimi and sushi rolls are really fresh, and just leaves you wanting more.</li><li>I go to Sushi Legend about once a month for the sashimi.</li><li>Service is quick and friendly. went for lunch before and went again for dinner, the sashimi were fresh and thick cut the way they are suppose to be and the beef and the scallop sashimi was delishhhhhh !!!</li><li>The special rolls were nice ( ordered mango tango, crazy dragon, black dragon, soft shell crab) but then they fill you up quite quickly so I suggest to fill up on the good stuff ( sashimi and such) first before getting too much of the rolls.</li><li>Beef tataki sashimi, herb tuna sashimi or something like that, maguro hand roll .. actually hand roll because there 's too much rice, scallop sashimi- ordered ONE and it came out as a small plate unlike how the rest of the sashimi is served.</li><li>Beef tataki sashimi, herb tuna sashimi or something like that, maguro hand roll .. actually hand roll because there 's too much rice, scallop sashimi- ordered ONE and it came out as a small plate unlike how the rest of the sashimi is served.</li><li>The sashimi was very fresh, but it was sliced very small; they are too small by standards of both AYCE and a la carte restaurants.</li><li>Overall, this AYCE serves good quality sashimi, sushi, rolls and grills.</li><li>When the second batch of sashimi came, after eating into the 3rd/4th piece, I 've noticed BLOOD in my sashimi.</li><li>At that point, I was quit upset &amp; had lost my appetite all together, I 'd replied back in a loud enough voice so tables around me can hear `` I dont care whether it 's fish blood or human blood; Sashimi should not have blood in it'' Both my partner &amp; I didnt feel good afterwards whether it 's the raw egg or the blood in the sashimi.</li><li>Fresh sashimi, non soggy sushi and good variety of appetizers. most importantly, the only AYCE i know that has scallop sashimi!</li><li>The sashimi and specialty rolls were all fresh and delicious.</li><li>There is a wide selection of sashimi, sushi, seared sushi, cooked ( pan fried) plates, tempura, grilled meats, soups, salad, and dessert.</li><li>The sashimi was fresh, and the other dishes were yummy!</li><li>Listen, their sashimi is fresh as always, the sushi is always on point, the cooked items are flavored to perfection, and the salads are better than most.</li><li>We ordered so much of the sashimi- it was delicious !!</li><li>I would have been happier if they had some sashimi during lunch or if nigiri fish pieces were n't served paper-thin.</li><li>The sushi pieces were warm and the sashimi tasted fine.</li><li>The AYCE menu is pretty long- lots of options between sashimi, sushi and hot food.</li><li>We had quite a variety- sushi, sashimi, tempura, beef ribs and enoki mushrooms wrapped in beef.</li><li>Other than a few `` house'' rolls and sashimi, the menu is n't that restricted for lunch.</li><li>$ 24.95 for a weekend dinner, which features an extended menu with more expensive items ( sashimi, scallop sushi, sake mussels, soft-shell crab roll, etc).</li><li>From bean curd soup, pork katsu, sushi, sashimi, kalbi, bulgogi, bento boxes, amazing tempura Udon and much much more. + + + + the atmosphere is cozy and quiet despite being right beside Sheppard ave. Great friendly service from this Korean owned restaurant!</li><li>We each ordered a bento box and an order of sashimi ( why go to a sushi place and not order any ?).</li><li>The sashimi was clearly defrosted, as required by law, but the freezing was not to the detriment of how delicate and fresh-tasting the fish was.</li><li>Perfect mix of sashimi, rice and some interesting little sides.</li><li>This is one of those worst place to have sashimi and sushi.</li><li>I 've been here more than 10 times for sashimi, maki, hand rolls and Ha Da Bap ( the sashimi with lettuce and seaweed on rice).</li><li>Ordered the lobster sashimi special, the unagi Don and sashimi salad, the sashimi salad was somewhat mediocre, lots of vegetables and not too much sashimi, the Unagi Don lunch special was tiny, and lobster sashimi was kind of too moist .. overall an average lunch experience.</li><li>It 's so easy to opt for something better in North York, so do yourself a favour. food was ok, I know the sashimi is usually fresh and service is quite good usually.</li><li>We had sashimi, sushi and maki rolls.</li><li>The sashimi is fresh.</li><li>I got assorted sashimi, philadelphia rolls, fantastic roll ( torched Salmon with asparagus) and dynamite rolls.</li><li>The sashimi is thick and fresh and the rolls were delicious.</li><li>I judge an AYCE place by the quality of their sashimi.</li><li>Their sashimi did not taste fresh, tuna seemed light yellow in colour and the salmon did not have an oily complexion or buttery taste.</li><li>It 's immediately obvious that the sashimi and sushi are not fresh or the best quality; in fact, the white fish must 've been previously frozen judging by the spongey texture.</li><li>Got the gold menu since we want the sashimi and extra stuff.</li><li>Lastly, taste-wise, the sushi, sashimi, rolls and beef steaks were decent at best.</li><li>I do not believe this place is opened by Japanese, but their sushi and sashimi were actually not bad.</li><li>The Tuna Tataki ( Sashimi) was well done as well.</li><li>I chose the gold menu, which includes the sashimi and some additional premium items, and it all was passable, if just a notch below competitors like Yoshiko and Matsuda, etc.for the same price.</li><li>So if by the unregretable choice you find yourself here order the sashimi and makis nothing else.</li><li>The quality of the sashimi was quite good and the sizes of the rolls are just right.</li><li>Other AYCE sushi restaurants will give you proper sushi and Miso Soup, for an even lower price ( 11.99 on most places for weekday lunch hours). bf and i came here last Sunday afternoon and had the gold menu for AYCE. it was less than average especially for the price, $ 21.99 on weekends and holidays and does not include drinks except for water and tea. this is the only AYCE place that comes out with our order of sashimi last. the most disappointing part was the food. salmon sushi were huge and sliced in cubes, steak cubes came in bits and pieces but was decent, buttered mushrooms were burnt, masago was too salty due to low quality, beef tataki was not fresh, i think the kalbi ribs were old cause they were so chewy i couldnt chew through them, spider roll was the worst! i couldnt even drink the tea cause the cups had such a strong bleach scent. needless to say, we will not be returning and would not recommend it to anyone.</li><li>Beef sashimi was frozen.</li><li>Did not have problems with the sashimi however on TWO separate occasions, the fish in the salmon maki was spoiled ... had an eerie colour of Plasticine ... the type you played with whilst in kindergarten .... tasted like it too ... my friend was peeing out of his butt after one episode.</li><li>Instead, the sashimi looked like trail ends and leftover chunks of scrap ( untrimmed with the grey parts intact, and not sliced in ' sashimi fashion' but rather in actual chunks like what you 'd feed your dog as scraps).</li><li>For a little over $ 10 there 's no where else in the city I know of that you can get 18 pieces of sashimi!</li><li>Their sashimi is fresh, and I love the specials that they offer ( sushi bong special and chirashi are my favourites).</li><li>$ 10 for a box of 18 pieces of sashimi ?</li><li>I only tried the Bong 's sashimi and the avocado roll while my friends got the Sushi Special A and the Bong 's sashimi too.</li><li>I only tried the Bong 's sashimi and the avocado roll while my friends got the Sushi Special A and the Bong 's sashimi too.</li><li>The avocado roll was standard but the box of sashimi was quite satisfying.</li><li>I 've had better sashimi but with a price like that, you 'll be pleased because I certainly was!</li><li>The sashimi tasted fresh, good quality and the rolls were great, it 'll definitely satisfy your craving.</li><li>For this price I guess they should get 5 stars, but because I prefer better/ fresher sashimi I really ca n't see myself coming back.</li><li>I recommend the Dynamite roll ( it 's huge) and their $ 10 assorted sashimi option.</li><li>They have this sashimi special where it 's 18 pieces for less than 10 dollars.</li><li>The sashimi tends to have mostly salmon, but the quality is very good so i do n't mind.</li><li>Overall, great place to get sushi, sashimi and rolls takeout.</li><li>If you are looking for ultimate value combo I suggest getting sashimi from Taro and Pairing them with the rolls from here.</li><li>We ordered the largest party tray and it had every single roll stuffed with cucumbers and avocados, on top of the sashimi and tempura of course.</li><li>I loved the hard Rock and roll, black dragon looked really cool, and the sushi bong special was a really good deal for the amount of sushi and sashimi you could get!</li><li>The Bong 's sashimi is rediculous.</li><li>For $ 8 something there was a big selection including two very big pieces of sashimi.</li><li>Magnifico. was introduced to this place by my bro. if i need a quick sushi fix on the way downtown or coming back up ill usually stop by this place because its awesome. ive heard mixed reviews about their sashimi but i cant comment on that because ive only ever gotten rolls .. and let me tell u they do not disappoint! the rolls are huge with tons of filling as opposed to places that make rolls with tons of rice and totally gimp out on filling. they are VERY busy during weekdays so u might hve to wait ( prepare yourself). not a good place to dine in ... i would recommend take-out ( they literally have like 2 tables) Amazing rolls for a great price ( 1 spider roll and 1 dynamite roll come to just under $ 20 but thy are so big that 2 rolls fill up a box).</li><li>I wonder if they 're sashimi would be as good since variety is limited for what they serve.</li><li>The sashimi was pretty gross mostly because of the giant cuts of tilapia, felt like i was eating cuts of raw tilapia steaks and the salmon tasted a little fishy and the white tuna/butterfish was a whole lot fishier.</li><li>The White Tuna roll was good but was n't great; hope it was n't the same used in the sashimi.</li><li>Their sashimi is fresh.</li><li>So wo n't be buying the sashimi again just because of that fiasco.</li><li>We had a selection of sashimi, my fav the spicy tuna roll and some chicken terriyaki and gyoza.</li><li>The sashimi was quite fresh, I admit.</li><li>The sashimi is pretty fresh however, the quality is not the high-end japanese raw fish!</li><li>Although some people might have reservations about eating raw fish ( sashimi), there 's nothing to worry about here; the sashimi is consistently very high quality and impeccably cleaned.</li><li>Although some people might have reservations about eating raw fish ( sashimi), there 's nothing to worry about here; the sashimi is consistently very high quality and impeccably cleaned.</li><li>I 'd say that most of the Japanese items on their menu are pretty much safe choices -- you 'll want to try their udon and sashimi.</li><li>Cost is $ 28 and comes with a Dragon Roll, assorted Sashimi, fried rice, miso, salad, chicken teryiaki, and shrimp/veg tempura, and ice cream.</li><li>We intended to get a party tray for $ 30, but decided to do the $ 15.99 AYCE instead since the cost is around the same and we can actually order what we want to eat ( we can be picky) and it also included sashimi, although there were only 3 fish choices.</li><li>Overall, the sashimi is fresh and the cuts are pretty beautiful.</li><li>2: Fried Udon, the one I ordered first time there and really surprised by the texture of the udon and the well-balanced sauce 3: Teriyaki Chicken Lunch Box: Chicken are so tender and juicy, sauce not too salty or sweet, love it, and good portion again I 've been Aoyama for their signature sashimi, did turn me down, but this one never turns me down, so sad to see it 's under-rated review on yelp.</li><li>I 've tried a lot of other things, and all has been prepared with care and flavour- from sushi rolls, to sashimi, to gyoza and the baked oysters ( love ' em !!).</li><li>I do n't think I would return, but with a second TeamBuy voucher, and their unwillingness to refund it, I think I will have to! 10 piece sashimi lunch special with bowl of rice and also comes with miso soup and salad $ 10.95- the sashimi was fairly fresh but portions small Eel with rice $ 11.95- I have had AYCE eel with rice that tasted better than this.</li><li>There was VERY little sashimi.</li><li>The rice was a good portion, but the only sashimi that seemed fresh and not defrosted was the salmon.</li><li>The sashimi was served on a bed of rice.</li><li>It came with ahi tuna, white tuna, salmon and some other variety of sashimi.</li><li>Solely based on appearance, the sashimi did n't look that bad either.</li><li>The sashimi is not that fresh and there was not much taste to the volcano roll.</li><li>I started with a trio of sake and the assorted sashimi.</li><li>I followed up the sashimi with a black dragon roll and avocado salad.</li><li>Their hot meals are usually good however their sushi and sashimi is lackluster.</li><li>Had the sashimi and nigiri sushi combo for lunch.</li><li>The sashimi .. was flavourless.</li><li>Food: The sashimi and sushi here are usually fresh, albeit on the pricy side.</li><li>Good- convenient location, great sashimi, their dinner for 2 menu and sashimi/sushi boat are great.</li><li>Pro:- fresh sushi and sashimi.</li><li>I ordered the Korean version of sashimi ( ca n't recall the name).</li><li>The sushi and sashimi is better.</li><li>The sashimi is alright, but for the white tuna, i do n't know why they make it as tataki, it 's burn little bit and taste weird at the burn part.</li><li>The sashimi was very tasteful and the tempura was decent.</li><li>In particular, chirashi don is my favorite, their sashimi is always fresh and tasty.</li><li>You wo n't find any special cuts of sashimi here like otoro.</li><li>Portion sizes for sashimi are on the smaller side but you get what you pay for.</li><li>Anyhow, the sashimi was just ok and the ramen was n't very flavourful.</li><li>If you are here for sashimi and cooked food it will come faster.</li><li>Not only that, my father has noticed that the quality and quantity of his sashimi drastically changed over time.</li><li>Their sashimi is always good but they keep altering and screwing with sizes of their maki rolls, so I ca n't trust this place to be filling or reliably good, even if I order the same thing every time.</li><li>Disappointing, but at least their sashimi is good.</li><li>ALL of these things were listed on the menu ... they also seem very stinge with everything. servings are small ... which could be a good thing ... i ordered beef sashimi .. that must be the most horrifying color i have ever seen ... it looked like rotting corpse from the walking dead color. just looked wrong .. please see pics. ordered the beef ribs ... it came out jet black burnt ... see pic. why would you bother serving it ? it makes no sense. the dude left a paper on our table and did not take the order, so i brought it to the front since i was going to the washroom ... he then gives me a lecture saying dont give orders to the front desk. i wouldnt have to if your service was better. water was never filled once. the only reason this place gets 2 star is because they had red tuna as a sashimi choice. which btw came out two different colors .. one time it was red .. the second time i ordered it was light pink ... i suspect they gave me F grade fish the second time around.</li><li>Food is n't much different than any other AYCE, sashimi was good but nothing exciting.</li><li>For $ 25 at dinner, we can have sushi, sashimi, teriyaki etc in the `` all you can eat'' option ..</li><li>I ordered all the most horrifying things to a sashimi virgin, and mixed the wasabi and soy sauce for him.</li><li>One did not have sashimi and the other did ( for $ 14.99 wknd lunch).</li><li>The quality of the food was ok, the sashimi was fresh but really small pieces.</li><li>My Sushi is my go-to AYCE sushi restaurant FOOD QUALITY: The sashimi is fresh for an AYCE a place and comes in good cuts.</li><li>The sashimi is always fresh which is very important.</li><li>The sashimi was cut weird.</li><li>The sashimi is n't very fresh and the service is just passable for my standards.</li><li>Their sashimi varied in quality.</li><li>But the second order of sashimi was just ... nasty.</li><li>They have a great selection of desserts. sashimi seems pretty fresh altho we usually only eat salmon.</li><li>The sashimi was not served with radish shavings, but the actual fish was good.</li><li>I also tried some nigiri and sashimi.</li><li>It is not modern japanese cuisine ( no dragon rolls), it is really just straightup sushi and sashimi prepared by old school guys who have been tending on me since infancy.</li><li>Quality and freshness of sashimi is high.</li><li>The miso is the tastiest I have ever had, and the rolls and sashimi is of very high quality.</li><li>I did n't try my friend 's food, but she got chicken teriyaki, rice, and sashimi in her box ( + miso soup, salad, and orange).</li><li>Sashimi was fresh and sliced well- but not the highest end cuts/picks.</li><li>Fresh sashimi, delicious maki rolls and one of the best dolsot bimbimbap.</li><li>Friday night dinner for 2: We did enjoy it but had some criticism of the sushi and sashimi.</li><li>We ordered some rolls ( avocado, unagi- Caterpillar, and mixed fish- Atlantic), the extra small sashimi party platter that comes with miso soups and green salads ( which we upgraded for $ 2.70 fee each to wakame salad), and a BBQ beef short ribs appetizer ( kalbi).</li><li>The biggest minus was that not all of the sashimi was as fresh as it could have been; unexpected for a Friday night.</li><li>The sashimi was cut fairly well, and the salmon and white tuna were fresh.</li><li>My boyfriend and I went here and I felt that we got this great deal on a shared meal that included:- a medium sized lobster cooked or as sashimi- tempura- rice x2- lamb rack- salmon filet- mussel soup x 2- salad x2 This entire meal would 've been around $ 60 altogether, which I think is a great deal!</li><li>We ordered a Salmon Love Boat ( 30 sashimi pieces for $ 12) and bento boxes each.</li><li>Contrary to the other reviews, the quality of the sashimi here tako 'd me by surprise.</li><li>Their dine-in menu includes appetizers, sushi &amp; sashimi, special rolls, live lobster, BBQ beef short ribs, curry, cutlets, grilled salmon, set course meals, teppanyaki dishes and so much more.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
