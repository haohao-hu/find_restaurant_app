dinner are quite quiet but there are lots of businesses around this area so I guess there is a loyal crowd who comes in.</li><li>My parents had taken some friends out there for dinner and was appalled by the service and the layout of the tables.</li><li>I came here for dinner with my vegetarian friend.</li><li>Really, I felt like I was a little kid, eating dinner at a friend 's house ( particularly since I grew up in the area).</li><li>A little too early for dinner but a deal is a deal and I am into specials ...</li><li>So I made a reservation using Opentable for a 6:30 pm early dinner at Left Bank.</li><li>I would strongly recommend this to someone with small kids that wants to be able to go out for dinner somewhere the kids will love that is not McDonald 's!</li><li>I was one of the first ones to receive their dinner but it was cold.</li><li>I have half a pizza left for dinner tonight:) It was heavenly &amp; crispy!</li><li>Just keep in mind that they close at 8pm so plan to go there for an early dinner.</li><li>Walking into High Street Fish and Chips on this Saturday for an early dinner made me wondering if I am in Toronto anymore ...</li><li>And it was only 6 PM, I guess people have dinner early here!: P Closed Sundays and Mondays!</li><li>The retail items for lunch or dinner tend to be terribly over-salted most of the time.</li><li>First time have dinner there with my husband, we ordered a dinner for two which comes with wings &amp; rolls to start, then a combination plate with BBQ chicken &amp; pork, and we asked for upgrad a steam rich into garlic rich ..... the BBQ meats are very good condition, a man who looks very nice and I believed he is the owner of the restaurant told me they fresh cook the food by order, no msg ~ ~ that 's a good selling point.</li><li>Will definitely be returning! 3.5 Star Sampaguita Village does have a feel of a down to earth hole in the wall restaurant in a little village where everyone drop by for dinner.</li><li>Anyways the food here is good and if you have a lot of time to spare for dinner, then it is fine.</li><li>I came here for dinner on a weekday with a party of 3.</li><li>I came here for dinner on a Saturday night.</li><li>Cost ( 3/5): ~ $ 27 for dinner ..</li><li>Although the lunch buffet price is half of dinner and there seemed to be over 75 + items listed, nothing but the dinner only items stood out ( no sashimi for lunch), I personally would n't make my money worth by coming here for lunch.</li><li>Although the lunch buffet price is half of dinner and there seemed to be over 75 + items listed, nothing but the dinner only items stood out ( no sashimi for lunch), I personally would n't make my money worth by coming here for lunch.</li><li>If I 'm coming back again, it would be for dinner because there is no sashimi for lunch.</li><li>I was there for dinner at weekend.</li><li>I wanted to like this place and to be quite honest I do n't think I can rate it fairly when I was n't able to try dinner as I currently have a bun in my oven ... seemed pointless to go for dinner when I ca n't eat the best part ... sashimi.</li><li>With weekend pricing, dinner was $ 27 + tax + tip, which is pricier than my last two places, but is n't the price of everything going up ? ( especially in Canada these days ...)</li><li>Service is quick and friendly. went for lunch before and went again for dinner, the sashimi were fresh and thick cut the way they are suppose to be and the beef and the scallop sashimi was delishhhhhh !!!</li><li>They also charged us for AYCE dinner when we did n't order anything from the AYCE dinner menu.</li><li>The price for adults on weekend for lunch: $ 15.95; for dinner: $ 25.95.</li><li>Cozy, very fast and nice service, 22.95 for AYCE dinner on a weekday ( Mon to Thur) POP INCLUDED IN AYCE PRICE! love this part.</li><li>All together: it 's a hefty 33 bucks after tax on the weekends for dinner.</li><li>Came for dinner with my mother recently.</li><li>They were probably heading up for the dinner rush, since we entered around 5:30, which is pretty early for dinner.</li><li>Went there for dinner on Thursday night, dishes on the dinner menu is very nice too.</li><li>For Dinner, Sinchon Food serves more family style like in a big hot pot starting from $ 27 ..</li><li>I guess no one should be eating dinner by themselves and it is all about sharing food with families and friends over some soju!</li><li>Came here to have dinner, the place was packed, so we could enter only after a 20-minute wait outside ( !!)</li><li>This place becomes an absolute zoo on the weekends for dinner.</li><li>Our night was ruined, and i felt soooooo embarrassed for it was my idea to have dinner here.</li><li>Affordable enough that I might come here every Sunday for dinner.</li><li>First time here, order the dinner sets.</li><li>Unfortunately, I came in for dinner early in the week so they did n't have Prime Rib or Oysters.</li><li>I just went to Ehwa today for dinner.</li><li>Definitely recommend for lunch or dinner ......</li><li>For two patties, a small dinner, and dumpling ( extra gravy), came to less than $ 15.</li><li>As soon as I entered, the host asked if I want the lunch buffet special or dinner.</li><li>It 's a favourite place of my Grandfather-in-law ( is that a thing ??) so we end up here most nights we have dinner with them.</li><li>I 've come here a few times for dinner, lunch and take out.</li><li>For tonight 's dinner with a special friend, we ordered half a roasted duck ( $ 8.50), fried pork chop with spicy salt ( $ 6.95), and deep fried seafood with spicy salt ( $ 13.75).</li><li>During dinner hours, its more quiet and sometimes we would be the only table there eating.</li><li>This Ichiban is a great place for lunch or dinner.</li><li>All in all, we left this place around 10:30 and there will still a lot of guests eating dinner and drinking, which means my find for a late-night spot in my area is now over.</li><li>Came here for dinner with my Dad.</li><li>It ai n't the west coast but it 'll do for dinner or lunch; I go here regularly, maybe too regularly. i remember in University we used to come here all the time, because the choices were either this ( and it was n't even that cheap) or sapporo sushi up the street.</li><li>The place is small so seating is a bit limited during the rush times like lunch and dinner.</li><li>I came here with 2 friends for dinner.</li><li>A few people sat for dinner.</li><li>For lunch they have a buffet but for dinner it is a la carte.</li><li>This restaurant is close to the Toronto Centre for Arts, so its great for dinner and a show.</li><li>Good for a date or romantic dinner.</li><li>My husband and I ordered the same dinner: prosciutto. with melon as an appetizer.</li><li>The staff were amazing and so helpful. we went yesterday for dinner and ordered INSALATA CAPRESE and CALAMARI FRITTI and were so good. and for the main course we ordered ORECCHIETTE AROMANTICA and a special dish ( chicken breast stuffed with cheese and spinach and vegetables on the side) and that when it went totally wrong.</li><li>The service was good though, and the place was getting packed later on the dinner shift so it is a popular place.</li><li>We just had a fantastic dinner at Mezza Notte.</li><li>This was an excellent place for dinner when visiting Shops at Don Mills.</li><li>Lovely place for dinner.</li><li>Came here recently for dinner.</li><li>We had dinner at your establishment last night and thoroughly enjoyed our experience.</li><li>The first time was fabulous but the last two times I did n't really enjoy the dinner.</li><li>I was there for the 25 dollar dinner, which provided a choice of appertizer, soup or salad, an entree, and a dessert.</li><li>I 've been here for lunch, for dinner, with small parties and with large groups- the food and the service is very consistent.</li><li>Best dish is the panang curry- Beef panang ( lunch and dinner portions are prepared differently- dinner is crispy), or my favourite, the Thai Islamic Noodles with shrimp and chicken.</li><li>I am absolutely ashamed that this restaurant exists- why decline customers that are clearly looking to spend money on a dinner and then accept otherwise.</li><li>They were separated by the red dividers at the centre and were talking across the `` holes'' during their entire dinner.</li><li>You really expect a $ 15 tip on a $ 30 dinner.</li><li>I had heard about this place years ago, finally tried the prix fixe menu for $ 25 for dinner the past weekend.</li><li>We came here for dinner and was greeted by a very friendly waiter:) From first glance, the decor had a really traditional Thai feel but still lived up to the modern in its name.</li><li>Had dinner here on the weekend and it was OK.</li><li>Thai iced tea was n't the greatest either. after eating dinner at Linda, s modern thai last night, I would not refer anyone who like, s good thai food to go there.the food is plan, and the portions are very small, well the price, s are high. dinner with two dish, s and a small salad was around seventy five dollar, s.we had to pick up food on the way home as we were still not full.there are so many better thai place, s in Toronto.</li><li>Thai iced tea was n't the greatest either. after eating dinner at Linda, s modern thai last night, I would not refer anyone who like, s good thai food to go there.the food is

dinner.</li><li>The 8 dollar dinner is a bit pricy but it 's worth it.</li><li>I came here for dinner with a group of friends who had never eaten Xinjiang/Chinese Muslim food before.</li><li>I believe it ranges between 14.99 and 18.99 depending on whether it is lunch or dinner and which day of the week it is but do n't quote me on that.</li><li>For dinner I ordered the 2lb king crab dinner market price witch was $ 86 and a lobster tail $ while we were at the table a waitress was showing a almost four lb lobster to a child I must admit looked delicious.</li><li>Dinner was under $ 30 plus tip.</li><li>I would suggest coming in early for dinner if you wanted to come here without placing reservations.</li><li>I love coming here for a quick, cheap, and filling dinner.</li><li>He loves

came here for late night dinner, had the king 's tea pork ribs with rice combo.</li><li>This is one of my go-to 's for a reasonably priced dinner and drink.</li><li>Two portions for two people for lunch was more than sufficient, and even two portions for three people for dinner plus a side of dumplings was fine too.</li><li>I came here for dinner with a group of friends as an alternative to Korean BBQ.</li><li>Came back again tonight for dinner.</li><li>If you have a house party or small dinner party with friends and family, definitely get their party set.</li><li>Came here on a Sunday evening for dinner.</li><li>Their cooked dinner was not as flavourful as it could have been and the meat was on the dry side.</li><li>Wow!, dinner was pitifully lousy !!</li><li>Came for dinner, lots of empty seats but service was still slow.</li><li>Italian sausage penne- A great choice for dinner They 've done a great job with the restaurant itself too.</li><li>Peking Man is a favourite spot for my husband and I, when we go out with his mom for dinner.</li><li>Came here for dinner on Christmas Eve by chance as many restaurants in this neighbourhood had been affected by the ice storm, nothing was open and we were starving.</li><li>A family of five orders the following for dinner: Bamboo and Dried Scallop Soup, Deep-fried Soft Shell Crab, Peking Duck Special, Lobster fried in salt and pepper, and Shanghai Noodles with beef.</li><li>When I went last for dinner at a normal dinner time around 8pm it was nearly empty there.</li><li>I would like to return, for dinner as they still feature the old cantonese cuisine.</li><li>Throughout our dinner, I felt as though we were ignored for the rest of dinner compared to the other tables because of the communication barrier.</li><li>Overall the dinner is good.</li><li>The prices are a bit high for lunch but for dinner, this would be a good option.</li><li>Visited Fri Nov 25 for dinner ( Party of 2) I called to make reservations, and they say they do n't take reservations.</li><li>Went here for dinner with some friends.</li><li>We did n't get any desserts so I think that 's only for dinner ??</li><li>Had I

this time, for an earlier dinner.</li><li>Came here for dinner tonight- I did n't pick the venue and would never recommend this place.</li><li>I guess I 'll be having this Oasis Mango Smoothie for lunch and dinner which, I guess, is really not such a bad thing cuz it is diviiiiine.</li><li>For a dinner with 4 people it usually comes up to $ 35 at most with tips and taxes.</li><li>The table smells and it was not a good place for us to have a nice dinner.</li><li>Went here with a friend and her son for dinner.</li><li>The food Marche serves for appetizers and main courses for brunch,

usually get the dinner for two for my husband and I which is more than enough food for 2 ppl.</li><li>Went there for dinner.</li><li>I came here for dinner with my boyfriend on a Groupon

Saturday since we were waiting to catch the 10:00PM showing of the Dark Knight Rises, and Ichiban was right downstairs.</li><li>Came here for early dinner, just before the somewhat busy dinner rush.</li><li>Well it was good, its not all you can eat and kinda on the pricier side but nice for dinner for 2 The restaurant was clean and the service was great.</li><li>Would also be a cute place

total of $ 10 including tip which is super cheap for dinner!</li><li>I came here with my Korean friend for dinner on a Sunday night and I was told that this is her family 's go-to restaurant.</li><li>I also think it says a lot this place was bursting at the seams--with a line coming out the door and everything--during both the dinner and lunch services I ate at.</li><li>Would you take your family out for dinner where you place order foods for 4 people, wait 45min. and it never did show up on your table ?</li><li>The dinner was awful.</li><li>And fyi, the yelp deal is only valid for dinner.</li><li>There was only three of us, and we had dinner AYCE.</li><li>I 'll try lunch or dinner here next time.</li><li>Went out for dinner with my boyfriend and I tried a new menu item, it was a kimchi fried rice dish with vegetables.</li><li>The 9 of us came by for a late dinner ( 12am) and lucky us, got a table immediately.</li><li>Overall if you 're looking for lunch or dinner I think there are better options for Korean food in the area.</li><li>Other than that, go eat some quality gamjatang here for lunch, dinner, or hell, even 2 am snack!</li><li>Came for dinner ( had dinner for two).</li><li>Went here for dinner tonight.</li><li>Fortunately, we did n't have to wait too long to be seated and was able to eye what other tables were having for dinner.</li><li>We, party of 6, came here for dinner.</li><li>Stopped by for dinner and was not disappointed.</li><li>I do believe they use the same menu for lunch and dinner, which would explain the dinner-like price point.</li><li>It 's just very mediocre, and I would not come here just for dinner.</li><li>We went here for dinner on Sunday night.</li><li>Just finished having dinner here- I ordered the veal with cheese and hot peppers.</li><li>I 've been here multiple times, sometimes for a lunch or relaxed dinner.</li><li>I got a rice-based dinner; all the ingredients tasted fresh, though I felt the sauce was applied too heavily.</li><li>My mom was craving for cold noodles so we decided to go there for dinner.</li><li>Particularly for lunch or dinner, dine-in ( they also do take-out).</li><li>Last Friday night my girlfriend and I came for dinner.</li><li>She urged us to stay and have dinner.</li><li>Not a bad place for dinner if you 're craving Korean food.</li><li>Your dinner does n't come with a free korean pancake like Oh Geul Boh Gol 's though, oh well,- 1 star!</li><li>Lunch special portions at $ 10 mean you can have lunch AND leftovers for dinner!</li><li>I recently had dinner at Zaffron and overall it was a pleasant experience and I walked away having enjoyed my meal.</li><li>All in all, I 'm not sure you could ask for more when going out for a nice dinner.</li><li>I can only think of one word to describe our dinner at Zaffron- `` Meh''.</li><li>AND it 's cheap too- $ 18.95 for dinner ( Mon- Thur).</li><li>Really 11% was not good on a $ 200 dinner ?</li><li>Many (!) menus in both English and Chinese ( e.g. lunch specials, dim sum, dinner, etc.).</li><li>Buffet at lunch ... a la carte for dinner and they deliver .. no complaints!</li><li>This is my third time having dinner here.</li><li>We were here for dinner &amp; got to try their Family Special Menu ( Sundays only).</li><li>In the past, when you ate at the Teppanyaki table, you would get an inclusive dinner .... salad, main course, dessert.</li><li>$ 40- $ 65, salads $ 15- $ 20, sushi $ 20 + the dinner adds up quickly.</li><li>Salad, Soup Teppanyaki main plate that consists of Chicken, Beef, Scallops, Zucchini, Onions and mushrooms with a single scoop of ice cream to finish the dinner.</li><li>This restaurant was not very busy for a Friday night dinner, I suspect it is because of the many other food options close by at lower prices.</li><li>When on a business trip to Toronto for work a co-worker took a couple people to Kasura for dinner.</li><li>Dinner with a large group may be a better experience and while I did that several times 10 years ago, I would n't think of going there for a large group dinner today.</li><li>Bottom line, if you wanna find a good dinner at a reasonable price, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND coming here!</li><li>Will prob. be back when we want an artery clogging dinner.</li><li>Went here for dinner.</li><li>They have daily specials that you can take advantage of whether you 're here for dinner, dessert or just a drink ( the cocktail list is quite extensive).</li><li>My husband and I had ordered chicken and meat loaf on Thursday I think from the dinner for two menu and it was absolutely delicious ... however the regular menu we ordered from at our last visit was very dissapointing!</li><li>Great new spot in my hood with such warm ambiance great for families or friends for dinner, coffee, dessert or all of the above.</li><li>Went here for dinner on a Saturday- got a great seat on the patio and had an amazing meal!</li><li>I do n't recommend Going at dinner or lunch because the food slides down.doiring dinner and sometimes lunch everyday they have specials that have not very good food for a decent price.</li><li>For dinner I had the pesto salmon.</li><li>A friend had a Groupon that he had to use so we went here for dinner tonight.</li><li>We go there almost every Sunday; sometimes for Dim Sum, sometimes for dinner.</li><li>It was a very filling dinner, so we could have removed 2 rolls from the meal.</li><li>This is kinda self serve but it 's good because there 's a lot of variety for dinner:) also alcohol everywhere on each table &amp; a open bar: D.</li><li>It seems odd to go to a banquet hall for dinner when it 's not a wedding, and at one point, I thought we were crashing one after walking past a bride and groom posing for pictures.</li><li>Despite this personal choice of style by some, I actually like the idea of dressing up in your best outfit for a dinner and show.</li><li>In fact it is good enough for two meals- I always go there for late lunch and pack the rice with the eel for dinner.</li><li>Their lunch and dinner looked fine from the tables around.</li><li>Our dinner was an intimate gathering but right from the start we were treated like royalty.</li><li>It was a rocky relationship for sure and it was for Valentines day dinner a few years back and I have to say it was truly an amazing experience ... and the food was ok too lol.</li><li>After dinner, two of our party asked to share a small 20-year-old port for twenty dollars a glass.</li><li>Perfect for late night dinner!</li><li>$ 22 Dinner on weekends !!!</li><li>But my family tends to eat lunch a bit late, so we generally end up at the Mongolian Grill around or just before 2:00pm, and the place closes at 3:30 to get ready for dinner.</li><li>I went there for dinner yesterday with my hubby.</li><li>Great variety and price-quality is pretty good ( for lunch, dinner is more expensive).</li><li>I 'd come back and I 'd recommend this to anyone who is interested in doing something a little different and a little more casual for dinner with a group of people.</li><li>Edit: price wise, this place is only worth it

Experience: Dinner Specialty: Israeli Menu items: Hummus Appetizer, Chicken Kebab and Lamb Chops On the epicenter of Middle-Eastern cuisine in North York, in the north-east corner of Bathurst and Finch, you will find a tiny but mighty `` shawarma'' style looking spot called Belle Bar &amp; Restaurant.</li><li>Inside has more of a homestyle dinner look.</li><li>Ordered over-medium once and received over easy, which was unappetising and went uneaten. ... love this mom and pops place! the staff is quite friendly and the owner always greets us personally whenever he 's around. i have personally only ever ordered from their all day breakfast menu so i ca n't speak for their lunch and dinner but it is the best breakfast at the most decent price. while i have ordered many breakfast dishes, my favorite go-to is the eggs benedict with smoked salmon and asparagus. i must have had this dish once a week for the past year and it 's been cooked to perfection every time. the sauce is not too heavy, not too light. the eggs are always made the way you like it- i make sure i get them to soft poach them. home fries are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. weekend mornings and brunch time get pretty busy but it is always worth the wait:).</li><li>Dinner was alright.</li><li>A local joint which I visit regularly, Kenzo serves up decent bowls of ramen- perfect for a quick lunch or dinner on a cold winter day.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
