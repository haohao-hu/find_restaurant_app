<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 215' %><h2>Hollandaise sauce<br />occurrence: 23</h2><div><ol><li>Hollandaise sauce was goop.</li><li>Also the Hollandaise sauce was n't totally on point or smooth, intact a tad clumpy.</li><li>The Hollandaise sauce was too salty and they put too much lemon juice in it.</li><li>The hollandaise sauce is all broken up over the food and turns you right off.</li><li>I love egg benedicts so I ordered a vegetarian option that was not on the menu ( the menu in general is not super veg friendly) for some reason they give you an option of having the eggs hard, medium or soft which I never experienced before in any of the brunch places. bennies just always come soft- otherwise they 're not bennies but hard boiled eggs on top of an english muffin, the portion included only side of fries and two bennies with spinach. no slices of orange, no toast included. total of $ 9 the spinach somehow had very grassy taste. hollandaise sauce was too salty and flavorless ... the whole food tasting experience was just blah. on the other end the service was very nice and even though they confused my friend 's order the replacement came in in matter of seconds and she was charged less. but I 'm not going back for eggs ... maybe will check pancakes or waffles.</li><li>I LOVED the biscuit it was flaky and buttery and the hollandaise sauce had great flavour and was very buttery which I loved.</li><li>The hollandaise sauce did n't really taste like much of anything, and I 'm pretty sure it came out of a can rather than being house-made.</li><li>If you like eggs benedict, I can tell you that their hollandaise sauce is more delicious and generous than tons of other more expensive places in the city.</li><li>Eggs Benedict has a decent hollandaise sauce.</li><li>Excellent hollandaise sauce!</li><li>The hollandaise sauce was alright ... not the best but not the worst.</li><li>Fresh homemade chunky homefries, paired with two toasted English muffins, 2 perfectly poached eggs, 2 slices of back bacon ( tastes and looks more like ham), and hollandaise sauce smothered on top.</li><li>Best hollandaise sauce I 've tried outside of Lambton Golf Club 's Chef Kieback.</li><li>However, their hollandaise sauce was lack of flavour and quite powderly.</li><li>They did not hold back on the hollandaise sauce, which made everything taste extremely salty.</li><li>I did find though that the cheese gave the English muffins more of a gooey texture instead of crisp and toasted and the hollandaise sauce had started to separate.</li><li>The Hollandaise sauce was good and it is a really good combination with the salmon underneath the egg, since the salmon is a salty on its own.</li><li>Their hollandaise sauce and the pouched eggs are nicely done.</li><li>They 're always eager to clean off your table once they notice you 've stopped eating .. first, we got a table that was highly uncomfortable, the seats felt shitty that we were/felt sunken in .... space is cramped .... just not comfy at all ... and food sucked .. i ordered a eggs florentine ... equivalent to a vegetarian eggs benedict, basically the same hollandaise sauce .... but it was o so shitty ... my friend ordered a club sandwich ... the bread looked like whole wheat wonderbread .. c-r-a-p. ( review for the bathurst &amp; sheppard location) Came in here a couple of weeks ago to order take-out as I was craving a burger.</li><li>The hollandaise sauce was made perfectly and the servings were large ...</li><li>The hollandaise sauce was creamy and not salty.</li><li>Their hollandaise sauce is absolutely perfect in my opinion.</li><li>Amazing hollandaise sauce.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
