<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 263' %><h2>egg<br />occurrence: 21</h2><div><ol><li>I have n't tried many other things on the menu because I tend to stick to what I like ( selective eater over here) but I have tried their egg drop soup in the past which was very good as well as the roast beef sandwich.</li><li>The only thing missing from their menu is the egg or milk pudding ( dun daan) I 'm not sure why they do n't make it.</li><li>I 'm used to the egg in my katsu don being much less well done than this.</li><li>$ 18.95 for Chirashi that has so little sashimi variety- where 's my egg and fish roe ?!</li><li>The egg was scaldingly hot but something in the sandwich was ice box freezing.</li><li>The egg was cooked nicely so that when cut, yolk ran out.</li><li>My go to dishes are:- Banh beo bi- Banh cuon ( with/without sausage)- Com thap cam ( grilled pork, grilled chicken, shredded pork, steamed egg, fried egg)- and of course PHO!</li><li>Moist enough to carry the scrambled eggs ( which were done to moistness but the blob of egg was falling out of the wrap) but maybe that was the complicated not well designed cardboard packaging for the McD wraps ' fault.</li><li>Now onto the food: Pad thai: rice noodles, carrots, peanuts, tofu, green onions, bean sprouts, coriander, egg, fish, and tamarind sauce with chicken.</li><li>It finally came, it looks not bad with home fries .. however when I cut the first one, the egg was fully cooked !!</li><li>Sausage &amp; minced pork rice with egg: rice was way over cooked, mince pork tasted nothing but soy sauce, egg was burnt on one side, vegetable look and tasted like left over from 2 days ago coming straight out of fridge.</li><li>My final tip: crack the raw egg in the bowl immediately the tofu bowl is served, then carefully spoon the molten hot soup over the egg to cook the egg whites but leave the yolk runny.</li><li>The egg that you crack on the soup would instantly cook itself and the gooey yolk would blend into the spicy goodness.</li><li>If you are not a big fan of hot soup, that 's okay because their bi bim bap ( rice w/ veggies, egg, beef, mix w/ Korean hot sauce served in hot stone bowl) and bul go gi ( marinated beef on sizzling plate) is amazing too.</li><li>The egg was pre-dropped into the soup so by the time I got to it, it was already hard boiled.</li><li>The egg was good, but quite filling.</li><li>- Hot Stone Bibimbap: Was nice and hot and the egg was done right: runny.</li><li>The egg sunny-side up was at least cooked but was just under to my taste ( the white-egg part near the yolk was still present and ' slimy').</li><li>Sashimi options were standard- salmon, white tuna, surf clam, kani, egg ... etc.</li><li>The novelty with the Mongolian Grill is that you are presented with a wide variety of raw meats ( beef, pork, chicken, and lamb) and vegetables, some seafoods ( shrimps, fake crab and squid rings), noodles ( egg, rice, udon, etc.) and a stupefying selection of soupy sauces ( spicy, curry, honey garlic ... more than 10 in total) and condiment sauces ( ginger, garlic, oyster ... more than 20 in total).</li><li>Also, the egg was cooked perfectly.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
