<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 837' %><h2>fried food<br />occurrence: 4</h2><div><ol><li>I will say that it 's quite a lot of fried food to consume at one sitting.</li><li>That being said, I do n't have filipino food often because I always end up ordering a lot of fatty fried food, and little to no veggies.</li><li>I find that that sometimes the temperature of my food is inconsistent- most of the time it 's perfect, but on some visits it 's just kind of warm instead of hot, which for fried food is disappointing.</li><li>If you cannot eat fried food, do n't come here because 99% of the items on the menu are fried related ( since it 's called the Fry lol).</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
