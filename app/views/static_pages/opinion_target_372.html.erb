<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 372' %><h2>beef tataki<br />occurrence: 13</h2><div><ol><li>I was only there to catch some drinks with friends so just had an Asahi and beef tataki which did not disappoint.</li><li>Highly recommend the beef tataki and herb white tuna sashimi.</li><li>My favourites were the rock shrimp, beef tataki, yuzu salmon and chicken wing skewers.</li><li>The food is good and there are a lot of good points and must tries to this AYCE:- scallop sashimi ( it was quite delicious and fresh)- beef tataki ( although I was n't a fan of it)- gui ling gao ( in the dessert menu- not something I 've seen at other AYCE places)- takoyaki tastes really good ( the flavour is on point!)- grilled squid ( reminded me of night markets, it was very tasty, was n't too chewy at all)- grilled eggplant ( there 's a sweet sauce and it is grilled nicely)- chicken wing skewers ( they 're so good!, the wings are skewed on so the bones are pushed down)- pop is included in the menu ( so no extra charge for all you pop lovers!).</li><li>Most notably, they have tataki on the menu and the Beef Tataki was actually quite good!</li><li>The items I would highly recommend as a MUST try are: Scallop Sashimi, Squid ( Ika) Sushi and Beef Tataki.</li><li>I was really excited to see some very interesting items that I do n't normally find at Japanese AYCE places which included salmon tataki ( raw salmon thinly sliced seared with a vinegary sauce), beef tataki, and scallop sashimi.</li><li>They have a lot of specialty items -- beef tataki, yuzu salmon, rock shrimp -- that they do n't serve at a lot of other AYCE locations.</li><li>In particular, I like the beef tataki, the salmon tataki and the scallop sashimi ( available on weekends and holidays).</li><li>I love the beef tataki and the numerous shrimp dishes.</li><li>One of the main reasons why we come here over other sushi places is because if the beef tataki and sake mussels.</li><li>A ton of variety and a few standout dishes including: the Sushi Legend Fried Rice, the Spicy Scallop Sushi, Beef Tataki, and their Specialty Salmon Sashimi Dish.</li><li>Other AYCE sushi restaurants will give you proper sushi and Miso Soup, for an even lower price ( 11.99 on most places for weekday lunch hours). bf and i came here last Sunday afternoon and had the gold menu for AYCE. it was less than average especially for the price, $ 21.99 on weekends and holidays and does not include drinks except for water and tea. this is the only AYCE place that comes out with our order of sashimi last. the most disappointing part was the food. salmon sushi were huge and sliced in cubes, steak cubes came in bits and pieces but was decent, buttered mushrooms were burnt, masago was too salty due to low quality, beef tataki was not fresh, i think the kalbi ribs were old cause they were so chewy i couldnt chew through them, spider roll was the worst! i couldnt even drink the tea cause the cups had such a strong bleach scent. needless to say, we will not be returning and would not recommend it to anyone.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
