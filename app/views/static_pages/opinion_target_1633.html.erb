<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1633' %><h2>red tuna<br />occurrence: 2</h2><div><ol><li>The chirasu sashimi, except for the red tuna ( odd), were quite thin, as well, the salmon on the dragon rolls were even thinner.</li><li>ALL of these things were listed on the menu ... they also seem very stinge with everything. servings are small ... which could be a good thing ... i ordered beef sashimi .. that must be the most horrifying color i have ever seen ... it looked like rotting corpse from the walking dead color. just looked wrong .. please see pics. ordered the beef ribs ... it came out jet black burnt ... see pic. why would you bother serving it ? it makes no sense. the dude left a paper on our table and did not take the order, so i brought it to the front since i was going to the washroom ... he then gives me a lecture saying dont give orders to the front desk. i wouldnt have to if your service was better. water was never filled once. the only reason this place gets 2 star is because they had red tuna as a sashimi choice. which btw came out two different colors .. one time it was red .. the second time i ordered it was light pink ... i suspect they gave me F grade fish the second time around.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
