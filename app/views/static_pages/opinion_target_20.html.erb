<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 20' %><h2>meat<br />occurrence: 367</h2><div><ol><li>The noodles were stale, like they sat there for days, the meat was tough.</li><li>The person that served me used her bare hands to put some peppers on the meat, I told her no peppers please !!!</li><li>Wing/rib platter- Big wings with good amount of meat.</li><li>Mt girlfriends family has made a tradition of going here every year for dinner on New Years Day ( why we keep going when one of the kids got their meal AFTER everyone else ate last year) Anyways, I tried a few things on the menu until I came across the souvlaki ( the meat, veg and rice was nothing special, but wow did I ever fall in love with the dressing on the Greek salad).</li><li>The ribs were dry, I think they were sitting out a while, but the meat was tender and like I said, the sauce was quite good.</li><li>Found uncooked meat on the counter, wondering how long has it been there.</li><li>I think it 's a little pricey for what you get, since there are n't a lot of expensive ingredients used, like say, meat.</li><li>The salad bar contains mostly starchy stuff like cold pastas or raw unflavoured veggies that have been sitting outside under their lights all day. the meals are mediocre ( the meat is always wayyy too chewy. too hard to chew or swallow. you know when steak is like that ? yeah.) and not anything special.</li><li>The meat was undercooked.</li><li>The meat was tender and deliciously spiced and came with a yummy coconut dipping sauce!</li><li>The meat comes shredded so they do n't do slices like Haida sandwich does.</li><li>The meat is sandwiched between a slightly toasted white sub roll and comes accompanied with lettuce, tomatoes, slices of dill pickle, and tahini sauce.</li><li>Severely overcooked meat was the primary problem.</li><li>The meat was cold and very overcooked.</li><li>The meat kinda tasted hard, rubbery.</li><li>I could n't even tell you if they were white or dark meat because I swallowed them whole before I could even decipher them.</li><li>The meat did n't have this char grilled flavor or anything, it was just coated in this addictive bbq sauce that made me want to run back and ask for a bottle.</li><li>My Gyros meat looked like shaved sausages when it was suppose to be pork.</li><li>Their meat is of high quality.</li><li>I am giving this place 3 stars since there are equally good Iranian restaurants in the area for lesser price and more flavourful meat!</li><li>The chicken itself was cooked nicely and the meat was tender.</li><li>It was pink and according to the description was beef however it was pink in colour and really just processed meat but something that I 've never seen before.</li><li>The meat just melts in your mouth and has so much flavour.</li><li>The meat was good, cooked properly and tasted fresh, which was good considering everything else there seemed to suck.</li><li>The only complaints I have are, I wished they seasoned their meat and better buns.</li><li>The meat is quite dry and does n't have much flavour, but I mainly come for the fries and gravy.</li><li>Although the portions do n't seem large, the amount of protein and carbs you get from the healthy serving of rice and meat, fills you up a lot faster than you originally think.</li><li>The business motto of the owner is great, they cook a large quantity of rice and meat in the morning.</li><li>Generally I usually have to get double meat as places never come correct.</li><li>I was really impressed with the food. the meat was hot, soft, and juicy.</li><li>The meat is really fresh and well seasoned, and the portion is HUGE （ something to keep in mind when you order) I have recommended this to friends and they agree that this is a meat lover 's paradise!</li><li>The meat is really fresh and well seasoned, and the portion is HUGE （ something to keep in mind when you order) I have recommended this to friends and they agree that this is a meat lover 's paradise!</li><li>They had salads, eggplant, veggies to the cooked meat from chicken in various styles from baked, breaded and stuffed to fish and pork.</li><li>The lamb pasta was so badly done, the dish was almost like a microwaved dinner; the meat was chewy, the pasta was disproportionately cold and hot, and the residual oil was overwhelming to my palette.</li><li>Steak was a bit on the bland side and the quality of the meat was average.</li><li>Ordered cactus cut potatoes, meat or pizza, pasta with their Rose sauce ( 50/50), and their Mediterranean chicken salad.</li><li>The ingredients are always fresh and everything always seems well-cooked ( eg, the meat is n't dry, etc.).</li><li>My dad on this occasion had the spaghetti bolognese which is just the perfect balance of tomato and meat.</li><li>The whole chicken, stuffed with glutinous rice, was a good size to share, and the meat was so tender!</li><li>The main course of rice and meat is prepared deliciously, and the complimentary Korean vegetable dishes complement the meal.</li><li>The meat was so thin it was like literally paper thin.</li><li>The other dish Bibimbap was presented so colorful mixed rice with meat and assorted vegetables.</li><li>The meat also felt very unfresh and the combination of veggies did n't even give the rice any flavour.</li><li>The meat glistened, like a ray from heaven.</li><li>After eating about a pound and a half of meat I felt like I was going to enter a meat induced coma.</li><li>After eating about a pound and a half of meat I felt like I was going to enter a meat induced coma.</li><li>The meat was good as I enjoy variety over portion ( though the portion was still hearty).</li><li>I gotta give this place 4 1/2 stars because they did n't have fries to go w/ the shawarma, but because the food was so good and all of their meat is Halal, I 'll round up to 5 stars.</li><li>The meat was on the shawarma grills and the rest of the items were kept in a cool salad bar.</li><li>I 've tried both the chicken and beef thinking that maybe I was picking the wrong kind of meat.</li><li>To top if off when I got back into my car with the food, I realized he did n't even toast the shawarma and the whole thing was cold including the meat ( luke warm).</li><li>The chicken is always juicy and fresh- The reason being is that they have lots of customers and when they are slow they turn down the roaster on the spike and when they get a rush of customers they turn it back on and make sure u get fresh juicy meat right off the spike!</li><li>Lucky its open late and on yonge st. Very blah, nothing special at all, the Canadian made shawarma ... not even close to true middle eastern style. meat is dry and tasteless, cant believe they have 2 locations!</li><li>The meat was flaky and tasted great.</li><li>The meat is fresh and never dry.</li><li>I ordered the smoked salmon eggs benedict that I was really looking forward too because I did n't want a meat heavy meal.</li><li>It was filling, very tasty, and had lots of meat that was cooked perfectly -- nice and juicy throughout, not over-done at all.</li><li>I know goat is considered a `` premium'' meat, but I still feel the price was a little steep.</li><li>Again, the meat was juicy and not over-cooked!</li><li>The rotis all come with potato in them, and it 's just the right amount to not overwhelm the meat.</li><li>Also skip the potatoes in favour of extra meat.</li><li>The meat and vegetables used are high quality so the final product is excellent.</li><li>You wo n't find meat you can eat in the noodle since they only give you the parts people do n't/cannot eat.</li><li>Just noodle with some vegetables, no soup but with some spring rolls and meat.</li><li>Their pho is ok, lots of noodles, meat is fresh but sliced very thinly.</li><li>While I can reluctantly give these guys points for the coconut flavored gravy, I must say that they completely bombed with the meat.</li><li>I kid you not; every piece of meat was a huge chunk of fat and the little meat that was there underneath fat was grossly undercooked.</li><li>I kid you not; every piece of meat was a huge chunk of fat and the little meat that was there underneath fat was grossly undercooked.</li><li>Like the spicy popcorn chicken covered with dried chilli peppers is mainly little bits and pieces of meat, no actual good pieces of meat.</li><li>Like the spicy popcorn chicken covered with dried chilli peppers is mainly little bits and pieces of meat, no actual good pieces of meat.</li><li>Or the sweet potato and pork is very bony, again few good pieces of meat.</li><li>They have really good meat on their burgers and servings for everything is always generous!</li><li>The soup base was excellent, the meat was tender and the accompanying vegetables add greatly to the flavour of the soup ( my friend told me the those greens are the secret to most Vietnamese dishes, so do n't ditch them).</li><li>They were very generous with the meat.</li><li>The broth here is amazing the meat is a nice texture I love when you take get take out how they separate in bag it all the only problem is the meat comes frozen so when you put it in your boss when you get home its like ice cold so you always have to warm up to meet separately and reheat your bra overall they 're pretty good unfortunately they only accept cash.</li><li>The

get home its like ice cold so you always have to warm up to meet separately and reheat your bra overall they 're pretty good unfortunately they only accept cash.</li><li>I really appreciate the nice amount of meat.</li><li>I got a large bowl of special beef noodles, and the broth was really tasty and the portions of meat were huge!</li><li>The server had told us in advance that the beef is served medium rare, which was fine, because we usually order meat rare to medium rare.</li><li>This meat was n't even rare.</li><li>My favourite spot for oysters and great meat, if I do n't want to go far.</li><li>What came out was an inedible, mangled piece of meat that was rare on the inside, yet still tough and grisly.</li><li>We alerted our server that the meat was tough and terrible, and he immediately took it off the bill.</li><li>Smooth like butter- my steak knife danced thru the tender meat like a figure skater setting up for a triple axle.</li><li>However, the meat itself and not just the coating is, overall, tastier than the aforementioned chains.</li><li>I often ask sasha the main shawarma maker to give me less chicken, its just too much meat for me to handle.</li><li>It is served on an oval platter and includes half rice, half meat, a few potato wedges, onions, pickled peppers, white sauce and hot sauce.</li><li>The meat was not that gamey and the small was more than enough ( I believe small is 1 skewer while the large might be 2) The salad was good as it was doused with tahini sauce.</li><li>The meat is so tasty and tender.</li><li>However, the taste of the meat is decent, but it is not Halal Guys in NYC.</li><li>I know ... why would I try Baton Rouge and not the meat ?</li><li>Dry with very little sauce and very little meat.</li><li>The pieces of beef in the nihari were all chunks of fat and no meat.</li><li>The nihari was covered, immersed in oil, more oil, less curry, clumps of starch powder, and chunks of fat in lieu of meat.</li><li>Their meat is tender and tasty as is their chicken.</li><li>The meat is so tender and really has u craving for more even on a full stomach !!!</li><li>I actually ordered a Bagali polo which was described as vegetable rice and meat but the waitress anoyingly came back to say it is sold out two minutes after recommending it!</li><li>It was good but not the best I have had because of a slightly funky meat taste.</li><li>Nice portion sizes for Kabob with rice combos, it could however use a little bit more than just a chunk of Onion + herbs as `` salad'' I 'll most definitely recommend this place for meat lovers, but not so much for people that wants a more balanced meal.</li><li>The salad, potatoes, and rice were average, but the meat was very unappetizing.</li><li>The meat is piled high ( as it should be!) between four slices of rye.</li><li>The meat was piled nice and high.</li><li>The meat was lean, soft and juicy.</li><li>And really, from one very serious meat lover to another, you need to try it.</li><li>Meat had lots of cartilage in it: not good quality meat.</li><li>Great sandwich but consistency of the meat has been questionable.</li><li>Being a good ole Southern Boy from the States, i would throw cole slaw and meat between any kind of bread.</li><li>That did n't make sense to me, and the meat was a little bit overcooked.</li><li>And that 's exactly what I got, the meat and the rice!</li><li>The grilled chicken is incredible because they char it up real nicely and the spices taste soaked into the meat and skin.</li><li>The meat is n't the most tender, but definitely tastes great to the bone.</li><li>- Nope!)- No Pita bread, but seemed like sausage buns that were tunred into a type of Garlic Bread ( WTF, right ?)- Lemon Potatoes seemed like they were cooked in Campbell 's Vegetable Soup and had an orange colored sauce on them ( Really, Campbell 's ?)- Meat was of a lower quality and smaller size chunks- beef was heavily spiced which is never a good sign when eating meat.</li><li>Generous meat filling, bathing in perfectly prepared gravy make for one very happy customer.</li><li>The meat was pretty sizeable so you will be full after.</li><li>I have attached a few photos of said mystery meat so you may see for yourself.</li><li>That being said, because of the mystery meat disappointment, I must only give 3 stars ( should I give an extra pity star ... ?).</li><li>If you tasted the chewy mystery meat for yourself you would understand.</li><li>The ingredients, sauce, seasoning and meat are terrible.</li><li>The lettuce was all over the place and sour cream was placed right on top of the lettuce instead of with the meat.</li><li>A probably sign of hiding stale, unfresh meat that has been sitting in the counter for the whole day.</li><li>I think she did give me extra meat though, so there 's always that.</li><li>Bland meat, terrible salsa ( I think that it 's just store bought jarred crap), no fresh pico de gallo.</li><li>They are little on the stingy side when it comes to the amount of meat they put in though.</li><li>Their meat is obviously kept and barely reheated.</li><li>It was literally half ' meat' and half noodles.</li><li>Tried the crispy pork that everyone recommends, it 's not bad, has crispy skin but the meat is on the dry side, definitely tried much better one elsewhere Since we came in 5, we got to try multiple dishes.</li><li>Best Lechon Kawali I 've had so far, tender meat and crispy skin, must order!</li><li>Despite the cold meat, the sauce in the shawarma really stood out.</li><li>The cuts of meat are low quality.</li><li>The quality of meat is good, thinly sliced and slightly rare and not covered in fat.</li><li>You also get a fair quantity of meat and noodles.</li><li>The meat they give you is barely anything and the rice is dry and tastes old.</li><li>Sushis and makis were delicious and this place was not stingy with the meat unlike some other places.</li><li>The beef short rib is usually my favourite, but this time the meat was too fatty.</li><li>Also the beef ribs were tasty but it had a lot of fat on it and very little meat therefore im eating 20% meat and 80% fat ..</li><li>Also the beef ribs were tasty but it had a lot of fat on it and very little meat therefore im eating 20% meat and 80% fat ..</li><li>We had:- Garlic fried rice It 's a must to soak up all the sauces- Lechon kawali ( roast pork) Crispy crackly skin and soft meat ...</li><li>- Pancit ( noodles) It was good with lots of meat, seafood and veggies, but my attention was focused on the top 3.</li><li>The house sauces are delicious, and seemed to work with every type of meat.</li><li>It was crispy as advertised but can be elevated further with more tender meat and crispier skin.</li><li>The meat was actually very tasty.</li><li>The food is simple but it 's all about the star of the plate, the meat! ( The seafood is fresh and delicious too) I ca n't really recommend anything specific as I 've tried pretty much everything on the menu and nothing has disappointed me.</li><li>Focus on the main attraction--the meat!</li><li>The portions are huge and food does n't taste like its the same sauce with different meat.</li><li>4) Beef short-ribs with pepper &amp; Garlic served on a hot plate- this was the only poor dish tonight, the meat was very tough and lacking significant flavour.</li><li>Sometimes their meat is good.</li><li>There was very little meat.</li><li>I have been to the Yorkdale food court a zillion times and the ingredients &amp; meat are consistently fresh, flavorful, and well-cooked/prepared.</li><li>The meat was dry, was not worth my money.</li><li>The soup base is tasty and a little bit spicy, the meat perfect.</li><li>The broth and meat is very good.</li><li>The quality of the meat was mostly fat.</li><li>My boyfriend had the spaghetti Bolognese, he said it was just ok and could not taste the meat.</li><li>The meat used did not need to be tenderized ( as many establishments do), and the preparation was good.</li><li>I liked the `` Meat Lovers'' the best!</li><li>However after being a regular of that place, one night they gave me a porkbone soup with VERY little meat and all bones.</li><li>The dumpling and rice cake soup was fantastic with a delicious soup and good dumplings and rice cakes and the spicy fiddlehead soup was hot and flavourful and full of meat and veggies.</li><li>I saw another table doing Korean BBQ with lettuce wrap so there is still a chance that I return, especially since Jennifer K. posted such a nice picture of marbleized meat.</li><li>3) kalbi ( beef short ribs)- really tender and generally good cuts of meat.</li><li>5) jap chae ( stir fried noodle with vegetables)- lots of veggies and meat, always comes out super hot and fresh, and never gets too ' sticky' or ' clumpy'. one of the best places for jap chae.</li><li>The meat also came with a large slice of onion.</li><li>There was a lot of mussels but the meat was tiny, the calamari was very soft, not tough to chew.</li><li>The meat was also not dry or chewy.</li><li>I loved the contrast between the crispy exterior and the tender meat.</li><li>The duck meat is prepared differently, more roasted and the meat literally flakes and falls off the bone, but so juicy!</li><li>The half fat half lean BBQ pork ( cha siu) have a good smoke, the meat is very soft and tender and the fat melts in your mouth.</li><li>The meat is so tender and glazed with charsiu sauce that made every little swirl around your mouth as you chew that much more wonderful.</li><li>Price wise look for it to top out around $ 12 for the 10 pieces of Cevappi on a bun with the `` fixins'', one you start eating these, they are seasoned and I normally do n't like lamb, but because of the mix of meat I am unable to detect the lamb from the other meats, which can be a good thing, if you 're like me and do n't like how grassy Lamb tastes.</li><li>I 've been going to this place a few years now, I 'm not sure if it 's been going downhill lately or it just happened that the last few times I 've been here the quality of the meat was extremely fat ( even tho they usually cut the fat off) All in all it 's a good place for a huge deli sandwich but it 's not cheap.</li><li>The pastrami and corned beef sandwiches are filled and full with meat but not with flavour.</li><li>I would n't have minded as much if he wore gloves while man-handling our meat and sandwiches ... but he did n't, and THAT is sick.</li><li>I actually started craving smoked meat after looking at the photos posted here and I was literally salivating looking at all that glorious meat.</li><li>Sadly, when I got back to my office with my sandwich less than 10 minutes later, I saw that it was filled with very dry meat, which tasted pretty average.</li><li>I was expecting a happy combination, giving me some lean and some juicy, fatty meat.</li><li>The pastrami was delicious, the service was amazing- every person we saw, from the gentleman who took our order and sliced the meat to the guy that cashed us out smiled and cracked jokes, making our experience awesome.</li><li>The meat was cooked perfectly.</li><li>This place is very overpriced for a sandwich, and both the meat and bread was very dry.</li><li>And while the meat is piled high, it 's mostly a trick of the eyes, as the rye bread is cut very small.</li><li>The meat was piled high and the salad and pickle were fresh and tasty.</li><li>The sandwiches are meaty, they stack up the meat but the rye accompanying the sandwich is rather small and you get an overwhelming mouthful of meat with little to no bread.</li><li>The meat however was good, very flavourful.</li><li>This place was good, sandwiches are piled high with meat, sides are good, everything is fairly priced.</li><li>So yeah, my mountain of meat tasted similar to what I would expect ass to taste like.</li><li>The sandwiches are about $ 10.00 which is kind of expensive when you are in a cafeteria style restaurant However the meat was fresh hot, moist and flavourful so we felt it was worth it.</li><li>The meat looked a little charred/burnt, but he said it tasted okay.</li><li>Fried chicken: Perfectly coated with the right amount of batter and moist, tender meat.</li><li>The meat is moist and juicy with lots of great jerk flavour.</li><li>BBQ buns which we THOUGHT were bbq pork buns, were good despite lacking the meat we were expecting.</li><li>Cooked just right so the meat was tender.</li><li>The meat was spiced well so a good thing to order if you are a big crowd.</li><li>Generally, all the dishes were boldly flavoured and the meat well-seasoned.</li><li>I only had lamb meat at this UYE, so I ca n't comment on the entrees of other type of meat.</li><li>The meat is savory and tender, but can get a bit over spiced.</li><li>The sesame flavor does n't really come out, but the meat is still very tender and savory.</li><li>What I ended up doing though is dunk pieces of skewer lamb into their handmade noodle soup so it made the soup a little spicier and the meat itself is now perfect.</li><li>Nothing crazy special, the meat is good compared to other places I have been.</li><li>The quality of the meat and chicken can be questionable sometimes tho.</li><li>It 's not the traditional `` thick'' tahina you may get some places ( it 's more of a watered-down liquid, in a squeeze bottle) but it 's still very tasty and in unlimited supply -- a group of 6 of us go through SEVERAL bottles of it when we 're there, putting it on everything -- the appetizers, the meat, the rice, everything.</li><li>The meat was old and had an expired taste to it.</li><li>I especially recommend the ' veggie platter with meat' ( actual menu item).</li><li>The vegetarian combo with meat ( hehe, funny name) is really good, where you get to try the dips, the tabouleh, the falafel, as well as a shawarma of your choosing ( the shawarma was so-so, but hey, if you gotta have meat ...).</li><li>I ordered the meat platter and the meat was dry and again NOT FRESH.</li><li>The meat unfortunately is dry on occasion.</li><li>All the meat was sitting right there in the body part and it was so sweet and the brains were delish!</li><li>4Ib the meat will get tough.</li><li>Huge portions for under $ 10 each with tender meat.</li><li>All of their meat was alive in the 90 's.</li><li>Wings sadly over cooked ( by a deep fryer no less), they need seasoning, the meat is bland.</li><li>I was just so bewildered by the meat ...</li><li>The vegetables on top were too tough to eat ( clearly very old). when I bit into the chicken, the meat was still pink inside.</li><li>What I mean is that there was just enough fat that the entire piece of meat was just meltingly juicy, but just not enough fat that I wanted to spit out a fat chunk.</li><li>Trust me, you wo n't miss the meat.</li><li>It was actually quite easy to get the meat from the shells.</li><li>Overall This place has a quality in the meat in comparison to places like Chako or Korean Grill house. the quality of meat is higher and closer to al la cart Korean BBQ places.</li><li>This restaurant since it is Korean owned and run unlike the other two, its style is much closer to that of Korean restaurants, and for those who 've had it, will know the difference in korean bbq styles. the one thing bad at this place is although it is all you can eat, it does not provide lettuce with it, and you have to pay $ 2 extra for each plate of lettuce you want. which makes Chako more attractive to a lot of people. because Chako at a similar price points offer more variety. for this reason i think it depends what you want. this palce the meat is decent, but the variety is very litle it only has 6 different type of meats to order. however if you want an authentic korean experience for korean bbq.</li><li>But all the meat is good, and if you and your friends are hungry, this will do the job.</li><li>My biggest criticism with the all you can eat menu here is that you cannot order lettuce or other sides which are typically used to `` wrap'' the meat as part of the menu.</li><li>They were thick but not too thick were you were curious to know if you were going to bite into raw meat or not.</li><li>However the quality of meat was really high and that was the reason we go to these in the first place.</li><li>My coworker had some kind of dish served in a round kettle where everything was separated: rice, meat, vegetables, etc but then you are supposed to mix it all together.</li><li>I find if you 're not ordering anything else, 1 order/person is just right. be prepared to smell like korean bbq or some kinda oily meat smell when you come out of the place, all your clothes, hair and everything will smell.</li><li>The owner there is trying to cut down food cost so much that the quality of meat and vegetables that are used here is horrible.</li><li>Lots of veggies, meat, starch.</li><li>Making a roast takes time because the meat needs to be `` slow-cooked'' to reduce the toughness and make it fall off the bone, plus you need the right combo of spices and veggies to bring out the flavour.</li><li>I have the Dinner ( chicken, pottos, meat, salad).</li><li>One side is for meat- smoked meat sandwiches, chicken fingers and other items I forget to remember.</li><li>The soup base and noodle are good but the meat itself is too dry, especially the beef.</li><li>Common problems of momos: dry, hard dough, not enough meat, too saucy meat, not saucy enough.</li><li>I admit I did n't complain or ask why there was so little meat but seems kind of odd to be missing it.</li><li>Absolutely awful and uninspiring, the noodle does have big bowl, but minimal meat and potato cubes ( wtf ?) nothing special at all, Not fresh and tasteless ( it 's like having a mouthful of vinegar).</li><li>The egg tomato dish was nothing special while the beef stew brisket was amazing with tender slices of meat.</li><li>Crispy skin and well-cooked meat on the inside.</li><li>Their cooked dinner was not as flavourful as it could have been and the meat was on the dry side.</li><li>The meat was tender and moist, the rye bread was fresh, the fries were crispy, and the coleslaw and pickle were just right.</li><li>Deli sandwiches- You can choose from four or five types of meat.</li><li>Skin is crispy as you 'd like, the meat moist and juicy and not at all greasy.</li><li>Ordered the peking duck 2-course special and it was amazing, the duck was cooked perfectly, the skin was crispy, the meat was tender with just the right amount of fat.</li><li>The meat itself was flavourful.</li><li>Then, we had an assortment of dishes including fried pork cutlets, fried green beans, tofu, beef and onion, Chicken with sprinkled garlic and for me, vegetarian dumplings ( but no meat).</li><li>The double fried lobster the tail has lots of meat.</li><li>The skin is crisp, meat is tender and juicy and each piece carved with just the right amount of meat.</li><li>The skin is crisp, meat is tender and juicy and each piece carved with just the right amount of meat.</li><li>The meat is juicy but not fatty.</li><li>The meat is lean enough without losing flavour or tenderness and the sauce is great.</li><li>The STEAK SANDWICH is still good although the slices of meat were inconsistent with my first try.</li><li>The meat was lean but had enough of its natural fat to keep it very moist and juicy.</li><li>The beef was braised nicely, the meat was tenderly split apart and not tough at all.</li><li>They use charcoal so the flavour of the meat is amazing !!</li><li>I ordered the pork bibimbap, it 's just rice, vegetables, and there was n't that much meat.</li><li>I was n't a fan of their beef bulgogi, as I found the meat to be very tough and chewy, but I 've had no other problems.</li><li>The meat is very succulent and meaty they have half potatoes in and lots of spices the meat pieces are tenser and cooked right the soup and smooth and spicy at the same time.</li><li>The meat is generally tender and well mariniated.</li><li>The beef was top quality and you can tell by how marbleized the meat was with fat.</li><li>It 's a meal for two with lots of meat, lettuce, soon tofu soup, and rice.</li><li>There was also extremely little meat on the bone.</li><li>Some meat was tender while others were way too tough.</li><li>I should have gotten that as the meat was so tender and there were some nice thick pieces as well.</li><li>The meat was very meaty.</li><li>Not very spicy nor very salty compared to some of the other places I 've been but I 'm more about the fall-off-the-bone meat.</li><li>In that aspect, meat was very tender!</li><li>The skin was crispy and the meat was tender and the natural fish oils were plentiful.</li><li>The meat is moist, flavourful from keeping the bones in.</li><li>The chicken skin was indeed crispy and perfectly spiced, and the meat was juicy on the inside.</li><li>The butter chicken came in a small container and the meat had a lot of fatty pieces.</li><li>Deep Fried Duck Chin ( $ 4.95)- You do need the skill and the patient to eat those chins, as all the good meat are just in between all the bones ...</li><li>S &amp; S ribs were hard and had the look of an old-marinated/preserved meat, if you remove the red sauce.</li><li>The jerk chicken was a bit bland and the meat was a bit tough to eat.</li><li>The goat was better, where the meat fell off the bones and the curry flavour was cooked into the meat.</li><li>The meat also tasted odd.</li><li>I only get pho, the shrimp rolls both with no meat and durian shake it 's the best !!</li><li>Should have more meat, veggies inside Rare beef and chicken pho ( small): fresh, lots of meat, noodles, great portion.</li><li>Should have more meat, veggies inside Rare beef and chicken pho ( small): fresh, lots of meat, noodles, great portion.</li><li>I was not impressed with the meat ...</li><li>I always getting the Pho rare beef and brisket which comes with plentiful meat and noodle, you can also definitely tell they 've stewed the soup base at least for a night or so.</li><li>They are also very good about using different slicers for vegan, vegetarian, fish and meat.</li><li>Loved the sliced and tasty meat.</li><li>The meat was poorly cooked, and the portion size laughable, it was atop a mound of bean sprouts making this dish look larger than it was.</li><li>There 's only a tiny bit of meat in the bibimbab thought, if ur a meat lover probably u wo n't enjoy it as much.</li><li>Do n't fret, the kimchi option still has some sort of meat inside.</li><li>And the food were also very bad as the shrimp and meat were both very cheap quality ingredients I will never come here again knowing there are much better choices in the same area.</li><li>I think you gotta try this place if you are into Korean food in anyway as the soups are extremely flavourful and the meat is tender and cooked perfectly.</li><li>Soup, tofu, raw egg ( it cooks in the hot broth), kimchi, meat, rice and a few side dishes.</li><li>Onto the food:- the meat and brisket they serve with the soup is delicious, however I found the broth a bit bland- purple rice is very very good. i had the seafood soon tofu.</li><li>I would go again if I were craving soon tofu but I would like to try out the bulgogi there as well. this stuff is addictive .. simple menu, u just pick either the soup or the meat, or bibimbop ... and go from there .. but i tell u, whatever u choose u wo n't regret .. i had bibimbop and soft tofu soup with the seafood .. was fantastic .. i was so full but had to finish everything .. was that good .. usually packed so def recommend going off peak time ..</li><li>The meat was well seasoned as compared to other places that may just leave it tasting plain.</li><li>It would be good if they offer meat alternative option at no charge.</li><li>The meat was good, but it was n't extraordinary or anything.</li><li>The meat comes pre-seasoned and and the vegetables are drenched in soy sauce and salted garlic butter.</li><li>It 's assembly-line style ordering: type of tortitlla, type of meat ( I 've had pulled pork), toppings like veggies, cheese, guac ( EXTRA $ $), sour cream, and type of salsa ( warning: the hot IS hot).</li><li>The meat is plain and the rice overcooked, and there 's little in the way of interesting herbs, sauces, or salsa to liven it up.</li><li>The meat was so hard to cut and chew.</li><li>A lot of tender meat, enough veggies and a potato ( `` gamja'') was there.</li><li>The meat is so tender it 's legitimately falling off the bone and the broth was n't too salty.</li><li>The dumplings had a great crunch to them and the meat tasted spiced and juicy.</li><li>It was so flavourless, not spicy, meat was soft but no pork flavour.</li><li>Definitely my favourite place to go to satisfy my pork bone craving, although sometimes the meat is dry, and for a decent price.</li><li>Well on bright side meat is unhealthy especially pork so I tend to think oh well I ate less of bad thing..</li><li>It 's got this awesome sweet soup that is filled with sweet meat, mushrooms, some noodles, and a few greens ( leeks ?).</li><li>There was plenty of noodles, and meat however, so it was filling, just not tasty.</li><li>The skins were thin, the meat was flavourful, they were served hot- all the basics were covered.</li><li>The meat is tender and moist and is so flavourful, and even when I bring the left-overs home and re-heat in the microwave, the meat is still great!</li><li>The meat is tender and moist and is so flavourful, and even when I bring the left-overs home and re-heat in the microwave, the meat is still great!</li><li>The fish although was first deep fried had a surprising super moist flakey meat!</li><li>EKK: S Spare Ribs Wuxi style looks decent, meat is dry and meat texture is tough.</li><li>String beans with garlic- standard Pan fried dumplings- standard Shau mai- standard Soup dumplings- did n't try as they were eaten by the rest of the family before I had a chance to get one Soup dumplings with crab egg- good but not sure worth the additional price Beef noodle soup- I liked the broth as it was spicy and thick ( not watered down lacking flavor) and the meat was extremely tender falling apart as you bite Chicken with mango and onions- my brother described it as sweet and sour chicken with pureed mango.</li><li>Asian Legend does it very nicely as the skin is crisp and salted, while the meat was juicy.</li><li>The meat here is n't as tasty as the one at Steeles Ave, but hell, it 's still great.</li><li>It has the perfect amount of sauce and meat, super filling!</li><li>The sandwiches were enormous, stuffed with lots of meat, big pieces of onions and hot peppers ( they are super hot with the seeds in) It was an impossible sandwich to finish, so you can definitely get two meals out of one if your not a big eater.</li><li>The piece of chicken was thinly breaded, more meat to breading and the piece of meat was huge.</li><li>The piece of chicken was thinly breaded, more meat to breading and the piece of meat was huge.</li><li>The meat is thin and tender, not too much sauce and flavour was good and not too salty!</li><li>I got a beef dol pot bibimbap, it was kinda disappointing cuz they gave very less meat and a lot of veggie to make it look big.</li><li>Food: I ordered the Beef stew, the meat was a tad chewier than my previous times at the Nak Won by FMP, but here they definitely were really generous with the portion size.</li><li>Good if guys thinks that smelling like meat is sexy, maybe my dog would think so ?!</li><li>Bibimbap: SLIMY and little meat.</li><li>The portion of pork was big with about 3-4 mammoth sized bones full of meat.</li><li>The meat itself was not fall off the bone tender but still had a nice flavour.</li><li>It took us so long for us to wave down the server each time to: 1. order 2. get water 3. ask for more gas in our canister 4. remind her of the fact we are still waiting for new gas canisters ( while raw meat is half cooked on the grill) which was suppose to be table cooking style but because she was so busy, she dumped the whole plate of meat on the table grill and left it sitting there before we realize they started cooking but wanted us to finish cooking.</li><li>This place has the best meat on the bones and good amount of apps.</li><li>Set meal for limited meat for $ 55 !!</li><li>The meat was tender and juicy, the rice was great too.</li><li>The meat was not fresh and Barg Kabab was not tasting good.</li><li>I ordered lamb shank with dill rice and it was a very large portion -- meat was very tender and the rice was good, not too oily at all which I find is the problem with some other places I otherwise like.</li><li>I 've seen better for cheaper; the meat here is tasteless.</li><li>Because my curry did not come with rice ( I realize some places make you order rice seperate, which is annoying, so I only blamed myself for not remembering to ask if I needed to order rice), I tried to use some of his noodles, and I am vegetarian so I went to pick out the bits of meat and seafood.</li><li>My friends who eat fish/ meat said everything that they ordered tasted great and was good quality.</li><li>The bowls were of decent size but the meat was almost non existent.</li><li>The meat is extremely dry and very salty.</li><li>Slippery disgusting tasteless meat.</li><li>This was basically the back and forth of the conversation- he also told me that the mystery meat was probably beef and I should n't worry- hello I am a vegetarian man!</li><li>There is not much to choose from if you are a vegetarian or eat halal meat.</li><li>All the meat was dry and the best meat was the wings, but that was even fairly average. they do have free refills on drinks and the server was rather attentive and nice. but the food and the atmosphere does n't cut it for me to want to come back.</li><li>All the meat was dry and the best meat was the wings, but that was even fairly average. they do have free refills on drinks and the server was rather attentive and nice. but the food and the atmosphere does n't cut it for me to want to come back.</li><li>The small bowl of beans, coleslaw and a piece of cornbread does n't come close to compensating for the lack of meat.</li><li>We both found our meat fell right off the bone and something especially wonderful to me was that I was able to order dry ribs with BBQ sauce on the side.</li><li>Take a cut into the meat, a quick glance will tell you everything, you are looking to see if you can see a `` pinkish ring'' around the outer circumference of your meat known as the SMOKE RING and in the case of Memphis Style .. it doesnt exist!</li><li>I 'm not a huge `` smoked meat'' guy, but my understanding was the meat should be especially tender.</li><li>This is a simple sandwich that should n't need too much garnish if the meat is done right.</li><li>Every piece was cut up into uneven chunks and we could barely see the meat because the amount of fat on each piece was literally an inch thick.</li><li>The bits of meat we were able to eat were really tough and chewy.</li><li>The beef ribs had 3 1/2 bones ( 1/2 because one of them was really small and had next to no meat) and it had more fat than I would have liked ( and less meat), but it was marinated really well.</li><li>Our four course meal consisted of cold and warm appetizers, followed by a fish and meat course.</li><li>It was a thick slice composed of 80% fat and gristle and about 20% meat.</li><li>This is not your usual BBQ ribs where the BBQ sauce is grilled on it so I was scared it was gonna be dry. but it actually amazed me !! even tho i ordered the sauce on the side I didnt need it cuz it was sooo flavourful and the meat was so tender it shocked me.</li><li>I looked past the grease and artificially spongy meat because i was starving and I needed just that after exercising.</li><li>The actual 8 oz slab of meat was lifeless and tough- which might as well be when the rest would have gone to waste.</li><li>We had to flag down our waiter to place an order for our appetizer and when we placed our food order, it came and the meat was cooked just right &amp; the sides were obviously counted ....</li><li>The meat.</li><li>The meat was good as well, but took us a long time to cook it because there was something wrong with the gas and fire.</li><li>They have a great selection of vegetables, meat, tofu and condiments.</li><li>First of all, the meat quality was good compared to what you usually get.</li><li>You can choose your veggies, your meat and your sauce and voila you have what I call stir steamed veggies within under 2 minutes.</li><li>You select meat, veggies, sauces and they cook it in front of you.</li><li>Start with a bowl and add meat.</li><li>A lot of choices, vegetables and meat are fresh.</li><li>It was crazy good and unlike congee from some places that may use the parts of the chicken rejected by KFC, this place uses primo meat!</li><li>Most meals are a combination of meat with a bit of veggies over rice or noodles or sorts.</li><li>There are over 15 main entrees one can choose from including pasta, meat, fish and pizzas.</li><li>We got something similar to a tortilla chip with some veggies in a spicy sauce to dip. ( Not sure what it is called but it was good) I plan on going again to try their lunch buffet! we ordered dinner for two when we stopped by. had bad experience with other buffet style indian food in the past- everything seems a lot more watered down. some of the stuff was good in the pre-fixe menu, some are kinda weird. i liked the tandori chicken and the lamb stew thing. grilled shrimp was mediocre. the long log of some sort of meat was not very good. naan was fresh and crispy so that was a plus. had some leftovers to take home for the next day even. food is alright, not fantastic.</li><li>The meat is tender and moist ( apologies to those who hate this word) and it 's seasoned with red onions, coriander ( aka Cilantro), parsley ( aka Italian cilantro, just kidding) and from what I recall, paprika, pepper and cumin ...</li><li>All in all, a great tasting meat.</li><li>My eggs and meat were delicious!</li><li>Had the king ramen and the meat was so tender my god.</li><li>Real thick turkey and not paper thin like subway or Quiznos, you can actually taste the meat.</li><li>The bread is amazing, the lettuce is better, the meat is way better, they put like 10ibs of bacon on the turkey bacon, and it 's GOOD bacon ...</li><li>A foot of carbs, meat and cheese, for about 1/3 of what a movie ticket will run you these days is incredible.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
