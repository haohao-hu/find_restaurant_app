<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 20' %><h2>chicken<br />occurrence: 350</h2><div><ol><li>They have a ton of other items from sandwiches, meatloaf, chicken, soups, bagels, and even Montreal Smoked meat.</li><li>I told the waitress `` NO ONIONS, NO EGGS, NO CHICKEN, NO BEEF, NO SEAFOOD, and NO GREEN PEPPERS ( the green peppers was a choice).''</li><li>Great service, great price, fantastic food, fava beans were incredible and chicken is moist and delicious.</li><li>But recently, we tried Friday- the lunch special, chicken was so dry; I think they cooked a huge batch of chicken and put sauce on top when orders came.</li><li>The chicken was virtually tasteless, except salty in a watery sauce. the vegetable was in the same type of sauce as well.</li><li>They conceded that the crust was good, but their pizza was bland and the chicken was dry.</li><li>The toppings were also plentiful and excellently prepared- tasty tofu, chicken, shrimp, onion, pepper and peanut.</li><li>The chef had basically de-boned a whole chicken, roasted it till it was perfectly done -- the chicken was moist and tender, but the skin crispy -- including the stuffing which was pearly white tender grains of rice.</li><li>We ordered have had almost all they had on their menu, my favorite nontheless is their chicken and lamb shish kebob.</li><li>The chicken seems like a lower grade now somehow.</li><li>The Chicken finally came, and immediately my friend and I froze.</li><li>Moist and flavourful, and the chicken ( I tried a bite ..</li><li>The chicken was lightly seasoned and pretty good.</li><li>My sister got the chicken pita the chicken has a strange taste.</li><li>The chicken was juicy but the marinate could be more flavourful.</li><li>The chicken was not breaded and was tossed with a very mild black bean sauce.</li><li>We picked the chicken option which comes with chicken wings, sweet and sour chicken, chicken chow mein, chicken fried rice and two egg rolls.</li><li>And it was like $ 7 in my opinion not really worth it, the chicken was very dry and not seasoned well.</li><li>All the food here is good- tempura is well fried, chicken tasted like organic ( not sure it is, but it was so good!), and all the fish tasted so fresh and satisfying.</li><li>Only cons:- chicken tasted a bit like tofu ( strange ....)</li><li>The Spicy Chicken Dinner is served with a delicious citrus-laced salad and flavourful miso soup to start followed by a platter of skinless, spicy, saucy chicken on a bed of well-seasoned vegetables ( mainly onions).</li><li>This is served with a side of plain rice but the chicken is delicious enough to eat on its own!</li><li>The customer service was 10/10, the waitress saw me struggling to eat the chicken, so she asked me if I would like her to help me open up the chicken and eat it the proper way.</li><li>The chicken was tender, with rice in the middle.</li><li>The chicken was rough and overcooked.</li><li>It came out a lot faster than i thought it would! i read in other comments of wishing for a bigger menu, but if they are specializing, the argument is better quality control on what they make. there were six side dishes served with the bubbling hot soup. the chicken had glutinous rice, one piece of fresh ginseng that was full of flavour if you eat it, and one red date. caution: the date has its seed, you could hurt yourself if you bite down too fast too hard on that date. there was also one chestnut ( peeled of course) as well inside the glutinous rice. the waitress left a container lined with a plastic bag -- where chicken bones, red date seed, etc can be discarded. she also added a small dish with noodles to add into the boiling broth. chicken was slide off the bone and the glutinous rice was perfect. the chestnut seemed a little underdone, but i really enjoyed the soup, some may find it a little bland -- there is salt ( might even be sea salt) and black pepper to their soup. i liked it as it was and finished it to the last drop. side dishes: cubes of daikon kimchi, salad of lettuce woth red cabbage with this black sesame dressing, sweet soy fried xubes of potato, sweet pickled julienned slivers of daikon and carrot, marinaded fish cake with green pepper and a cucumber/zucchini marinaded with gochujang and sesame seeds etc. definitely full with a warm belly from this meal. planning this winter to come again and try other things on the menu. especially other ginseng soup options!</li><li>My friend 's soup was really good, flavourful and the chicken was so tender.</li><li>The chicken was ultra tender and was falling off the bones, making it a pretty easy meal.</li><li>Nevertheless the chicken soup itself- the chicken was so silky and soft- I 'm craving another one already!</li><li>The chicken is super tender but did not have a whole lot of flavour either.</li><li>Whole chicken was very moist, soft, fall-off-the-bone.</li><li>Inside the chicken is stuffed with sticky rice and a date.</li><li>The chicken was very tender and soft but the ginseng was very subtle unless you get to the sticky rice filling where you find the ginseng, korean date, and chestnut.</li><li>Inside the chicken is some stuffing consisting of rice, a date, and a small piece of ginseng.</li><li>The chicken has been cooking in the soup for a very long time.</li><li>The chicken is fall off the bone, but because it 's been cooking for so long it 's become quite dry and tasteless really.</li><li>The chicken is organic, stuffed with sticky rice on the inside and comes with a small side of rice noodles which you can place in the soup.</li><li>They added a few different soups that are not chicken but beef, and not just any beef, it 's beef intestines and/or blood pudding.</li><li>The chicken soup had about half a chicken and the broth was really clean and light in flavouring.</li><li>None of us went for the seemingly notorious ginger chicken, but from what I can recall, the sweet and sour chicken balls, the fried dumplings, the chicken thing my gal ordered, and the crispy beef were all delicious, served fast, and priced right.</li><li>The best dish was probably the chicken, nice crispy outside and tender inside.</li><li>For the beef of course, but also to revisit the other chicken and shrimp dishes I sampled.</li><li>The Singapore noodle was excellent, lots of chicken, pork, and shrimp!</li><li>But the food is absolutely wonderful. we are regular customer, s at this restaurant, Tonight we ordered the usual, our favourte dish is peanut chicken, we brought our three dish, s home and upon opening the chicken we saw half the dish was peanut sauce and less than half the usual amount of chicken, I called the restaurant and spoke to the owner for ten minutes, she insisted that it was made the same as always, It was not at all, we paid 11,95 for peanut sauce and a small amount of chicken,, The arrogant owner could not care less, refusing to credit us for next time we picked up, or d delivering a new dish to our home, This place the staff is unfriendly, not well mannered, and horrible customer service, and the food was awful, except for the fried rice, it was good, If your looking for bad service this is the place to go, the customer is never right,, be warned,.</li><li>My go-to order here is the Chicken Shawarma Plate.</li><li>The guys behind the counter here are pretty generous with the amount of rice, vegetables ( e.g. lettuce, pickel, onions, beets), and chicken they pile on your plate.</li><li>The chicken is shaved off a rotating cooker, and re-grilled right before serving, which means the meat stays tender but hot on your plate.</li><li>Perhaps I did n't add enough sauce and spreads to my wrap, but I still thought the chicken was on the drier side.</li><li>The service and quality of food is extremely disappointing as chicken was their only option since they burned their beef.</li><li>The chicken itself has a pretty good flavor, but the wilted lettuce and sorry looking toppings always have me disappointed, and somehow there were fruit flies buzzing around all the veggies even though it 's- 4 degrees out ..</li><li>I 've tried both the chicken and beef thinking that maybe I was picking the wrong kind of meat.</li><li>The chicken is always juicy and fresh- The reason being is that they have lots of customers and when they are slow they turn down the roaster on the spike and when they get a rush of customers they turn it back on and make sure u get fresh juicy meat right off the spike!</li><li>The chicken in the shawarma was very good.</li><li>The chicken in both these dishes wasnt cut up properly, the broccoli pieces were the size of my fist ... i could go go on ...</li><li>I do n't mean to imply the chicken was undercooked to the point it was raw.</li><li>The chicken was tender and yummy.</li><li>The melt-in-your-mouth goat curry is my usual order, but the chicken is awesome and the channa and spinach is so good and perfect for when you 're feeling a little vegetarian.</li><li>The pieces of chicken were big pieces and i had a bite of chicken in every bite.</li><li>This left the chicken, rice, peppers, peanuts, and other veggies like broccoli and cauliflower.</li><li>MY CHICKEN WASN' T COOKED.</li><li>Got it home and I said, `` Gee, this chicken looks a little moist ...''</li><li>The chicken is battered and fried in a light and crispy batter that held up to the sauce very well.</li><li>The chicken was perfectly cooked with a nice thick sauce that had a wonderful flavor.</li><li>It was not bad: the chicken was moist and tasty ( even better with the gingery dipping sauce) and the rice could have been more flavorful but ok.</li><li>From looking at the menu, I thought the chicken is boneless but no I was wrong.</li><li>So I thought if it has bone then the chicken should be flavourful.</li><li>The chicken is not fresh, I could taste the chicken was left in the fridge for awhile.</li><li>The chicken is not fresh, I could taste the chicken was left in the fridge for awhile.</li><li>HUGE pieces of LEAN chicken, clean Thai basil and Vietnamese greens, ( including bean sprouts), and the tables and condiments are always clean.</li><li>The chicken was a tad dry too.</li><li>The chicken is moist and very flavourful and the rice and peas was actually quite good!</li><li>Very little amount of rice and chicken, bottom of the container soaking in oil after we finished.</li><li>Not sure if it 's the Cajun but this chicken is so addictive!</li><li>The chicken is great and as expected.</li><li>Only reason they get 1 star is because the chicken was fresh.</li><li>30 mins later back home, the chicken was super hot and juicy, dripping with chicken goodness ( not oil) with each bite.</li><li>The chicken and pork souvlaki are very tasty.</li><li>It had chicken, rice, two types of potatoes, salad, tzatziki, and pita.</li><li>The chicken was delicious but dried out.</li><li>Merely 10 minutes from picking it up, the pesto became very oily and the chicken was a bit dry.</li><li>The chicken was perfectly done and here the sauce brought out the taste of the chicken.</li><li>I do n't expect much for $ 8 so I am not complaining- the chicken yakitori served steaming hot! fogging up my camera .. the sauce is a little sweet, but the chicken was nice and moist Kiyomizu seems to be really popular with the office workers in the area during lunch time, every tables were occupied by the time I left.</li><li>Let me say that I enjoyed their chicken and poutine.</li><li>The chicken had a nice taste to it and was not watery like KFC but neither was it crunchy like Popeyes.</li><li>I drop in for their chicken whenever I 'm in their neighborhood which is n't too often unfortunately.</li><li>Unfortunately an entire half of the chicken was gristle/connective tissue/inedible.</li><li>The chicken is crispy outside and juicy inside.</li><li>What is also notable about the way they prepare their chicken ( unlike all other chicken chains I can think of) is that all pieces are trimmed of excess fat and skin prior to preparation.</li><li>The portion is giant, the chicken is tender with crispy edges, they way I like it!</li><li>Big portions Actually fresh and tender chicken Get the diner plate Friendly dude that service.</li><li>The chicken is always fresh ( they usually run out after lunch time and pop on a new skewer of chicken).</li><li>I LOVED the potatoes and the chicken was cooked perfectly.</li><li>This place has one of the best chicken and beef skewers in the area; very juicy and large portions.</li><li>Not the fanciest place around, BUT: the size of the pita pocket was HUGE, the chicken tasty, the vegetables definitely fresh, the hummous could have used a bit more garlic and lemon juice.</li><li>The chicken is moist.</li><li>The chicken was tender and the coleslaw was creamy which made for such a wonderful combination.</li><li>Also, the chicken had a nice little char ( not burnt) texture on it which makes the outer layer almost crispy.</li><li>But you definitely should go here for the Sh awarma plate because it is so delicious and huge! popped in here during lunch, and of course it 's because I was craving my New York style chicken on the rocks. the portion was huge but it was n't satisfying. the rice was over cooked but the chicken was good- I was looking for that perfect garlic sauce but it was n't enough in the meal.</li><li>Our daughter was thoroughly satisfied with her chicken tender platter and apple crispy a la mode dessert, which I forcibly shared with her.</li><li>The chicken is nice and chunky and the salad is a good mix, try it with honey mustard dressing.</li><li>The chicken was so juicy and tender.</li><li>Their meat is tender and tasty as is their chicken.</li><li>The chicken is really really good.</li><li>I ordered the roasted chicken dinner, and the chicken was mushy.</li><li>Either way, the mushy chicken was n't fun, so I would n't recommend the roasted chicken leg dinner here.</li><li>It 's not THAT good, it 's messy as heck ( the chicken and slaw fall out into the bag), and it 's gone up in price twice since I started going there.</li><li>The chicken was not too spicy and super moist, while the rice and peas had great flavour, and OMG the home made coleslaw!</li><li>Both items came out to about 5 dollars so definitely a good buy !! the chicken was very juicy and hot ( temperature), which made the sandwich that much better.</li><li>The spice of the chicken, the creaminess of the coleslaw and the sweetness of the bread.</li><li>I admit the coco bread was fresh, the slaw was a nice addition, however the chicken could be spicier.</li><li>I usually get a small pork, small chicken, two patties, and a coleslaw to share between two people.</li><li>The chicken was soft and delicious, even the smell was nice.</li><li>I ordered kafta plate with rice and chicken and beef shawarma plate with rice.</li><li>The chicken was not that hot and it was very bland compared to what I generally come to expect when I visit Paramount.</li><li>Chicken Shawarma Sandwich- Shredded pieces of chicken grilled on a rotating spit with shredded lettuce, pickles and garlic sauce wrapped in a pita I really loved this, and chicken is usually at the bottom of my meat list.</li><li>The chicken was very tender and tasty and the sauce just brings out the delicious flavour without overpowering the chicken.</li><li>The chicken was very tender and tasty and the sauce just brings out the delicious flavour without overpowering the chicken.</li><li>I do n't think South Street even marinate their chicken ...</li><li>On my first try, the cook severely overcooked the chicken.</li><li>The chicken tasted ok but was swimming in its own grease as oil from the chinese sausage bled onto the lotus leaf as well.</li><li>Chicken Parmigiano with Penne marinara: portion, price, and the size of the chicken was more than enough.</li><li>The chicken is moist and exterior crisp.</li><li>The broth was very nice but the chicken had slimy pieces of skin on it which do n't look appetizing and do n't have a texture I like.</li><li>The chicken itself was not freshly cooked.</li><li>Samgyetang is also on the Menu if you want the Whole Chicken to yourself.</li><li>Then when the chicken is ready, the waitress would come and cut it up and serve that to you ..... then you wait again for the noodle to be cooked ... and she came back and serve you again .... then you wait for the congee to be cook, and now you have this congee that has all the nutrients from the chicken and ginseng that suppose to be really good for you ?!</li><li>Then when the chicken is ready, the waitress would come and cut it up and serve

nutrients from the chicken and ginseng that suppose to be really good for you ?!</li><li>The chicken has no taste, the soup had no taste, ca n't even see any ginseng in it._________________________________________________ It 's a very authentic and humble place.</li><li>The chicken is tender but not too tasty.</li><li>The glutinous rice that is stuffed in the chicken was stewed with ginseng and herbs, and it is steeped with the rich flavours of chicken and of course, the deep richness of ginseng.</li><li>The chicken was delicious as well.</li><li>The chicken was breaded and deep fried like KFC 's but for whatever reason, this chicken came out greasy and heavy tasting.</li><li>Ordered the garlic rice, kare kare, and crispy chicken in house sauce.</li><li>The chicken in the wrap was not moist, and seemed quite dry.</li><li>Loved the tasty chicken and shrimp Pad Thai, and Vietnamese spring rolls ...</li><li>The chicken was good, but nothing overly special.</li><li>I think ...). love this pizza place! handsdown BEST EVER. i like thin pizza with lots of variety. i always ask for a little extra cooking so i can have crunch from the crust. gawd. love it here! chicken wings also amazing, comparable to popeyes or kfc. highly highly recommend.</li><li>I ordered their Chicken Teriyaki which came with a bowl of rice, miso soup and side dishes of potato, zucchini and sprouts.</li><li>The chicken was tender and cooked perfectly with just the right amount of grill on the meat ... smothered in teriyaki sauce and served over a bed of onions in a cast iron ... umm ... cow.</li><li>Great Chicken, great gravy.</li><li>Got several lunch specials ( 1/4 chicken, coleslaw, rice with peas and gravy) and the Jamaican patty.</li><li>The chicken was absolutely delicious, nice and spicy and the rice and peas were great with the gravy.</li><li>The chicken is tender.</li><li>I loved the chicken I order as part of my fixed price menu- but the pasta appetizer just was that much better.</li><li>The food is decent too, we have the sweet and spicy chicken, seafood pancake, spicy seafood with rice cake.</li><li>I had the Chimichanga and it was very good, fresh and the chicken was so tender.</li><li>The quality of chicken was atrocius ... it was extremely dry- as if they used it from a frozen packet.</li><li>The chimichanga was very interesting- I guess the chicken was fried first and then they deep fry the tortilla once they put the chicken inside.</li><li>Pros: Amazing food, fast service, clean, and very cheap Cons: Can be pretty busy at lunch ... but I guess that 's an indicator that people really love this restaurant Recommendations: Congee- all of them are amazing General Tao Chicken- I 'm Filipino/Canadian and you know we love GT chicken!</li><li>We had the deep fried tentacles, some kind of rice with mushrooms, chicken and bok choi ( one of those green things that people steam ?) and it came in a hot bowl so that the rice at the botton was sticky and crunchy at the same time: D Also had the vermicelli that 's part of the special, congee with surf clam, choy sum with oyster sauce, hot and sour soup, my friend has the cheung fun and rice roll with duck in it, and rice cake with cabbage and some pork.</li><li>Rice with mushrooms- no. i do n't like this. i do n't really like rice that much and the chicken was bland.</li><li>Ordered: Dak-Gal-Bee ( JS-1) 4/5* Chicken ( boneless dark meat) and assorted vegetables ( cabbage, sweet potato and greeon onion)* Choose your spiciness ( we went with B. The Joons Original Spicy Sauce)* $ 9.25 per portion ( 2 portions minimum), we ordered 3 portions for 3 people* Extra Add On: rice cake, mozzarella cheese, instant noodle, vegetables and fried rice* Extra add ons are all $ 2 except the fried rice* Everything is thrown together and comes to your table uncooked* Because it 's chicken, they take a while to fully cook and it drives you crazy* Servers will come around and cook them for you so do n't worry about the process* If you order mozarella cheese, they come midway and add it on near the end* For 3 portion order, I found there were n't much chicken* Original spicy sauce is not spicy at all !!</li><li>I liked the creamy corn sauce, but thought there may have been too much fat on the chicken.</li><li>It does n't take much to recognize that the cream sauce came out of a can, the chicken likely frozen bits but hey! the smoked salmon was generous slice.</li><li>The chicken was relish and the mango sauce was surprisingly nice.</li><li>That is what a foodie like me calls heaven when people just come around and offer you free amazing food constantly:) But I was n't there for the chicken, oh no no no. I saw the beef shawarma, or shall I say, smelled it from a mile away:) It is a rare luxury to see a fresh .. succulent ( i feel dirty lol) ... beef shawarma grilling ... glistening on that hot turning stand lol yeah this is starting to sound a little raunchy, i know!</li><li>It came with a miso soup, edamame, and the bento box ( rice, salad, chicken, tofu, japchae). everything was average; the sauce on the chicken teriyaki was overpowering.</li><li>The chicken was very tender.</li><li>It had some sweet from the sauce and citrus fruit, some bulk from the chicken and cashew.</li><li>Vermicelli Soup: Nice light soup with nice cut chicken pieces, tofu, carrots, lettuce and of course vermicelli ...</li><li>Beef was tender, the butter chicken was flavorful and the cheese naan was unlike anything I 've ever tried!</li><li>The lamb curry was terrible, and the TANDOORI chicken were two crappy dehydrated old drumsticks.</li><li>I order off the special menu-chili chicken, wonton soup and an egg roll.</li><li>The chicken is battered and coated in a decent, slightly sweet but mostly hot sauce.</li><li>We got fish &amp; tofu, chicken and broccoli, and rice.</li><li>I have had the chicken and beef skewers.</li><li>The chicken was juicy and full of flavour.</li><li>From chicken and rice to lamb shank to beef stew.</li><li>My pasta was well cooked, but the chicken tasted like something you would find in a McDonald 's salad and the mushrooms were good, but that was the basis of the dish.</li><li>The chicken was seasoned well enough, and the portion was large, but the pasta was nothing special as it was dried pasta, and the vegetables seemed like it was from frozen.</li><li>The chicken is tender and thick, topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella, &amp; parmesan cheese.</li><li>The chicken is still amazing the next day.</li><li>All the veggies were raw and the chicken was half-cooked so it took awhile for everything in the hotpot to to be fully cooked, but it was worth the wait!</li><li>The chicken was flavourful and tender, and the spiciness level was just right.</li><li>The spicy fried chicken was amazing and so was the pork bone soup.</li><li>The food was horrible, the chicken was under cooked, too sour, it was not stuffed with anything and it came with bones! spinach was below the chicken and the cheese was melted on top of the chicken chew skin: (, half a spoon of mashed potato that did not taste good and couple of carrots scattered around the dish.</li><li>The food was horrible, the chicken was under cooked, too sour, it was not stuffed with anything and it came with bones! spinach was below the chicken and the cheese was melted on top of the chicken chew skin: (, half a spoon of mashed potato that did not taste good and couple of carrots scattered around the dish.</li><li>The chicken was perfectly cooked and juicy.</li><li>The chicken was tender and the pieces were decently sized but this dish was nothing special.</li><li>Usually the chicken is mixed in with the curry.</li><li>The chicken was very tender, which I really enjoyed.</li><li>The dice was nice, but had only 5 thin pcs of an already small chicken.</li><li>And their curry chicken now uses some frozen, tasteless chicken from God knows where.</li><li>The chicken was pretty rough.</li><li>The curry had very weak flavour and the chicken was low quality, something I 'd expect from a fast food restaurant.</li><li>Would be a 5 if there was extra curry sauce and maybe if it was chicken AND shrimp rather than just one.</li><li>The chicken was really bland, and it had a really interesting/weird soft texture.</li><li>Our go to items are usually BBQ pork, roasted pork if they have ribs and half a chicken.</li><li>The upkeep is horrible, they might not have chicken, coleslaw, or any other damn thing you might find at a West Indian restaurant, but when they do, boy but when they do is it every delicious.</li><li>I keep going because when I can get the full combo ( chicken, coleslaw, and rice &amp; peas) it is delicious with some `` red sauce'' applied ...</li><li>Their coleslaw is fresh and compliments the sticky rice the chicken comes served on.</li><li>$ 3 chicken is pretty much where it 's at.</li><li>I just close my eyes after I make my order leave my $ 3 on the table and hold my hands out until they hand me my styrofoam container of suspiciously delicious chicken.</li><li>The chicken fell off the bone and was delicious.</li><li>The chicken is decent, and they 're not cheap with what they give you, so I guess it 's worth the money.</li><li>I love their jerk pork and chicken but the staff fits the name of the establishment, jerk.</li><li>A few reasons to love Mr. Jerk- great flavor- great prices ( chicken and pork combo for 10 $ that 's good enough for 2 people)- great sides ( plantains, coleslaw, and chili all mesh well together)- large servings- gravy and rice are awesome I always order take-out and the worst part of the experience is the drive home hungry while the aroma of the grilled chicken fills the car.</li><li>I tried some of the curry chicken and the chicken was so tender and the gravy was thick too.</li><li>The chicken was well seasoned and the veggies were fresh and crunchy.</li><li>The BBQ menu was excellent bbq lamb, chicken and beef.</li><li>The menu consists of shawarmas ( Lamb, chicken, beef), falafel, kebabs ( beef or chicken) in a pita or as a platter with salad, hummus, garlic sauce and rice or fries for the meat options.</li><li>The quality of the meat and chicken can be questionable sometimes tho.</li><li>Armenian kitchen is the best shawarma place in the city because their beef shawarma is very tender and fresh so is the chicken, not fatty at all.</li><li>The chicken was mouth-watering and of decent quality.</li><li>My friend 's shawarma came with large pieces of white meat chicken, the chicken was slightly dry and not crispy on the outside ( as shawarma should be), but it did have a pretty good flavour.</li><li>All the meats, lamb, beef, chicken are very flavourful and tender.</li><li>The chicken was very good, they use breast meat instead of the usual leg meat most shawarma restaurants use.</li><li>The chicken was tender and really soaked up the curry well.</li><li>The chicken was tender but the potatoes were overcooked and mushy.</li><li>The chicken does n't feel like chicken, it is this overly soft meat dish, really kind of gross.</li><li>Chicken tasted weird, I 'd go as far as saying it was the worst chicken I 've ever had.</li><li>Chicken Chow Mein- Noodles and sauce were good, chicken was nasty, Chinese broccoli was huge stalks, very little greens, and was practically raw.</li><li>Lobster, done the traditional way with green onion, Mango chicken and shrimp dish- unique flavour combo- we enjoyed it.</li><li>The vegetables on top were too tough to eat ( clearly very old). when I bit into the chicken, the meat was still pink inside.</li><li>At least I did n't feel the presence of MSG and the chicken was still crispy.</li><li>The chicken was a little mediocre.</li><li>The pork and chicken were good but were cut a bit thicker than normal which made cooking times so long.</li><li>We shared three portions of DakGalBee with noodles, chicken, cheese and kimchi between 4 people.</li><li>Love the chicken and seafood rice cakes with added cheese and ramen.</li><li>Also the chicken was bland.</li><li>I 'm pretty sure it was not marinated, but rather raw chicken cooked first, then sauce added on top.</li><li>We pondered over JS2 and JS3, but looking at the reviews ( they have free wifi!) and how the chicken was so popular, we went with JS2.</li><li>The chicken came fast, but it took a really long time for the cheese and noodles to arrive.</li><li>The waitresses helped mix the chicken with the cheese and noodles, however she had to bring the cooking table away from us as our table was too small.</li><li>The chicken was nothing special, though the cheese did help the 2-portion meal be a bit more filling.</li><li>The chicken and the cabbage though ?</li><li>This option had chicken, mussels, cabbage, squid and shrimp mixed in.</li><li>The $ 9.25 is the basic which includes the chicken, sauce, and some veggies.</li><li>For the Dak Gal Bi, the chicken, cabbage and base are very flavourful.</li><li>The chicken was really juicy and nicely grilled.</li><li>Seemed like the chicken was slowly grilled or was at least marinating in the balsamic because just one bite had a burst of flavour.</li><li>The chicken was seasoned well and paired well with the carbonerra ( bacon).</li><li>The chicken soup/stock has great flavour, It feels homey and I always think this must be so warming and soothing to eat when you are sick.</li><li>The chicken were very crispy and it was very close to how it tastes back in Korea.</li><li>We got a large order of green onion fried chicken ( with bones), and a small order of crispy chicken ( for size comparison) A plate of side-dishes and a hot plate of corn came out as we waited for the chicken.</li><li>The chicken itself had extra batter and was n't drenched over it, which I suppose is what makes it `` more crispy'' than the other offerings.</li><li>I 've only had Korean fried chicken a couple of times so I am in no way an expert, but I was happy with my order and how crispy the chicken was.</li><li>Their chicken was ok- nothing special and not worth the hype.</li><li>The chicken was well cooked, batter was crisp, and it was n't too greasy.</li><li>The chicken is delicious and comes in a cute take out box which include pickled radishes and a drink.</li><li>The chicken is really good, a decent place for friends gathering and casual night out.</li><li>The chicken came hot and quickly, service was great overall.</li><li>Since I did n't order, I do n't know what most of the chicken was called, but none were that special.</li><li>The Fry on the chicken is good and crispy.</li><li>The chicken was ridiculously good and I could eat their garlic butter fries forever!</li><li>They also fry different parts of the chicken, breasts, thighs, wings and cut them up into small pieces so it 's easy to eat.</li><li>Their hot chicken is very spicy and tangy, making it hard to taste the chicken.</li><li>My go to is half crispy chicken ( not the usual classic fried one) &amp; half spicy fried chicken.</li><li>Overall their chicken is crispy and flavoured.</li><li>At least the chicken was pretty good!</li><li>The chicken here is pretty good.</li><li>The overall texure of the chicken was nice, with crispy breading and tender chicken.</li><li>2) Chicken magically both smells &amp; tastes of old fish.</li><li>The chicken was delicious too.</li><li>My table also sampled brownie crepe, chicken, ham, and tropical fruit waffle.</li><li>Seemed more like soggy chicken flavoured tofu.</li><li>The chicken is great, very tender and nicely spiced.</li><li>The chicken is n't the only star in the meal, the rice and coleslaw provides the same amount of attention.</li><li>3) The chicken did n't taste like authentic Jamaican jerk.</li><li>The gravy on the chicken was nice and spicy!</li><li>However the oven taste was very well as the chicken was tender.</li><li>The pho here is average but not fantastic and the rice ( chicken, pork chop, and egg) my boyfriend ordered was decent but his rice was sogging into congee.</li><li>-Omelet w/ham 4/10 tasted microwaved, not many choices for toppings, could n't substitute the bun with something else- Chicken Noodle Soup 7/10 Average, tasted out of a can- Turkey Bacon Wrap 2/10 Horrible, if I was n't as hungry as I was I would of givien it 0/10.</li><li>The chicken, biscuit and fries was fresh.</li><li>The chicken is never fresh.</li><li>Order of two pieces of chicken took 10 minutes and I was next in line.</li><li>I ordered the Mexican Roll ( chicken, green and red peppers) and the Dynamite Roll.</li><li>The chicken in this dish was cubed white meat with no seasoning and utterly flavorless.</li><li>Some faves include the prime rib, crab legs ( cold better than hot), spicy chicken, bbq pork ribs, wings, dimsum, fried fish w Tartar, scallop cutlets, the hot waffles with strawberries and whipped cream, the macaroons, and the creme brulee for dessert.</li><li>I was n't as impressed with the cooked food- kalbi was quite oily and chicken was just okay.</li><li>Customers inconsiderate and rude. the place used to be excellent. i used to come here at least once a week. now the food quality is horrendous. i ordered chicken teriyaki, it smelled like sewage and tasted spoiled. their sushi comes with fish that 's been sitting out for two days. after the last time i ate here i got a stomach ache. i understand trying to save a few bucks, but not at the expense of health!</li><li>I ordered sushi &amp; sashimi bento while my friend ordered chicken teriyaki set.</li><li>When I got home, the chicken was rubbery, the sushi not fresh, only 3 chopsticks when I clearly informed him we were six people, only one small container of soya sauce.</li><li>I usually love their food especially their chicken on the rocks but on my recent visit they gave me really dry chicken and rice.</li><li>Teriyaki shrimp and chicken was excellent.</li><li>It was a special that requires a group of 8, everyone got a few maki/sushi rolls, a bowl of salad, miso soup, fried rice, a shrimp, a scallop, chicken, mixed veggies, salmon and steak.</li><li>We had the chicken, steak and scallop meals.</li><li>Then you pick your meat ( chicken, beef, pulled pork, pulled beef, fish and shrimp) and toppings ( four salsas, cheese, beans, sour cream, lettuce).</li><li>I would recommend the pulled steak ( second would be the pulled pork followed by chicken and shrimp- both chicken and shrimp are a little bland from my experience- I have yet to try the fish).</li><li>I would recommend the pulled steak ( second would be the pulled pork followed by chicken and shrimp- both chicken and shrimp are a little bland from my experience- I have yet to try the fish).</li><li>Also, the General Tso 's chicken was a bit chewy.</li><li>If our order was correct and the chicken was n't chewy, I definitely would have given 5 stars.</li><li>Sandwiches, pizza, made to order, salads, chicken, fish, rice balls, espressos and a full bar.</li><li>The chicken was cooked to perfection and was n't overly spicy but had a nice heat to it.</li><li>As you work your way through the chicken and salad, the rice ends up being coated in a mixer spicy BBQ sauce, garlic sauce and which ever salad dressing you chose ( ranch for me!) leaving a sloppy mess of yumminess at the end.</li><li>I go to their chicken stand and wait there for almost a good minute thinking that the person taking care of the stand is probably just cooking something up but nope no one is there ( nor is there anyone at the sushi stand beside ours) yet there are 5 employees just walking around making jokes with each other.</li><li>As for the food itself ... possibly one of the WORST foods I 've ever had in my life .. the chicken was pretty much ALL just bone chunks and the sauce was soo sticcky from sitting out in the open for so long and I could n't take it ... okay maybe their dessert will be better ?</li><li>I had the Chicken Quesadilla today and that blew my tastebuds off my tongue!</li><li>On the inside, it was filled with a generous amount of chicken and sundried tomatoes.</li><li>I liked how nicely crisp the chicken is for both dishes, but general tao 's is never spicy at any of these places!</li><li>For the chicken, the sauce was really nice, tomatoe-y but not too heavy.</li><li>The piece of chicken was thinly breaded, more meat to breading and the piece of meat was huge.</li><li>Friends tried their chicken, sausage and steak, but I believe veal is the best choice here.</li><li>The bread they used were harder than usual and the chicken were super dry.</li><li>A place like this is the perfect place to come when you want some good chicken.</li><li>I like the seasoning on the chicken.</li><li>The chicken came already cooked with the vegetables and all we did was stir it occasionally for it not to burn.</li><li>The menu says they have chicken, pork or beef bibimbap but that 's a lie.</li><li>I mentioned a couple of times that they never seem to have chicken but never got a straight answer.</li><li>The chicken is perfectly grilled with lots of sauce and is accompanied by delicious roasted potatoes, salad ( I ca n't get enough of this dressing!), their amazing glass noodles, rice and miso soup.</li><li>Had the chicken shawarma box with potato wedges, not bad but the chicken was a little dry.</li><li>The chicken was moist and juicy with a fresh tasting BBQ sauce.</li><li>I ordered a shawarma plate and in my opinion the chicken was dry.</li><li>The chicken was moist and the batter was still crispy when served.</li><li>Excellent quality meat kabobs such as chicken, veal, beef.</li><li>The chicken was nice and juicy.</li><li>Nasi Goreng for $ 7 is my goto lunch dish, which is Malaysian fried rice, chicken, shrimp, tomatoes, onion and a side of peanut sauce.</li><li>Anyway, there are heaps of other Portuguese chicken places that have more delicious chicken and friendlier service.</li><li>Finally I get home and when i opened the container I was disappointed that they gave me rice instead of the vegetables that I had ordered but I soon forgot all about this as i started in on the chicken.</li><li>The chicken was so well seasoned and moist and it had that wonderful BBQ rotisserie char taste by far one of the best Portuguese chickens i have had in a long time.</li><li>Good chicken, it 's always made to order.</li><li>Besides chicken they also offer other Portuguese cuisine.</li><li>One star for the chicken, one star for the hot sauce.</li><li>Found this place very close to my work. superb food and smiling customer service all around. tried their chicken, cod fish and salmon and all of them were just perfect.</li><li>The chicken is some of the best Portuguese chicken I 've had.</li><li>The only problem is that occasionally ( 1 out of 5) the chicken is dry and tastes old.</li><li>1 table long of selection ranging from breaded shrimp, goat curry, noodles, fried rice, chicken wings, sweet and sour chicken, vegetable spring rolls, Bbq chicken and watermelon.</li><li>The chicken was okay but lacked a lot of flavour.</li><li>Steak was OK chicken was white meat and even though advertised as fresh I doubt it was organic as it was bland.</li><li>Usually order the Chicken Pad Thai ( noodles, tofu, chicken, a sprinkling of green onions and a pack of ground peanuts on the side), Spring Rolls ( 2, with sauce) and/or the Ginger Chicken ( stuffed with chicken and different mushrooms, a few red peppers and a flavorful sauce).</li><li>The chicken was very tender, and it was filling.</li><li>My husband and I had ordered chicken and meat loaf on Thursday I think from the dinner for two menu and it was absolutely delicious ... however the regular menu we ordered from at our last visit was very dissapointing!</li><li>This location is not as convenient as their other locations if you are driving but perfect if you are using public transit as it is close to North York Station. stopped in this place for some apps and cake and we ended up with stomach aches. the whole experience was a dissapointment. we had clamari which was rubbery and a small portion. i am a huge calamari fan and this dish was a huge dissapointment. i have had calamari at the brampton symposium many times and loved it everytime. we also had a pita bread pizza type bread with gouda and chicken. the gouda was shredded and sparring. the chicken lacked flavour and fell off the pita with each bite due to lack of cheese to meld it all together. the cheescake was ok. it was extremely soft, nearly a mouse texture and it lacked the delicious graham cracker bottom which is my fav part of cheesecake. the chocolate caramel cake was also a mousse like texture. the caramel was drizzled on top and was eaten in two bites by my 4 year old. the cake lacked any other caramel flavour. it was a large piece and most of it was left behind. i ordered a steamed milk to go with the cake and they forgot to serve it. one star is generous for this place. i would give it a zero if i could.</li><li>I tried their Chicken Parmesan Sandwich with a side of fries.</li><li>Ordered from the date night menu ... not very impressed .. the chicken was very dry had a gross olive paste smothered on it .. the rice was littered with salt and the plate was soaked in soya sauce ..</li><li>Good:- Our server was attentive and pleasant, great job- Salad was reasonably fresh- Fries were pretty good Okay:- Wings were passable, certainly not `` best in the city'' as stated on the menu Bad:- Ribs ... like other reviews noted I 'm pretty sure they 're boiled, not smoked ... perhaps thrown into some sort of smoker briefly after they 're cooked but certainly not smoked over a long period of time, which is disappointing for a place with `` smoke house'' in its name- The chicken was dry and had very little taste, also not at all `` smoked'' like it says on the menu- The `` pulled pork'' was just ... wrong.</li><li>The chicken tastes more or less like what you 'd expect grilled chicken to taste.</li><li>The chicken is the only thing that seems like the right size.</li><li>If you have a groupon and is afraid of shrinkage, get the CHICKEN.</li><li>Beer makes me happy. this was ok --- SUMMARY --- Plus 's: good place to hang out, decent food, Minus 's: sitting on the patio means breathing all the car exhaust from the cars on Yonge street --- MORE DETAILS --- we choose a platter for two ... it consisted of: very tender chicken ( i picked it up and a piece of meat fell off- SO TENDER) first time i had cornbread- it looked burnt on the bottom, so i just ate the top part not bad ( it would n't ' be my first choice) pulled pork was ok chicken wings were fairly good beef brisket was pretty good .. ribs were kinda dry ... in the end everything kinda tasted the same. fries were good- not too salty. stepping in, the restaurant itself is nice, there are booths or table seating indoors. the main window is a garage front that opens into the patio area facing yonge st. interior has exposed beam ceilings and there 's many nostalgic memorabilia decorated throughout. we ordered a couple of things from the menu 1. spaghetti with beef brisket- yeah i know an experimental dish but i was feeling like spaghetti and if the brisket was good -- you know that would been amazing. unfortunately the brisket was covered in tomato sauce so I could n't taste it in it 's full glory or not ..</li><li>Boiled tips were just gross, the brisket was a dry tasteless piece of leather, the chicken was from a steamer type cooker the skin was soft and rubbery, the pulled pork was hands down the worst pulled pork I have ever had!</li><li>But have to say Pearl did a good job in this dish, the chicken was very tender and juicy, not as strong as port but definitely very tasty.</li><li>The chicken is tender and nothing too special.</li><li>The flavor was perfect, and the chicken was cooked perfectly to tenderness.</li><li>The chicken was a bit small but the rest of the ingredients meshed together still made for a pretty good sandwich.</li><li>The chicken was good quality especially for a restaurant of 1.5 star calibre as it says on Yelp.</li><li>For a club it was more than I expected from a diner because the chicken was actual chicken breast and not deli meat.</li><li>The chicken, although it did come grilled, still had a different texture than I 'm used to but the flavour was definitely there.</li><li>They have lamb, chicken, pork &amp; beef.</li><li>Shrimp, chicken, beef, tofu, you name it- they can grill it.</li><li>The meal included the Super Bowl congee, half crispy chicken, chinese donut in noodle roll, deep fried shrimp dumpling!</li><li>Not a fan but there were tons of shrimp, chicken, egg and tofu in it and I mean, tons of shrimp.</li><li>The chicken Marsala was good, but the chicken could have been pounded.</li><li>Only exception would be the actual chicken was a little bit dry, but the sauce was amazing especially with the Garlic Nan.</li><li>The Chicken was dry, and I could n't really taste the curry in the sauce.</li><li>The flaky sauce paired fine with my rice, but the dry chicken was what ruined it.</li><li>The tandoori chicken was flavorful and not too dry.</li><li>The Chicken was flavourless and the sauce tasted like something I could buy in a bottle in a grocery store.</li><li>I am impressed with everything they have, the rice, thin slices of potatoes, the chicken, but most of all the lamb.</li><li>The flavour on the chicken is amazing, moist and grilled to a perfection.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
