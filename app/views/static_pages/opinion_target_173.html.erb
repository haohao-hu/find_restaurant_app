<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 173' %><h2>naan<br />occurrence: 29</h2><div><ol><li>Every other day, for nearly 6 years, I walked by Cuisine of India and never really paid it much attention until people who lived no where nearby started recommending it. then i began to notice that lux cars were always parked there; it 's one of the only places around this subway travellers ' strip with a parking lot in front of the restaurant. and, as far as I can tell, it 's free to park. but certainly there 's more than the parking that caused these commuters from other parts of the city to rave about Cuisine of India. driving is one thing, but in this weather, i wondered,' is it worth walking ? ' so, i rallied my girlfriends living nearby to see just why commuters from other parts of the city were flocking. we got the impression that few local residents ever visited, since the host quizically looked at us ( the group of asian girls) when we entered and waited to be seated. after establishing that, indeed, we were there to eat, yes, food from Cuisine of India, the service was attentive, patient, and warm. the a la carte portions at Cuisine of India are small, and yet incredibly rich. so you can sample a few and be full, without getting a food baby. unfortunately, i do n't remember the names of the dishes we tried, but i recall that the curried cauliflower dish was very well-spiced, without being spicy. the naan are excellent, as are the spicy cracker-like flatbreads. the latter are served while you wait for your meal and the heat really does hit after a few nibbles, so pace yourself as you wait for your meal.</li><li>I had a garlic naan bread ( best naan i 've ever had) and we ordered some pappadoms with mango chutney to start.</li><li>2/5, because the food is n't bad, and the naan are great.</li><li>Anyway, we ordered 4 kebabs, lamb karahi, beef nihari and 4 naan.</li><li>I had to get up again and find the server so we can order an extra naan.</li><li>Nice place overall not really a pricey place I ordered the Nihari and one naan.</li><li>Remember Butter Til Naan not the plain naan.</li><li>Naan was also pretty good but the rest of the food just did n't do it for me.</li><li>And trust me, limited naan is a bad bad things for an Indian lunch buffer.</li><li>Usually about 3-4 Vegetarian options in the buffet ( that is besides the deserts, rice, naan and all the other stuff that goes along with most indian food.)</li><li>For a leg piece of tandoori chicken its 11.99 ..... im expecting a lot for that price and didnt get it ... that being said, the naan was very good as was the bathura.</li><li>The naan was indeed very good- perhaps the only fresh item on the buffet ?</li><li>Surprisingly, naan tasted good.</li><li>The business owner, a very nice man who was handling the cash last night, helped clarify the deal for me: $ 7.99 + tax for veggie platter with the choice of 1 naan OR two roti ( to add any meat it 's $ 8.50).</li><li>The naan was big and filling.</li><li>I ordered the lunch special which was chicken, rice, desert, naan and salad.</li><li>The naan was excellent.</li><li>The food- naan is large.</li><li>We got something similar to a tortilla chip with some veggies in a spicy sauce to dip. ( Not sure what it is called but it was good) I plan on going again to try their lunch buffet! we ordered dinner for two when we stopped by. had bad experience with other buffet style indian food in the past- everything seems a lot more watered down. some of the stuff was good in the pre-fixe menu, some are kinda weird. i liked the tandori chicken and the lamb stew thing. grilled shrimp was mediocre. the long log of some sort of meat was not very good. naan was fresh and crispy so that was a plus. had some leftovers to take home for the next day even. food is alright, not fantastic.</li><li>Rice + Naan- awesome.</li><li>The naan was fresh and not too oily, which I liked.</li><li>Also, nothing comes with rice or naan.</li><li>Besides the naan and shrimp were okay.</li><li>When he asked me if I wanted naan or rice, I asked for naan and then realized I had to pay extra for that.</li><li>The naan was delicious though.</li><li>All of the versions of naan are awesome.</li><li>The cheapest rice was 3 dollars and the naan was 2.50 or so.</li><li>A wonderful meal, the daily special, took us through a wonderful plate of appetizers, a sizzling plate of prawns, butter chicken, aloo gobi, naan and rice, then dessert.</li><li>The Naan is great, so is the butter chicken.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
