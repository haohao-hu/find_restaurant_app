<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 112' %><h2>employees<br />occurrence: 49</h2><div><ol><li>Ice coffe machine always broken, huge lineups all the time, but the employees are always patient and polite, so it makes the overall experience better.</li><li>It 's not ideal to have customer-facing employees who do n't understand the customers.</li><li>Service was fairly good but when we were almost finish eating, all the employees were also eating their lunch and it took some time to get the bill.</li><li>The employees are fairly kind and seem to be trying but management needs to either train them a bit better or hire a few better employees.</li><li>The employees are fairly kind and seem to be trying but management needs to either train them a bit better or hire a few better employees.</li><li>Could not ask for better staff whether it be the employees or management.</li><li>Service is also good and employees are friendly.</li><li>The employees are always super friendly, and have no problem striking up conversation.</li><li>This is a big concern for food stores ... please make sure your employees follow the health rules!</li><li>I frankly enjoy the flavor and how the employees help me, they are very fun!:).</li><li>Owner and employees are very friendly.</li><li>It 's unfortunate for the employees who work there.</li><li>The place is clean, the service is quick and the employees are happy.</li><li>I have had a couple of unprovoked drivethru assaults where the employees have given me stale food or messed up my order.</li><li>Maybe they can get away with it most of the time, but when I can hear the employees relentlessly sharing gossip and using extremely profane language ( often involving mothers and sisters) in Punjabi and Hindi, I instantly forget about my food and regret even stepping foot in the place.</li><li>This one is a hit and miss. One or two of the employees are generally pleasant to customers but a lot of them are apathetic students, quite a few with attitude problems.</li><li>Great location with great employees!</li><li>One of the employees brought his huge cart to collect dishes and was very disruptive.</li><li>The employees were efficient and polite.</li><li>According to one of the employees, the new location no longer sells fresh baked bread loafs.</li><li>The employees are grumpy.</li><li>The service has never been rude, but the employees are often seen bickering with one another.</li><li>My mom noted that it seemed the employees were eager to have us out quickly, but I did n't notice.</li><li>The employees there treat each other like family, which in most cases, translates to good communication and team work with one another.</li><li>I find a number of employees at Chatime in various locations pretty rude to their customers.</li><li>The music was so loud making it easy for the employees to dismiss me.</li><li>I often ask for extra sugar in some drinks and I know certain employees that will honour it while other 's will say `` this drink is not available with extra sugar''.</li><li>It is not professional to yell in front of customers at your employee ( for literally not doing anything) if you 're planning on getting the dynamite roll, do n't bring your girlfriend because the thing is just massive and makes a mess but also amazing The food is amazing but the employees deserve to be treated the way employees are legally treated in Canada, not abused.</li><li>It is not professional to yell in front of customers at your employee ( for literally not doing anything) if you 're planning on getting the dynamite roll, do n't bring your girlfriend because the thing is just massive and makes a mess but also amazing The food is amazing but the employees deserve to be treated the way employees are legally treated in Canada, not abused.</li><li>The employees ' English skills were broken at best, extinct at worst.</li><li>The employees were so nice to assist with parking and also to ensure we had the best quality of food.</li><li>Talking to the employees is like talking to brick wall.</li><li>They were closed and all of the employees were having a smoke break just before they opened the doors.</li><li>Lastly one of the male employees were rude when I went back to ask for more sauce.</li><li>The worst services I have received from Korean restaurants in my life, not because of the employees but the management of the boss.</li><li>Once I saw one of the employees having a loud argument with one of the customers about something, I was sitting far away and could n't really tell what they were arguing about, but in any circumstance I would never yell at any customer if I was the server.</li><li>The minuses can and may or may not be limited to kids running around, which may or may not be to your perference; grouchy-faced employees; not exactly efficient service for your food; I think the BF 's pasta took longer than it should have and it apparently was n't that good.</li><li>The service was certainly lacking; I can understand that it was after 9:00pm on a Wednesday night so they probably do n't expect a lot of customers mid-week but the employees who were working were just disinterested.</li><li>I still ate it however i did add a lot of salt in the soup so that helped somewhat. the service i would give a 2.5/5 because the employees do n't respond to you, even if you wave down a waiter they 'll just ignore you. i did find my bf 's bulgogi dish appetizing, along with the kimchi. although my gom tang was n't as expected, i will probably be back here on a random night craving for some korean food. i am pretty sure there are better dishes they have to offer. pretty convenient that there 's a private parking lot. ( that 's a plus for me bc we hate looking for parking and paying the ticket in general).</li><li>They did this with all employees, so customers beware! portions here are really generous. the workers and waitresses are also really nice. for the people who are complaining about how the workers are ( ie rolliing the dirty dishes around etc) ... thats typically a normal vietnamese resturant for you. if u think this is dirty then u should not go to vietnam lol. but anywho, food here is really good. my parents go here every other day or so cos its close to their work and i also know a friend who eats here everyday too just cause he loves it. the pho, rice, and bun mam is really yummy. also my aunt is obssessed with their viet coffee as she says its authentic since there is so much flavour! also really cheap too:) oh yeah its cash only ... i think by now its safe to say if u go anywhere asian, just have cash with u cos chances are they are not going to take debit or credit!</li><li>The employees work fast and they check your table 's teapot every 5 minutes to see if they have to refill it with hot water.</li><li>The employees work very quickly and efficiently.</li><li>That being said, I am not particularly impressed with the employees lack of urgency.</li><li>On several occasions I have even seen the sandwich preps in the dining area chatting away with other people or employees.</li><li>Neither the burger or the poutine packages felt greasy, so either the bag was just not strong enough or one of the employees put the bag into water/grease/whatever before handing it to me.</li><li>You wo n't have to wait long to be seated and the employees are very friendly.</li><li>The employees seemed very fresh, as the girl struggled to squeeze the whipped cream onto the plate nicely and the male server I had gave my friend and I a strange look when we said we were just there for dessert.</li><li>The employees were Korean, so am I safe to assume this place is Korean owned ?</li><li>My main concern for this place is their lack of employees.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
