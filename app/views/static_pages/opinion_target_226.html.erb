<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 226' %><h2>tip<br />occurrence: 21</h2><div><ol><li>If you do n't earn your tip, you do n't get a tip.</li><li>And I tipped a generous tip even though I did not enjoyed the food much.</li><li>Just for the tip, Hamachi was soso, but other sashimies were fresh and delicious.</li><li>Luckily the tip was n't a lot.</li><li>She gave us the bill while we were still eating ( bill for soda and soy milk clearly visible despite not having bought it out until reminded twice), and when we paid she demanded a 20% tip when we 've already given a very UNDESERVING 10%.</li><li>First, the receipt did n't even have the tip added to it.</li><li>Hey, no skin off my back if you want to be sneaky and not get my extra 5% tip.</li><li>With weekend pricing, dinner was $ 27 + tax + tip, which is pricier than my last two places, but is n't the price of everything going up ? ( especially in Canada these days ...)</li><li>You really expect a $ 15 tip on a $ 30 dinner.</li><li>P. S. leave a good tip whenever you 're at a restaurant, especially if you enjoyed your experience!</li><li>With drinks/ tax/ tip, expect it to be about $ 20 per person.</li><li>I gestured to her to tell her that she short-changed me in which she responded very rudely `` 10% tip!''</li><li>My sister told her that it was because the service that we received did not deserve the typical 15% tip, they were lucky that they even got the 10%.</li><li>We had to ask million times for menu, tea, water, bill etc. we were very unhappy about the service and left a small tip.</li><li>A tad bit more of a kick than I thought there would be from the chili flakes on the tip.</li><li>$ 7 bucks with tax and small tip for a medium.</li><li>I 'm going to put the same amount of energy and thought into writing this review as they did preparing my meal.- horrible attitude from the staff team, not a single trace of politeness ( slams menu on the table, rude comments and demeanor, etc)- dish came in a dirty bowl- was the standard for hygiene this low ? ( See picture below)- dish had a distinct taste of cigarette ash- I paid in cash and before I was able to collect my change, the waitress tried to take the money away and asked ( still rudely) if I was going to leave her a 40% tip.</li><li>Price wise, I paid 46 dollars for all our meals and that is with the tip, so the prices are decent.</li><li>Bad food, expensive ( much of our $ 55 bbq kalbi was bone and sinew), and mandatory tip for extremely bad service.</li><li>Next thing, I see he is complaining that the tip is very low and that it should be at least 10% .... which is redicilous ....</li><li>Maybe they did n't care especially since they knew they were getting an automatic 15% tip.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
