<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 3036' %><h2>tuna nigiris<br />occurrence: 1</h2><div><ol><li>One time they forgot the water and I had to ask someone else so that 's why I give it 4/5 but other than that good place! we stopped by for lunch today. the decor looked fancy, i like the environment. the price tag is a bit on the expensive side. you 're looking at 20-30 dollars easy per person. i do like their quality of food. we had some salmon and tuna nigiris and they were pretty fresh! the staff there are attentive. cute place! although this place was suggested by my cousin ( because his friend owns the place), i was unimpressed by their sushi/sashimi. it was n't fresh! yes, the place is nice, trendy and huge, but i would n't go here for their sushi.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
