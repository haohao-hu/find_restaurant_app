<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 276' %><h2>layout<br />occurrence: 20</h2><div><ol><li>The layout is alright, nothing too fancy like the other sushi restaurants.</li><li>The food selection late at night is decent though and they are open 24/7, so I 'll give them that. as other people have said, the drive thru for this location is amazingly quick. trying to park in the parking lot, to go in for a `` bigger'' then normal order is very painful, the layout with the gas station means you have to up your guard when you 're slowly trying to find a parking spot, cause people are whipping in and out without any discretion whatsoever.</li><li>This place is big, has a cool mixed bar/sushi/asian layout with a buck of communal bat height tables, is hip but not overwhelmingly hipster ( or whatever the Canadian equivalent is), has very bright, sweet, professional servers and an authentic feel and vibe.</li><li>Terrible layout first of all.</li><li>My parents had taken some friends out there for dinner and was appalled by the service and the layout of the tables.</li><li>Dim lights, good layout, feels like your family dining table.</li><li>BUT it is the best place I 've been to and here 's why: Set up: very spacious location with a nice layout.</li><li>And I usually like to see through the sushi bar to watch how they make all kinds of sushi but the layout of this restaurant limits you doing that.</li><li>The layout of this restaurant looks like your typical traditional Korean restaurant overseas ...</li><li>The layout of the place was nice but when it 's that cold it 's hard to enjoy it.</li><li>The layout of confusing.</li><li>The layout of this place is typical with a bunch of tables and booths, but they also have private dining rooms downstairs that 'll seat large groups of people.</li><li>Armando 's has basically kept the same layout as Tony 's, it 's just a little sleekier.</li><li>Ample seating very simple and straightforward layout of the place making everything easy to find.</li><li>I like the layout and the cafeteria style- you go to stations, order your food, and bring it back to your table.</li><li>You can tell from the ceilings and the layout.</li><li>The restaurant itself has a great layout including some private booths on one side and open tables on the other.</li><li>The layout is pretty tight, with a small path from the entrance leading up to the counter, and another path circling around the right.</li><li>First impressions were positive: nice layout and decor, slightly more intimate-feeling booth options, clean washrooms, and music at a reasonable volume.</li><li>The restaurant is quite big, but the split-level layout usually puts enough distance and separation between your table and the others so that a private/ intimate dining experience is possible if desired.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
