<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 19' %><h2>servers<br />occurrence: 354</h2><div><ol><li>The servers are quick to greet, take drinks orders, provide extra napkins, take away dishes and etc.</li><li>The servers were quite nice and attentive. there is nothing really wrong w this place and for the area, it serves it 's purpose but I think I would head up to hwy 7 dessert places for the extra 10 min drive.</li><li>Ps, I found the servers here to be extremely rude .... `` Is that all your leaving for tip ?!?!''</li><li>I hate their uniforms ( the servers look like their ready to go to bed in their pyjamas), but the service provided by the servers is quick.</li><li>I hate their uniforms ( the servers look like their ready to go to bed in their pyjamas), but the service provided by the servers is quick.</li><li>Also, the servers were very friendly and always ready to refill the water.</li><li>The place has about 2 or 3 servers who work on rotation.</li><li>BAD BAD BAD EXPERIENCE Services, food, and servers are WORSTEST ever I have seen.</li><li>They literally have two photocopied menus for us to read, and the servers insisted on getting it back once we were done, kind of strange.</li><li>The servers barely pay attention to you and are rude as well ( I guess the manager 's behaviour has rubbed off on them or she hires people like her).</li><li>Within the span of 5minutes, my colleague and I were surrounded by three very confrontational and hostile servers who began to spew accusations and engage in a highly condescending and abusive tone of voice.</li><li>The servers claimed that the first order of wings ( 2lbs) were in a ' very large circular tray' and the second ( 1lb) order was in a smaller oval tray.</li><li>Eventually one of the servers who had ' attitude' yelled, `` Im very busy and I dont have time to argue over $ 6, next time, when you eat 3lbs of wings you should pay for your 3lbs of wings''.</li><li>Food tasted good, servers were friendly and came often enough to check up on our group as well as refill water.</li><li>The atmosphere is really nice, the servers really attentive.</li><li>All the servers and store manager try their best to accommodate you.</li><li>Super nice Waitress 3.5 stars ... decent food ... nice servers with short skirts LOL Best sushi restaurant in the GTA.</li><li>If you come here, you 'll receive IMPECCABLE service not only from the servers but the management as well.</li><li>This place is big, has a cool mixed bar/sushi/asian layout with a buck of communal bat height tables, is hip but not overwhelmingly hipster ( or whatever the Canadian equivalent is), has very bright, sweet, professional servers and an authentic feel and vibe.</li><li>The servers are nice and friendly, they strive to be good, but can forget some things here and there.</li><li>The restaurant seemed understaffed and the servers looked a little disoriented.</li><li>Woah I 'm stuffed. the manager and servers are very friendly and attentive. we tried toro ( bluefin tuna) sashimi, and it tasted so good. it 's just very pricey ( $ 19.95, usually $ 24.95). i ordered chirasu lunch ( rice with various kinds of sashimi) as main course and all the sashimi were very fresh and well served. would definitely go back there again to try their sushi combo.</li><li>The servers are also great for suggestions if you do n't know what to order ..</li><li>The female servers are so hot!</li><li>Young attractive servers and seasoned veterans service the hip and happening crew right up the the biz peeps and family diners.</li><li>The atmosphere was awesome and the servers were great.</li><li>Although some of the servers are not fluent in English, they still try their best to accomodate you.</li><li>Service was really good- servers always made sure our tea cups were n't empty.</li><li>They even feature cute looking waitresses in black skirts and tight dresses, which seem to be a common theme at Asian-inspired restaurants in the area! ( Nome Izakaya, Moxies `` feature'' similar wardrobe for their servers too.)</li><li>The servers were nice.</li><li>More often than not when you look around, there are no servers.</li><li>I usually find complaints towards general service inadequacies to be petty attempts at a more sophisticated restaurant review, but it literally took me more than 4 requests to two different servers including my own to have my water filled just once, and the overabundance of sodium in the dishes did n't help much either.</li><li>All the servers are friendly and never make you feel rushed in anyway.</li><li>The servers take time to list off the side dishes provided and to explain how to eat each entree.</li><li>One of the servers came by to check if we wanted a refill of banchan ( YES PLEASE!).</li><li>The servers were very gracious and polite.</li><li>Service was excellent, very attentive and friendly servers!</li><li>Service: I found most of the servers were here on a working visa ( overheard from an over friendly customer who was chatting with them).</li><li>The servers are so kind.^^ We ordered the ginseng chicken soup, the spicy pork hot stone bowl and the beef bulgolgi hot stone bowl which came with soup and rice.</li><li>Nothing flashy whatsoever, but clean, and the servers are all kind.</li><li>No sullen teen servers here!</li><li>The servers are pleasant and helpful.</li><li>My group of friends and I come here so often that the servers already have the biggest smiles on their faces when they see us.</li><li>We were quickly seated by who I think was one of the owner and I remember other yelpers mentioned that the owner and servers were quite rude.</li><li>However, I find the waitresses/ servers are not friendly.</li><li>Most of the servers always had a coffee pot in hand, ready to refill any coffee.</li><li>The servers are super friendly and the food came fast.</li><li>The last time we visited, we waited for almost an hour for our food and we were n't given much attention to by the servers.</li><li>Hard to get the servers ' attention and they were not attentive.</li><li>Most of the servers are Asian too which led me to believe that this was a hot spot for us.</li><li>The servers need to be properly trained.</li><li>The servers got the 1 out of 2 orders wrong.</li><li>Service is non- existent- too much attitude from the servers.</li><li>Felt bad for the servers having to deal with so many unhappy customers but unfortunately, it appeared they were too busy and were getting orders wrong.</li><li>The servers cannot speak proper English and not all dishes have proper description or pictures.</li><li>Also, it took us for more than 15 minutes to wait for someone to come and take our order, servers were not very helpful.</li><li>The servers are super nice too.</li><li>The servers are all very nice, older gentlemen.</li><li>The owner personally came to check on us, and the servers were friendly and attentive.</li><li>I have never been to Japan so this is probably not what it looks like at all, but this restaurant embodies what I, as an American, think it looks like: Bamboo colored wood, those paper window doors, paper lanterns, coi fish, etc., the servers even wore cute kimono inspired outfits.</li><li>My mind is n't totally made up about the service as one of the servers was great and the other was a bit of a tool.</li><li>The servers are not attentive and rude.</li><li>Service: The servers are very friendly, lots of smiles and soft spoken.</li><li>The servers were friendly, we got our food pretty quickly.</li><li>The servers even walked over a few extra pieces of lamb to the table because they were feeling generous.</li><li>And that 's because no one of the servers was at the door and available to seat us.</li><li>The servers were fantastic, excellent customer service.</li><li>The servers are n't rude- they are trying, but it 's almost like this location only hired servers who flunked their Smart Serve.</li><li>The servers are n't rude- they are trying, but it 's almost like this location only hired servers who flunked their Smart Serve.</li><li>Had the following Calamari- Not too greasy, could be a bit crispier but thoroughly enjoyed it with the Cajun dip Tortilla and Dip- Tasty and refills of tortillas was offered by our server Ribs with Fries n Beans- Ribs were prepared quite good, fall off the bone, not too fatty, not too much muscle fibers, sauce was good, fries were crispy, bans were not mush, definitely recommended NY and Top Sirloin Steak was cooked proper to medium rare, for the price it had a decent depth of flavor, salad that came with it was pretty standard, veggies were cooked well, mashed potatoes was good, first time having the Peppercorn sauce not taste like burnt chocolate, bravo to the new kitchen staff Probably will come back but I 'll probably request Miranda as my server as there 's been too many servers that take their job for granted at this location.*** note they do n't validate parking anymore 2apps 3 entrees Above average gratuity Around $ 150 for 3 happy and full people Will come back to this location if I 'm having a craving for tender ribs Really nicely designed.</li><li>Our servers were Patrick and Rachel and they took good care of us.</li><li>You are going to pay a little more here, yes, I admit, but it 's so worth it ... the service is fantastic, the warm lighting and warm inviting servers who are eager to take your order and check up on you often is a real treat.</li><li>The servers were friendly, smiling and served us right away after we walked in.</li><li>I was paying with Debit and I like to leave the tip in cash for servers, maybe I am wrong and this is not more convenient for them, but that 's the misconception I labour under.</li><li>Service 4.0/5- The staff is very friendly here all the way down from the chef to the hostess to the servers.</li><li>With a line forming at the takeout/pick up counter the servers stationed there would just keep looking at your receipt to see what you have but would not do anything to expedite the order.</li><li>I found this slightly odd because I 'm used to there being servers at the other location.</li><li>I 'm really beginning to lose my patience with the lazy servers of Toronto.</li><li>The servers are really nice and friendly.</li><li>The service is quick, but unfriendly- the feeling is the the servers would rather be some place else on that day.</li><li>The servers seemed to be a bit flustered and disorganized.</li><li>However, as the early diners vacated their tables, the service improved and the servers were friendlier towards the end of our night.</li><li>I understand that servers look at us and judge because of our young age but it does n't mean we do n't have money.</li><li>There are a lot of people in the restaurants ( cooks, servers, the boss that likes to sit in the front with his friends) and makes the restaurant feel a little cramped.</li><li>SERVERS The servers were quick as usual.</li><li>The servers are friendly, just flag them down.</li><li>To ensure that each item is cooked correctly, the servers seem to like having full control of the entire cooking process.</li><li>I enjoyed the steam egg and their beef ribs are quite good, however, we had to eat through conversations between the servers in Mandarin about how this one table is still ordering and complained about them openly.</li><li>Fast and efficient service and pleasant servers.</li><li>The servers also do not forget anything.</li><li>Overall experience, the food came out pretty quickly and servers were nice.</li><li>Despite the busyness, most servers were not rude or impatient.</li><li>It was a full house but the servers were not attentive.</li><li>The servers are very nice by comparison to most AYCE restaurants.</li><li>I originally tried the restaurant because I knew the managing partner ( she had managed my local sushi hangout) and I was also aware that I knew some of the servers who were working there.</li><li>Anyways i had a great experience and i will be coming back another time. food is great servers are not. although our dishes were constantly brought out and picked up promptly the servers would throw dishes on to the table and even the bill as if they are giving food to dogs ... the food was delicious but too bad the waitresses had to ruin the experience I come here quite a bit and it never disappoints.</li><li>Anyways i had a great experience and i will be coming

definitely work hard to clear your table as soon as your finished with a plate.</li><li>When the servers come to clean up your plans they always say excuse me ..</li><li>I have to say, the speed of service, the accuracy of food order and the quality of food is amazing. even the servers are all pretty nice as well. empty dishes/plates do n't last very long on table. as soon as i finish swallowing the food, it does not take more than 45 seconds and the empty plates are gone! 2 minor issues with Sushi Legend.</li><li>The service here sucks big time UNLESS you get the lady manager or the guy manager they are both very polite and very caring about the customer service but the actual servers do n't care at all.</li><li>The servers are very friendly!</li><li>First time here, order the dinner sets.The servers are really friendly but they are crazy busy so be patient with them.</li><li>Constructive criticism: for the servers to have more knowledge on their items they serve.</li><li>( Had an issue the first time I went) The servers are very nice I feel like she knows the boyfriend and I by face.</li><li>At no point did the servers ever come to ask how our meal was, to refill our water, to refill our bread or simply to check in.</li><li>Good for peanut allergies as both my kids have it but have to inform the servers.</li><li>There are a few of the servers who I really like and some are just meh.</li><li>Some of the servers are extremely rude and just stare at you blankly when you make a request for something.</li><li>Usually when you go to a Chinese restaurant you find semi-rude to rude servers trying to get you in and out quickly.</li><li>Service is good too, the servers speak English ( not very fluently but good enough) without making you feel weird if you do n't speak Chinese.</li><li>And please do not get me wrong, I extend the utmost respect and patience with servers.</li><li>There are always plenty of seats available and the servers will get your started quickly.</li><li>The servers did n't know the menu enough to answer questions as to the differences of the dishes and when the food arrived i was floored.</li><li>The waitress was friendly and even humoured my friend when he made a lame joke about working there since he wore a shirt that matched the orange of the servers '.</li><li>Do n't even know if we could go on our road trip today just because of this meal. visited on tuesday night around 7pm for dinner. the place was packed and noisy. there were only 2 servers + owner lady ? so the service was very slow ( especially they have to cook the food for u at the table). they were so busy and my order was confused but she apologized politely right away so we just ate our meal w/out complain. but i still prefer the downtown location. their food &amp; service is better. and its really hot in the inner part of the restaurant.</li><li>The servers were all cantonese speaking.</li><li>Service is good as servers are friendly and foods come out quick.</li><li>Rude and disrespectful servers that talk back to you.</li><li>The servers were very friendly and the restaurant is very cute and clean.</li><li>I like how welcoming the servers are.</li><li>I find the servers speak really fast.</li><li>When it come to italian food i expect using lots of fresh ingrediants specially hand roll pastas but when i get dry one i 'm not happy, the portions are so bigand the price is good for the quality, i tried the meat lasagna which comes with ricotta cheese instead of bechamel sauce and all the foods were bland: ( The servers wasnt around when you needed them I have attended this restaurant with my boyfriend a number of times and have always left satisfied.</li><li>I was there last night for dinner and one of the servers had long blonde hair and did not have it tied back, she was serving food to customers with one hand while flipping her long hair all over the place with the other hand, it was disgusting to watch and had she been serving food to my table I would have refused it.</li><li>The other two female servers did have their long hair tied back.</li><li>The servers were very attractive and polite and it is a wonderful dining environment.</li><li>They also have really neat booths where the tables are very private and there 's a button to call the servers.</li><li>The servers respond.</li><li>The servers are mindful to bring these out quickly.</li><li>Not to mention, the servers were RUDE like no other ( maybe cause we only spoke English).</li><li>The restaurant was busy and there were only 2 servers.</li><li>It 's a nice place for a date ( very quiet and the servers will leave you alone unless you call for them), with a bunch of tables and about 4 or 5 booths.</li><li>The service was very slow, they were down servers.</li><li>My friend and i enjoyed our first experience here. the panang curry was amazing. the flavour and spice was delicious. i got the tofu paneng and she got the beef. the service was extremely friendly at the bar as well as the other servers were very bice too. staff was attentive and courteous and i personally enjoyed the atnsoohere. the lights were too dark, and the decor was appropriate. happy to have had my first experience here be a good one.</li><li>SERVICE- attentive servers, and Linda came by twice to check up on us and chat you up, which I thought was great!</li><li>When our group of 8 steadily grew by ones and twos into 14, the servers kept their humour and found us an extra table and squeezed more chairs into our cozy alcove.</li><li>We went there for a friend 's birthday just a few weeks ago and we thought this was a really great thai restaurant. servers were nice and we believe we met the owners of the restaurants that came to chat with us about the dishes as it came out.</li><li>No one in the restaurant will understand you as all servers seem to be Chinese and do not understand Vietnamese.</li><li>But it was just shocking as I have never been to a Vietnamese restaurant in the GTA where the servers could n't understand Vietnamese.</li><li>The services was slightly below average, because we had to walk over our empty teapots to servers for water refills.</li><li>Very good food and service here: the servers were All very attentive and helpful with recommending various choices on the menu.</li><li>The servers are friendly and efficient and we had no issues with the service we received.</li><li>Service was fast and servers were nice.</li><li>Service was lacking, as the servers kept missing some of our items, and they were n't as attentive to us ( maybe because we were such a large table ... but still!).</li><li>Service was excellent and servers are very friendly.</li><li>The place was very clean and the servers were nice.</li><li>Unless they were bringing food to us, the servers were never in the back room.</li><li>Also the servers are very nice and the food comes fast.</li><li>Understandable considering the ethnic/cultural background but lack of attention from the servers where managers had to step in to address our issues couple of times for not being attended to for far too long.</li><li>Tons of screen, dark wood, quite a bit of seating, comely servers.</li><li>I know seafood is expensive, but for the high price I 'm paying and the small portion I get, I expect some kind of uniqueness and exceptional quality in the food and good service from the servers.</li><li>Some of the servers do n't speak a lick of English though so you do need to be patient.</li><li>Food: is good, amazing for the price you 're paying Service: servers are not all about small talk- they are fast and always in a rush- which is fair, it is a busy restaurant.</li><li>But the servers here are n't rude like at many other Chinese restaurants.</li><li>Finally, my brother had to go up to one of the servers ( the restaurant was empty and there were at least 5 of them just standing around) and ask them for the bill so we could leave.</li><li>A ton of servers means quick service.</li><li>The servers are n't rude, they are polite but do n't give a fuck.</li><li>Several servers paused at the table to make sure we could handle the lobster congee LOL after we looked at it and asked how to eat it.</li><li>The servers are friendly and drinks taste great.</li><li>The place is very small to begin with and only 2 servers working.</li><li>The servers were nice but as it got busier, service became poor and slow.</li><li>Our experience with the servers has been positive: they seem nice and speak English.</li><li>In addition to the lack of lighting in this North York location, the servers here are n't too friendly either.</li><li>I was n't even rude when I was asking about it, but the servers responded it a very rude manner.</li><li>The servers were very nice, and did n't seem to mind that we lingered for an hour after our meal, chatting away.</li><li>I just fear for the servers ' safety when they cook the noodles since the equipment they use to cook the dishes look a bit archaic. i used to go to the one in downtown and this time i thought i will give their yonge location a try !! ordered the chicken dakgalbee with their original joons sauce. and always its a must to add on cheese, ramen and ricecake !!! ( MY FAVVVV !!!) it was a little different as the dakgalbee was now cooked by a staff and brought to you instead of it being cooked right in front of you !! ( there was a little area on one side of the restaurant where a staff is cooking all the dakgalbee orders). i didnt like that as i enjoyed taking part in the cooking process and watching it cooked right in front of me !! the portions did seem smaller and the ramen ended up being overcooked. everything else was ok. maybe its just me but i find the downtown location tasted better!</li><li>The servers were pleasant but service in general was a little slow.</li><li>The two main servers speak fluent English.</li><li>I usually speak Mandarin to the servers as I find it 's easier to communicate.</li><li>Service: Each time I 've been it 's super hectic and the servers always seems overworked.</li><li>Service is horrible, for get about servers handing you menus; they are tosses on the the table.</li><li>There are only 1 or 2 ( when it 's the busier dining hours) servers who must host, take orders for both dine-in and take out, and deliver orders.</li><li>So I ordered it in Mandarin because after reading reviews, it seems like the servers know basic English.</li><li>You can even bring the bubble tea and drink it in artisan noodle, they do n't have much choices for drinks there and servers do n't mind you bringing drinks from outside.</li><li>( Also, speaking Mandarin would potentially help when ordering, but the servers speak English so do n't be scared to try here if you do n't speak Mandarin.)</li><li>However what can not be forgiven is the negligence of servers in forgetting to punch in your order.</li><li>The servers do their job and are polite.</li><li>The service was also unimpressive, the servers never came by to fill up water or ask if everything was alright.</li><li>I think there could be better ways to streamline the duties and processes here to allow the servers to more efficiently serve the customers.</li><li>I think he could have helped out with some of the duties when he saw the servers are overwhelmed.</li><li>Hoping it would be a special dinner, but as soon as we were seated, no servers came to us for about 15 mins and the restaurant was n't even busy.</li><li>I gave them 3 stars because the servers were nice and work hard, and I enjoyed watching the duck carved at the table.</li><li>The servers were very difficult to get hold of.</li><li>Restaurant is the type where you order from the counter from a menu on a board and then sit down with a number on a stick to indicate where the servers should deliver your food.</li><li>The number is brought to the table and the servers will bring you the food.</li><li>I do n't know about the other reviewers on here but we got friendly servers and they offer excellent recommendations since we are new to this bistro.</li><li>Also, typical servers check the food with a ' two-bite rule' however this system places the responsibility on the consumer.</li><li>Their Italian sodas are amazing, for 3-4 $ They have servers, but they go by pay first option.</li><li>Scowling or unfriendly servers.</li><li>Also some servers speak mandarin!</li><li>The servers actually serving us were kind and made sure we got all of our banchan and were observant, they would refill them for us without us needing to ask.</li><li>There was no separation of the tips either to provide indication that the tips actually goes towards the servers, so I decided not to tip.</li><li>Yes, the servers are nice, but the owner is a person of poor character and the food frankly, is not all that delicious and not worth it.</li><li>Verdict: great food, LOTS of side dishes, reasonably priced, servers were nice I went at kind of an awkward time of day so it was pretty quiet.</li><li>Also just from observations, one of the servers did n't seem to be too great with communicating in English with a different table for some special requests, but another server came by quickly and smoothed things out.</li><li>There are a few `` bad'' servers, but most of them are awesome.</li><li>Service is fine and the servers are nice.</li><li>It can get crowded, but service is usually quick and servers are attentive, as long as you flag them down.</li><li>It has two distinguishing factors aside from the mystifying name which most people can not pronounce properly: 1) A lot of the servers can speak Koreand and Mandarin, eliminating some language barrier to a significant portion of the customer base.</li><li>They were still kind, but I wish they would look around and spot opportunities to serve the customers more often ( many people trying to flag the servers had their hands in the air for a minute or two).</li><li>These newbie ( ish) servers do n't really know what they are doing so their system is very disorganized and lack in staff does n't help the situation as well.</li><li>Another down side is that the servers here are always friendly but unfortunately they are not fluent in English.</li><li>The servers try their best to accommodate although it was fairly packed with many people waiting to get a seat.</li><li>Service- When we arrived, no one came to greet us instead 4 servers were just hanging out behind the counter and yelled out sit wherever and when we choose our spot they said `` not there'' ( because we needed to be at least 3 persons) and then my friend pointed out a group of 2 who were sitting at a 3-4 person table and her excuse was to blubber no and forced us to sit in between two busy ( and might I add super tight) tables.</li><li>Overall this was a fun dessert place with friendly servers and a nice, light atmosphere.</li><li>Service was meh, there were a few times when we saw the servers chatting, and it was only when I raised my hand that our server came over to us.</li><li>Brownie points go to the servers- who are very friendly and accommodating.</li><li>The fresh and bright atmosphere welcomes you to cheery servers and delicious food:) Pastel has many desserts, including ( if I am not mistaken) Peruvian chocolate mousse.</li><li>I sit here for a few hours with friends sometimes, and the servers are attentive.</li><li>The servers also make the desserts themselves.</li><li>Service is as expected for an asian place, not very personal, the servers are just focused on bringing you your food and then you eat and you 're out.</li><li>Just plain mean servers.</li><li>It was so cheerful and sweet when all the servers sang for the birthday gal ( sign up for the mailing list online and you get a free dessert for your birthday!)</li><li>We started eating and the servers just keep bringing more food as we ate.</li><li>The servers are very attentive and friendly ( + 1 for speaking fluent Cantonese and English!).</li><li>Cons:- though the servers are very friendly, service can sometimes be slow if they forget to come back to check on you.</li><li>I have visited Ichiban on 2 occasions, both times I got my sushi to go so I cannot comment on the servers.</li><li>Maybe 6 or 7 table seAted and there were 3 servers.</li><li>Cons:- The servers are sometimes absent minded.</li><li>The owner is pretty savage guy and servers, sushi bar chefs all very rude and pretty shitty overall.</li><li>Some days are better than other for consistency of dishes, but the servers are cheerful and do want to make you a welcome guest.</li><li>On another occasion I recall my servers secretly including a $ 15 `` service fee'' on every one of my friend 's bills ( we paid separately), none of us noticed and included a tip in the cost.</li><li>In a strip mall, directly across from the Dufferin exit of Orfus, Yuki definitely does n't look special from the outside, but the inside has little private booths, adequate seating, hot tea and friendly servers.</li><li>The staff have been there since for years the service is good they do their very best to make sure that you have a good experience, since its so busy you may have to grab the servers attention.</li><li>--- SUMMARY --- Plus 's- unintrusive servers who know when you need them ( ours was, anyway) and really good chicken wings ( even the left overs) Minus 's- ribs --- MORE DETAILS --- Came here for a beer and chicken wings after some rock climbing.</li><li>Even though there were couple of servers, only one of them seemed to be effective and she was covering most of the tables to tend the guests.</li><li>They serve only standard coffee/decaf from a depressing central bar area ( with a several generation-old green iPod dangling vicariously from a similar circa amp) ... a nice Italian espresso/latte machine .... and a dedicated barista ... would go a long way ... not to mention, obviate the need for the long-suffering, overrun servers ... having to make drinks/coffees ... in addition to serving, busing, cleaning, etc.</li><li>The servers were terrific.</li><li>The atmosphere in terms of decor and noise level like being at a mcdonalds but with sushi and servers.</li><li>The servers were alright, nothing to scream about.</li><li>The servers were very patient and friendly with us as we probed on the 9-item menu ( amateurs we are! ... well more her than me ... but still).</li><li>There 's less complimentary apps served here compared to places like Nak Won, though the servers are pretty quick to refill them when finished.</li><li>The service is fast and the guy servers are always flying around table to table.</li><li>The thing I love most about this place is how nice and helpful the servers are.</li><li>SERVICE The servers spoke english which made ordering a breeze.</li><li>The servers all tend to be Korean males, mainly due to the need to carry out the hot rice plates ( or so I 'd like to believe!)- happened to be low on energy ( mobile phone) and they kindly moved us to a table that had an outlet- superb service!</li><li>Fast service, lots of servers.</li><li>The servers were really nice.</li><li>I guess its cause the place was so busy and the servers were tired out ?</li><li>There is parking at the back of the restaurant and the servers will ask you if you 've parked there because they need to ensure that the spots are taken by customers.</li><li>The servers do n't mind when you ask for more.</li><li>The servers are fast and although many of them do n't speak English well, their effort is apparent and it definitely makes up for it.</li><li>Given the size of our party, we had the foresight to order in advance ( 2-3 hours before our scheduled reservation) ... but were incredibly disappointed that quite a few of the dishes came out of order- and some dishes never came out at all, even after we reminded a number of servers over and over again.</li><li>To their credit, the servers were pleasant and had a good sense of humour but we probably wo n't bother going back.</li><li>I always find the chefs and servers to be very friendly as well.</li><li>The servers, although really do n't have to do much because the chef does everything, needed to come by more frequently to top of our tea cups, water, and other beverages.</li><li>My girlfriend continuously tried to flag servers who would n't come to our table, then one who appeared to be a manager still with no response.</li><li>All servers were very nice.</li><li>On the bright side, the servers are still as sweet &amp; lovely as ever ...</li><li>Some of the cold foods in the counter were pilled onto each other, servers were using the same gloves hand to touch multiple food items ( there was beet juice on the cantaloupe) and the kitchen space seemed a bit dingy.</li><li>May be they are servers as well as Cook.</li><li>The servers clearing the tables were mostly cheery and efficient, but I feel overall that the service used to be better.</li><li>I think our servers could have come to our table a little more often.</li><li>She acknowledged that and continued to say that none of the servers nor the manager could do anything about it.</li><li>I was infuriated after hearing that because this whole time we had been dealing with servers and the only manager around was one that could not communicate with us.</li><li>The best part is the bar area with the large screens and plenty of servers there to provide you with adult beverages.</li><li>The service is fast, even if the servers seem like they have not slept in a few days.</li><li>Owl is always busy, and it seems like there is n't enough servers despite how busy the place is.</li><li>At first the servers came immediately when we pressed the button but as things got crazy it understandably took a while longer.</li><li>Their service is 3/5, but all the boys servers are extremely polite.</li><li>The servers kept asking us what my boyfriend wanted her to do about it even though he clearly stated he lost his appetite.</li><li>I told one of the servers about my experience with the meal and he obnoxiously, rudely and un hesitantly said I ca n't order something on the menu and say you dont like it ..</li><li>They are very friendly and there are little buttons on the side in which you can press and servers come ( fantastic system should be like this everywhere).</li><li>The servers do not get to keep any tips at all.</li><li>Took a while to get the servers attention when we wanted to get a refill or the bill.</li><li>Often, servers can give attitude and are hard to flag down.</li><li>I also observed servers arguing with each other in the restaurant.</li><li>The servers are so helpful and sweet, and the wings are delicious!</li><li>On the positive side, the Korean BBQ beef coleslaw sandwich and fries were really delicious ... i did n't even need to use their special garlic dill dip but i recommend ordering the dip with your fries to have a fresh change from ketchup sometimes. today 's soup was beef barley which was average as was the double amaretto sour however i was pleased they offered fresh options and could accommodate my off-menu drink request. final tip- do not order the nachos here. they were pretty bad ... happy i can always get great nachos at my joint fox n fiddle finch. hope the manager can fix the crappy service here because I 'd like to come back to watch a game and taste the fajita tacos, fish tacos or one of their tempting burgers. ok last last tip i dont know if i should write this but the servers are pretty so i guess that could be a plus for those who appreciate that sort of thing.</li><li>As you get to know the servers you 'll find them to be fairly patient and hardworking, but they wo n't take any shit or sass from difficult patrons.</li><li>We were seated at the very back with very little view of the restaurant and definitely fewer visits by the servers.</li><li>Also, the servers are great and are always welcoming.</li><li>The servers were very nice, and frequently came by to refill water and see how we were.</li><li>All the servers were really polite and genuinely wanted to help you.</li><li>They have nice clean decor and ( relatively) attractive servers.</li><li>After meeting a former employee I found out that the servers are over worked like horses.</li><li>The few servers are expected to take care of the entire restaurant, expected to actually go behind the bar and make their own drinks and make their own desserts ( because owners do not want to pay a bartender), clean the washrooms in between this, all the while getting yelled at by the owners for not doing this faster.</li><li>Also, I have never seen a restaurant where the servers cannot pour the coffee and have to wait for the bartender to give it to them.</li><li>I come here for the poutine and massive burgers, the servers are very nice and although the parking lot can get pretty hectic ( Metro/Shoppers) its worth it every time.</li><li>The servers are nice.</li><li>The servers here are great and I would definitely recommend to come here!</li><li>Very poor service, and servers were throwing stuff across the tables.</li><li>Also, the servers did n't crack a smile once, which I found kind of off putting.</li><li>It is the service that is the definition of nightmare ... I 'm not even talking about glacial slow service, I 'm talking about rude servers that not will bluntly ignore you or yell at you.</li><li>I ate here and was very disappointed by the level of service and quality of food.* Service* Being Asian, I 'm used to bad service but this Korean place took the icing on the cake for being the most inattentive servers.</li><li>The servers did n't make us feel welcomed, more like rushed.</li><li>Best part is when the servers recognize you and they act so much friendly haha!</li><li>The servers did not smile, say ' you 're welcome' or even acknowledged us when we said thank you.</li><li>This would have been fine because they had a bell we can ring for service, except the servers seems to have a knack for ignoring it.</li><li>Service was super quick even during the busy lunch hours and the servers kindly gave you whatever sauce/dressing you wanted in a little tub.</li><li>The servers are very polite and the food arrives unexpectedly quickly.</li><li>The servers are very friendly and professional.</li><li>The service was perfect; two very professional and friendly servers were assigned to our four tables.</li><li>He is probably one of the best servers I 've had in Toronto.</li><li>I enjoyed Winterlicious lunch with my boyfriend last month and although the food was mostly delicious, I still ca n't get over the fact that the whole meal felt very rushed for a Sunday lunch and the servers seemed overwhelmed with the number of people in their restaurant.</li><li>The servers were really rude in all their action.</li><li>I 'm not sure if the servers are mostly students from the nearby college.</li><li>Some servers are still nice and I do visit here very occasionally but this location ruined the whole Pizza Hut experience for me.</li><li>Most of the servers are under training but very pleasant.</li><li>The servers were attentive and courteous.</li><li>Our bottomless coffee was filled only once when we asked the servers for a refill multiple times and no one showed up.</li><li>But I 'm guessing only because the restaurant was so empty and the servers were bored.</li><li>Busy lunch time crowd but there are many servers to ensure speed and efficiency.</li><li>The place was not too busy so it was a nice dining experience for us with servers ' full attention on us, but I left wondering why was this place not as popular as I expected it would be ?</li><li>The service is quite fast, and the servers are very welcoming and friendly.</li><li>Fresh fish, friendly servers, and awesome atmosphere.</li><li>If you do n't go for the wings however this is a pretty nice sports bar to watch soccer/ hockey games at and the servers are pretty friendly.</li><li>Most of the servers are cute ... but not that I care much.</li><li>The servers there knew we could n't leave them any kind of decent tip so they did n't bother with us, and we did n't bother with them .. at least, I thought it was just because we were young and lacked money that the service was terrible ..</li><li>I 'd rather go down the street to McDee 's and get my free smile than try to pry one from the lips of the servers there.</li><li>The food was bountiful and served up dutifully by the banquet hall servers in a never ending succession of courses.</li><li>Every 20 mins or when the plates were cleared the servers put a new dish on the stand.</li><li>Service was pretty lousy, but I counted 4 servers in a big, busy restaurant, so whatevs.</li><li>The servers took forever to come around to take our order, and only refilled our tea once after waiting half an hour. the person who seemed to be the owner tried clearing the plates off our table, but my friend was n't even finished her food!</li><li>It 's one thing to have bad service, but it 's another when you have to ask 10 times for the servers to bring you the food that you ordered.</li><li>Even though the food is n't bad, the mannerism of the servers and the chaos is very off-putting.</li><li>Also, the service was slow, even though we had four different servers for our table.</li><li>Also, a lot of the servers were sending food to the wrong tables, there seemed to be a general confusion with most of them.</li><li>Overall, the food is okay, the service is slow, the servers are unorganized and the place can get loud and crowded.</li><li>The servers are n't very attentive or dare i say, sloppy at taking orders or just dumping dishes on your tables with a lack of mannerism.</li><li>I will not be returning to this location and I hope the servers are more friendly and not quick to shut you down.</li><li>Stay away from this dirty `` restaurant'' that hire servers with attitude.</li><li>The place is extremely dirty, the food is questionably and definitely microwaved, and the servers did n't have their customer service training.</li><li>Not the servers.</li><li>That 's not the servers fault.</li><li>The servers know their food and are always happy to recommend items on the menu.</li><li>They are very courteous too so we need to ask them to give servers at Canoe a good training.</li><li>The servers also managed to forget the appetizer order for one of our party ... and finally delivered it to him at the same time that they were serving the main courses to the rest of us.</li><li>Sometimes I find the servers tend to forget about checking up on me.</li><li>Service was n't too bad, but they did n't seem to have enough servers working.</li><li>We waited for about 10 mins before trying to get the servers attention.</li><li>Yes, the guys at the grill station are fantastic--very efficient while never undercooking the meat--and the servers are on their game with clearing the tables.</li><li>At 3:00, while we 're still eating, one of the servers comes over, interrupts the conversation and says the restaurant is closing soon, so would we like separate bills or just one ?</li><li>The servers quickly replaced the vegetables and assured us that everything was safe to eat.</li><li>Also, the servers are friendly and very quick to respond to your order.</li><li>The servers were all polite ... but a little slow.</li><li>It was the same thing, only this time the servers and chef all seemed slow and depressed to be there.</li><li>I love how the servers communicate.</li><li>The servers have some secret language that involves loud whispering, it 's intriguing and makes me want to whisper loudly as well, just to fit in ( or throw them off, whichever).</li><li>Every time I eat here, servers are very quick and attentive to you.</li><li>The servers are fast and efficient, though not the most friendly .... but, given the food quality and the pricing, it is well worth it.</li><li>The servers come once in a while and not the friendliest compared to other non chinese restaurants.</li><li>It took several tries to get one of the servers to come take our order and get the bill afterwards.</li><li>Our servers were great and very patient with my group.</li><li>In terms of service, I find the servers have a bit of an attitude.</li><li>I have lunch at least once a week; generally very tranquil and the servers are very helpful and low-key.</li><li>I think they should have more servers to accommodate the amount of customers they have.</li><li>It was n't too busy where the servers were rushing around.</li><li>I went with a party 8 people on a Friday evening and it was really quite busy and only 2 servers and they did tremendously well.</li><li>There are a few new servers that I 've seen use the same gloves on the cash register and then go back to making sandwiches but the more senior staff, when present, always makes a point to remind them to put on a new pair.</li><li>The service was quick, efficient, and servers were really friendly!</li><li>Even though they were super busy, you could never really see it on the servers faces.</li><li>The service was slow but that 's because a big group came and they only had 2 servers running the show.</li><li>At the rear of the restaurant where the kitchen is located there 's a huge counter the servers use to prepare the ramen.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
