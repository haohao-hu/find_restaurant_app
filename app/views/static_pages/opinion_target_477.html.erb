<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 477' %><h2>pho dau bo<br />occurrence: 10</h2><div><ol><li>The Scarborough location of pho dau bo is a joke, the soup does n't taste half as good and is full of MSG.</li><li>One of my favorite pho restaurants in the GTA, Pho Dau Bo is fast food without any of the drawbacks of typical fast food.</li><li>There 's a certain sense of community one can only find in Vietnamese noodle houses, and Pho Dau Bo has it in spades, no matter which location you choose.</li><li>Ever since we were kids, if my folks were too lazy/pressed to make it on their own, or if we had Vietnamese guests, Pho Dau Bo is the one and only place they 'd eat at. ( this location is the finest within the GTA.)</li><li>My friend and I have been searchign for a Pho Dau Bo in our area for some good pho.</li><li>Our family used to frequent the neighbouring Peach Garden restaurant but after a couple of samplings here and definitely since our last visit this past weekend, Pho Dau Bo has solidified its place as our go-to when we crave Vietnamese food.</li><li>Yes Pho Dau Bo is a chain but this particular location is run and owned by a Vietnamese family and not Chinese owners which usually makes a significant difference in the authenticity and quality of food.</li><li>Anyway, Pho Dau Bo is an awesome place.</li><li>A group of us at work drive 15-20 min. one way to during lunch to go here and we can still make it back to work in an hr total. much praise, long live Pho Dau Bo ( this particular location only ...).</li><li>The other places ( Pho Dau Bo, Pho Mi 99, etc) failed badly in this respect and I could clearly smell the shrimp paste in their soup.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
