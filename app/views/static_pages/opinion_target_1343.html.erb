<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1343' %><h2>Kimchi fried<br />occurrence: 2</h2><div><ol><li>In this past year, I 've been there for 2 times. the most recent visit I took a few pictures, the sweet &amp; sour pork with the orange slices ( please see pictures) beside the S &amp; S pork, the 3 of us ordered the Kalbijim ( Beef Rib Stew) and the Kimchi fried rice. the banchan are good, wait, they are great.</li><li>I will never buy their food again !!! cheap place to get korean food but they use way too much msg. the interior is really old and dirty. but bc they use so much msg i got addicted to their kimchi fried rice. one of the lady 's washroom is alway broken ( i think they are fixing it on purpose) and their ingredients ( like packs of rice) are in the hall connected to the rear exit. i just find this place not clean. i 'd go somewhere else This is the restaurant in which I discovered Korean cuisine.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
