<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1257' %><h2>seafood super bowl congee<br />occurrence: 3</h2><div><ol><li>Never again. got take out from here for mother 's day dinner. called at 6.15, they said our order would be ready in 35 minutes. when we got there, everything was ready- good timely service, even during dinner on a holiday. i was impressed with that. ca n't say the same for dine-in, as there were many people waiting to be seated. that 's to be expected though. the food was pretty good. got the seafood super bowl congee ( much smaller portion compared to dine-in), bbq sparerib with honey ( these were eh- i swear they tasted better last time), vegetable with mixed mushroom ( eh- not enough mushrooms imo), snow pea leaves ( not sure what it 's called on the menu, but these were pretty good). overall everything was pretty average. not sure if the food was a bit lower quality since there 's such a big rush of customers on mother 's day ? i 've come here a couple times before and the food was definitely better. i 'd still come back though and recommend this restaurant.</li><li>Honourable mentions include the spicy squid, seafood super bowl congee, and Fukien-style fried rice.</li><li>Some good bets: yeung chow fried rice, house seafood and mixed vegetable fried rice, and seafood super bowl congee.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
