<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 36' %><h2>soup<br />occurrence: 224</h2><div><ol><li>I told them what happened and the staff member told me that she just washed the floor so the soup would be okay.</li><li>I wasn Â´ t sure what to expect but it came out in a large stone soup bowl and the corn cake was more like a paste or extremely thick soup.</li><li>The box includes 9 pcs of sashimi, 4 pieces of sushi, soup, salad, rice, vegetable tempura and lobster tail tempura, all for $ 13.95 + tax.</li><li>The soup based is a little peppery ... and it is perfect on a cold winter day!</li><li>Had a dinner combo: soup, dessert, rice and spare ribs for ~ $ 7.</li><li>Everything was delicious, especially the soup.</li><li>At one point I coughed because it was so spicy, but the soup was so good it did n't deter me from consuming it all very quickly.</li><li>I had an egg salad sandwich that was chock full of pepper, cafe mochas that were only half filled, wrong soup, etc etc.</li><li>At about $ 8.50 each, you get soup, salad, 16 rolls, and in the winter they add 2 takoyaki, dumplings, or spring rolls.</li><li>The soup was just fine.</li><li>I ordered 2 things: Sashimi Dinner ( $ 19.99) that includes 18 pieces sashimi, rice, soup, and salad and 2 pieces of Otoro sushi ( $ 19.99).</li><li>9/10- The soup was good: not too diluted, not too salty.</li><li>Complimentary soup was offered as well, which was a nice touch.</li><li>Sushi moto is our go to sushi place The sushi is always fresh, service is always quick We come here once every week or 2 and are always happy with everything I love their maki- lots of creative options- my personal faves are the fire roll, Cali roll, tiger 's tail and dynamite Their tempura is fresh and not too breaded My husband really likes the chirashi- the fish is very fresh and the selection is good too We regularly also get the maki combo 1 for dinner- it 's a great deal and it 's enough for 2 people I also love their complimentary soup.</li><li>I like it salty, which meant my wife loved this seemingly low-sodium soup.</li><li>The soup tasted great.</li><li>The soup itself was decent.</li><li>The house special for lunch `` soup and sandwich'' $ 6.99 best deal in the area.</li><li>She got a new set of utensils and broke the chicken into pieces, and mixed it with the soup, rice and noodles.</li><li>If you think the soup a little bit blend, you can add a little bit of salt from the small container on the table.</li><li>The soup was flavorful, not too salty, and is exactly something you want on a cool day, or if you are sick.</li><li>On top of that, the soup was served with a small side of white noodles, which I wish had a bit more of.</li><li>It also came with a small soup.</li><li>However it 's not a 5/5 for me- they sometimes forget to provide included menu items like soup and also they do n't have kimchi!</li><li>The soup is very rich in ginseng and give you energy in a cold winter.</li><li>Special Seol Leong Tang, the milky color cow bone and parts soup is very healthy to the skin.</li><li>The soup- aromatic with a hint of ginseng flavor.</li><li>Since the young chicken barely had any body fat, the soup itself was not one bit greasy.</li><li>The soup was n't as special as I thought it would be.</li><li>The soup itself is very clear and subtle ( can barely taste the ginseng), and it 's great for a cold day.</li><li>The soup contains a whole young chicken and some onions.</li><li>Even being a whole chicken, it 's still quite small and you only have soup to eat.</li><li>The soup was really well done but it definitely left me a little unsatisfied.</li><li>I think the soup that came with my bimbimbap tasted better.</li><li>Have the soup.</li><li>The rice balls were too salty yet the soup was just not too sweet.</li><li>The rice cakes and bean sprout soaked up the soup.</li><li>But the soup tasted like a lot of instant noodle 's soup.</li><li>But the soup tasted like a lot of instant noodle 's soup.</li><li>The soup was a bit spicy, but everything else was good.</li><li>The soup tastes just so so, you do n't need to go to a restaurant to have it, you can make it at home ( after you try it, you will find you can cook better than the chef)!</li><li>The soup should be hot enough when it arrives at my table.</li><li>If it was n't for star anise and cloves, the soup would n't even smell or taste like pho.</li><li>The soup is salty and the thin small pieces are beef are not even worth my time.</li><li>Lunch Special ( House Special Braised Beef Noodle in Pot ( $ 5.99) came in a ceramic pot normally standard for Rice and other dishes so as done for Noodle it might have consumed some of the heat away from the slightly salty soup and the store bought Noodles.</li><li>The soup is delicious, noodles are well timed, beef is tasty.</li><li>The soup is always to full of flavour, a little less MSG would be better but then it would n't be pho joint.</li><li>I guess I have been just having sodium soup at Pho Mi 99 all this time.</li><li>I always love pho tai it 's so good and the soup is better then other pho places.</li><li>The soup had a lot of flavour.</li><li>The soup was not that great and the salad was nothing spectacular, but not horrible either.</li><li>The soup ( only one listed) is fabulous, and kebabs were very generous, well-flavoured and tender.</li><li>Had: Shrimp tempura lunch set ( $ 8.95)- Comes with 3 pieces of shrimp tempura, 4 pieces of veggie, rice, soup, salad, and three veggie sides ( today 's were sesame oil broccoli, black peppered bean sprouts, and shredded potato with mayo.</li><li>They do allow you to share this menu, but the menu does only come with one soup and one salad ( if I 'm not mistaken), and if they bring you two of either one ( usually the soup), it means you 're probably not going to get the other one ( usually the salad), so you might want to clarify which one you want.</li><li>The soup is very delicious.</li><li>All meals here come with free soup.</li><li>It came with a couple pieces of ginseng root which really enhanced the flavour of the chicken and the soup.</li><li>The Scarborough location of pho dau bo is a joke, the soup does n't taste half as good and is full of MSG.</li><li>I think this is the original location of the franchise because it 's run by Vietnamese ppl, always busy and the soup has little to NO MSG.</li><li>Choose from the classic Pho, rice, vermicelli, soup, appetizers and beverages including the yummy fruit shakes.</li><li>I typically order the pho tai bo vien, the soup is perfect authentic, or rice with grilled chicken and shredded pork skin and a fried egg.</li><li>The pho is full of meat and the soup is perfectly seasoned and not too salty.</li><li>Their soup is n't oily ( unless you go there at the very end of the day ...), and they are very generous with the amount of beef they give you.</li><li>Noodles, soup, grilled/cooked items, all meh.</li><li>After we handed in the ordering paper we waited 15mins to get the basic soup and seaweed salad, and that was after I complained to the server.</li><li>My soup was full of miscellaneous items.</li><li>The soup also came with a shrimp cake on the side, which is a shrimp still in the shell with the head still on it on a deep fried pancake.</li><li>Price: my Large soup was $ 9.00.</li><li>I can just eat the noodles and the soup: D 3.</li><li>The soup was very light and tasted like it was made from the powder from instant noodle packages.</li><li>We always try to get the soup because it 's SOOO good.</li><li>I had a pozole ( spicey stewed pork, corn soup), it was a good portion as it came with a fried tortilla with sour cream, and all the condiments to put into the soup ( radish, lettuce, oregano, cayenne pepper powder, onions) my husband had the combo which came with an enchilada, a burrito, and refried beans in a taco basket.</li><li>They cut the noodles right in front of you after they put the bowl on the table The soup was super tasty, with a lot of ice still in it--talk about Cold:) The boiled egg looked spotless.</li><li>The soup was a bit bland ( cream of mushroom) but served hot.</li><li>You have to pay $ 3.99 to add a soup and drink which I felt was very steep considering the soup is probably pre-made and just scooped from a big pot.</li><li>It comes with a choice of spring rolls, and/or soup.</li><li>The soup was awful, the beef was okay just not much flavor, The tempura shrimp were good and the Cali sushi that came with it was simple like grocery store simple in taste.</li><li>I thought the soup was pretty tasty and the portion size was generous.</li><li>We ordered the Tom yum goong soup, shrimp pad Thai and chicken red curry.</li><li>Vermicelli Soup: Nice light soup with nice cut chicken pieces, tofu, carrots, lettuce and of course vermicelli ...</li><li>The soup arrives first.</li><li>The also have great soup.</li><li>We started off with the Soup of the Day ( $ 5)- I forget what the soup was called ( the soup of the day is n't written on the menu but the server will tell you about it) but it was a sort of creamy corn soup.</li><li>The hand made noodle had great texture, however, the soup was so hot that it became overcooked by the time I ate half the bowl.</li><li>The soup was very orange in colour and of adequate spice level, but lack much seafood taste in itself.</li><li>It comes with beef and egg, which makes the soup taste so Unami !!</li><li>The broth smelled incredible but the soup was n't nearly as spicy as it looked.</li><li>The noodle was cooked just right, the soup spicy enough for `` a kick'' but notind numbingly so, and they did not skimp on the seafood, as many other places often do.</li><li>No potato in my gamjatang, and the soup was a little bland.</li><li>The soup is very delicious and not as spicy as it looks.</li><li>After we had eaten our fill, we had at least a third of our samgyupsal left, half a bowl of rice and all of our soup ( we did n't even touch the soup because we had too much food).</li><li>Spiciness and sourness was well balanced; shrimps were also big and fresh, soup came nice and hot.</li><li>2 Tom Yum Gongs just for my dad who said the soup was delish Each of the main courses came with rice and we were so hungry we polished EVERYTHING off.</li><li>I was there for the 25 dollar dinner, which provided a choice of appertizer, soup or salad, an entree, and a dessert.</li><li>She also felt that the soup smelled like cleaning supplies, which was not very appetizing.</li><li>Cold soup ( tom yum is laughable), green curry did not taste like curry, `` smoked duck'' tastes like the one I get from a bag at Loblaws ( also overcooked to****).</li><li>Anyways, it does n't matter as I 'm sure you 'll find this one will do just fine.:) P. S. Closed Wednesday. great quality and price. the people are really nice. get the duck and chicken those are the best. the soup is amazing too and vegatibles taste really good.</li><li>The soup was good, on the lighter side.</li><li>The soup was my favourite part.</li><li>The soup was a little bland ( though some would say healthy and no msg) but I would 've thought the lamb would bring flavour to it.</li><li>Stay away from this restaurant you have been warned. it 'll be the first time and most likely the last time i 'll go there. i had high expectations of a place that has lobster in their name coupled with the fact that they are in one of the more higher end areas of the city. maybe that 's the downfall. from the outside, it looks like a place that you 'd find in a old strip mall, and the interior 's more of the same. when i saw that the food and wine menu were both laminated, i started to get an idea as to what i was getting myself into both pricewise and food quality. our server was not the most attentive to our needs even though we were a group of 12, and was noticibly pushing certain items on the menu. there were also a couple of kids with us and she was n't the most friendliest person with them, seemingly just focused on doin what she needed to do to make her coin and turning the table over. not that i find it wrong but it 's not something i 'd expect from a place that you 're paying up to $ 94 for a four pound lobster. me and my friend ordered garlic shrimps to start. they were of a decent size and flavour but were lacked presentation and quantity for what we paid. i 'm not really concerned with presentation that much on the regular but the plate they served it on made it look like we were n't getting a lot or we were missing something. we both ordered a 1lb lobster with baked potato and soup. we were informed that the french fries were not available which again i would n't expect from a place where you are paying so much for your meal. my soup was a new england clam chowder that was nothing special at all. the soup nutsy or even the marche had better. the baked potato was plain with just a small dollop of sour cream to consume it with. the final item to arrive was the lobster. i ordered for it to be broiled which it did but the ' stuff' ( cause i do n't really know what the heck they decided to put on it) just made it a very messy proposition to eat. it did n't really do much to enhance the enjoyment of the lobster, and it made me wonder was it really worth the coin i just dropped for this. the whole meal just tasted only just average. the whole experience was topped off when our bill came and our waitress almost made it a point to point out that the gratuity was not included in our bill. if you really want lobster, i would just say to go to red lobster and do it there. you 'd probably pay just the same but the service would definitely be better and so would the flavours !!</li><li>When the Lobster bisque arrived, it surprises us that the soup is creamy in color.</li><li>The owner also gave us free soup ( the lobster bisque) which was amazing !!</li><li>Also when you order meal combo, they do n't give soup anymore which was so simple soup already: ( Clean and kind but not enough workers.</li><li>The soup was very peppery I could n't really enjoy it.</li><li>The soup was not all that creamy as it claimed it to be instead, it was just thick and `` creamy'' due to the starch.</li><li>I tried a sip and it tasted really wrong! i told the server that the soup tasted weird.</li><li>The tofu in the soup definitely expired.</li><li>PLus the soup is just very bland broth.</li><li>Food is decent but does n't come with anything else i.e. No soup, salad, etc.</li><li>Lamb soup noodles: the soup is so well done.</li><li>My favourite dish of the night was the Lamb Pao Mo. The lamb was very tender, the soup was very refreshing, and the Pao Mo were just the right amount of chewiness.</li><li>However, the soup was EXTREMELY salty.</li><li>At another PB location, my brother substituted his bread for soup.</li><li>The soup is very salty.</li><li>The soup was n't watered down, but it tasted like it was.</li><li>They also gave us free soup.</li><li>Ordered: Porkbelly BBQ ( Sam Kyup Sal)* Pork belly BBQ served with mushrooms, onions and veggies for wrapping* You cook this on a BBQ grill at your table* Served with green onions and you can add it to your ' ssam' Green onions with chili powder and some vinegar for you to eat with the grilled meat Ordered: Marinated Beef ( Ju Mul Luk)* Beef mixed with veggies in a sweet sauce* I much prefer this over Bulgogi which I find it to be too sweet* This you also cook at your table with the grill Ordered: Kimchi Stew ( KimChi JjiGae)* It was interesting to see vermicelli in a Kimchi stew* The soup was just spicy enough and not too sour* Usually you eat this with a bowl of rice Ordered: Dumplings ( Mandoo)* These were Mul-Mandoo which means it is cooked in boiling water* You dip this into soy sauce Ordered: Spicy Soup ( Jjam Ppong Tang)* This is usually a noodle dish but this specific one was made without for drinking* It makes a nice dish to order when you are drinking soju* Filled with seafood and veggies Ordered: Seafood Pancake ( Hae Mul Pa Jeon)* There was n't much seafood in the pancake* I did n't really enjoy this Ordered: Spicy octopus &amp; pork* This is a table top cooking with veggies, octopus and pork* You can adjust the spiciness of this dish* Usually comes in 2 portions but we added an extra serving* Because there was so much food it did take a while to cook Conclusion: Now that I 've been back 3 times and tried couple things off their menu, I am convinced that even from their never-ending menu- they serve good Korean food.</li><li>This is my favorite place to go during cold winter days when I could really use a good soup.</li><li>The soup itself could have used one more ladle of broth.</li><li>The soup itself is tasty and perfect spice.</li><li>The soup was good.</li><li>Taste-wise, the soup was spicy ( I had a spoonful of my brother 's), but there was a good amount of seafood in it.</li><li>Inside the soup were slices of pork hock and blood jello.</li><li>The soup was a little salty, but all is forgiven as everything else surpassed my expectations.</li><li>Server was in a `` loud voice'' talking to us ( feels like she 's yelling) We ordered Large soup, grilled pork with rice &amp; a veggie rolls but The server asked us to order more since we were 4 in a table.</li><li>The soup was tasty and well seasoned ( perhaps a tad on the saltier side), and had a nice kick of spice.</li><li>The flavor of the soup was nothing to write home about.</li><li>The perfect mix of rice and soup.</li><li>I ordered a meal that came with soup and salad as take out and had to ask for my soup to be included and when I got home, realized salad was n't included.</li><li>The soup and salad were fine, but the rolls were small.</li><li>The soup was so blaaaand. and the sliced bbq pork had no taste.</li><li>The soup is extremely fantastic.</li><li>Along with the soup, which will come in a heated bowl so the soup will stay warm the entire time.</li><li>This is the first time I had the traditional crunchy rice soup which was a wonderful cleanse after eating the spicy soup.</li><li>The texture of the tofu is to die for, and the soup is generally bursting with flavour.</li><li>So yes eat around it and at the end you have this perfectly delicious medium boiled egg to enjoy that does n't disrupt your soup!</li><li>Flavorful soup, silky tofu, seafood, perfectly cooked rice, freshly cracked eggs half cooked in the soup, plus the water soaking the flavor of burned rice bottom on the stone bowl, it 's a perfect combination of flavors and texture.</li><li>The soup starts off with a refreshing beef taste and then the taste slowly deteriorated.</li><li>The tofu in the soup was unbelievable, velvety texture and mild flavour soaked up the broth very well.</li><li>The soup was accompanied by purple rice served out of a sizzling stone pot, I love purple rice!</li><li>Great tofu, soup was a bit on the salty side but the rice helped with that.</li><li>Steven thought his soup was a little bland; he got the mild spicy level kimchi soup.</li><li>It turned out that his soup was n't salted at all!</li><li>That bland soup was pretty bad lol.</li><li>The bugolgi however, is n't all that great, stick with the soup.</li><li>They served the soup and rice at the same time- the soup was still bubbling when the server placed it down on the table!</li><li>The soup had mussels, shrimp, tofu, and cabbage.</li><li>The price was very reasonable for the quantity of soup, rice, and banchan we received.</li><li>The soup had a lot flavor inside with the right amount of spice inside the broth.</li><li>The rice was a nice complement to enjoy with the soup.</li><li>The soup had lots of flavour and goes really well with the rice.</li><li>I only deducted 0.5 because the soup is sometimes on the salty side and the eggs they give you are extra tiny! `` everyone knows, when you go to Buk Chang 's, it 's for the soon tofu. unless you have a serious aversion to the texture of silk, do as the locals do and order one of the gloriously smooth tofu soups. they are THE BEST in the city! although, soon tofu is sometimes referred to as stew, it 's more like a light, flavourful broth with pieces of vegetables, tofu, and sometimes meat. it 's served piping hot, and in my opinion, best eaten in the colder months. hints: parking is in the back alley nearby subway is finch station, head south 2 blocks see jimi 's review of the toronto location at: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/buk-chang-dong-soon-tofu-toronto.</li><li>The soup was A-OK in my books, a little too sweet for my tastes, but the flavours were new and exciting and I was n't going to poo poo them for introducing me to something new.</li><li>The soup was really flavourful and lots and lots of tofu.</li><li>The one time we went to visit, the soup was tasteless and far below our expectation compared to the buckchang tofu in downtown Korean Town ...</li><li>I love the purple rice -- do n't get freaked out when they pour water into the stone pot after they scoop the rice out, it makes for a nice watery-congee-like soup after your meal ( if you like that).</li><li>The soup itself was very thick &amp; super salty.</li><li>The soup was flavourful and sweet.</li><li>The soup was a bit too salty ( almost msg-ish), and all it was was just tofu and shrunken up shrimp.</li><li>I like being able to choose how spicy I want the soup.</li><li>The soup itself is very good.</li><li>Not only do you get the soup that fills your tummy with superpowers ( hell yeah), but you get a big bowl of rice and unlimited side dishes! unlimited !? yes.* great place to meet a friend that you have n't seen for awhile* hell, eat solo there too, plenty of seats ... but expect to wait a bit during the supper time 6-8:30pm ? roughly. waiting time is no more than 15 mins max cheers and enjoy! if you 're 3 or more, order the sizzling bulgogi on the hot plate to share !! when you have something that sizzles, you ca n't go wrong.</li><li>I can understand the appeal of this place ( cheap, comforting soup in the cold Toronto winter) but I have to say it 's gone downhill in the few years that I had n't visited.</li><li>Second flaw was that my ideal image of soon tofu is when they rush it over to your table, the soup is hot and bubbling over the stone bowl.</li><li>The tofu is so soft and silky and the soup is delicious -- not too sour, which is the problem I find with some other restaurants, and a little bit thicker consistency in my opinion.</li><li>Overall one of my favorite Korean spots in North York. love this place! friendly environment, reasonable price and delicious soup! the only thing they could work on is perhaps on the decorations inside the restaurant, but when the food is so good and fast, who cares if the walls are bare.</li><li>They provide for you a range of spiciness that you want your soup to be, I always tend to lean for medium! &amp; if it is your first time, your dish always comes with a egg, which you usually crack into the soup when you get it, so make sure you keep stirring until its cooked or to your preference.</li><li>They provide for you a range of spiciness that you want your soup to be, I always tend to lean for medium! &amp; if it is your first time, your dish always comes with a egg, which you usually crack into the soup when you get it, so make sure you keep stirring until its cooked or to your preference.</li><li>The soup tastes average, toppings: poor, side dishes: average, service: not great, meh Is n't worth the money, not even eight bucks.</li><li>The tofu is very silky and the soup has a nice kick to it if you order anything above mild spiciness.</li><li>The food is dry and the soup is awful!</li><li>The soup is unbelievably good, with an unbelievably good pricetag to go with it.</li><li>$ 8 flat after tax for the soup, rice, and 4x sidedishes ( which you can get a second round of if you 're so inclined, free of charge).</li><li>Mild has almost no taste while medium is not that spicy either, although I do n't drink the soup.</li><li>For $ 9, you get pretty full from all the soup, rice, and banchai.</li><li>The soon tofu is silky smooth and the soup has just the right amount of heat in it.</li><li>-Minestrone soup- housemade with love:) small size is $ 5 + tax- Daily pasta- today 's was fresh cheese-filled ravioli blanketed under a heavy rose-alfredo cream sauce.</li><li>The soup is quiet large, there is a massive pork bone bathing in pork broth.</li><li>The soup is garnished with peppercorns and onions.</li><li>The flavour of the soup is fairly rich and good although I remember it being somewhat spicier in the past.</li><li>It is quite savoury and besides the meat, the soup has potato, vegetables, and perilla seeds.</li><li>Maybe because the soup has an extra kick that no other Toronto Korean Restaurant has ... for some reason all other restaurant 's Pork Bone Soup all taste the same .. but this one is different.</li><li>It 's got this awesome sweet soup that is filled with sweet meat, mushrooms, some noodles, and a few greens ( leeks ?).</li><li>That dish probably had less than 1oz of chicken and the soup was very bland.</li><li>The soup is not to spicy but full of flavour.</li><li>It was like ordering water off the menu for $ 8.99 because the soup was like water, no flavour at all, chicken broth i got in my noodle soup was certainly less than an ounce which is really misleading and annoying.</li><li>Our waitress was nearly useless in terms of notifying us of the daily special, soup, the drinks, the portion of the nachos and it took forever to get our bills.</li><li>On the positive side, the Korean BBQ beef coleslaw sandwich and fries were really delicious ... i did n't even need to use their special garlic dill dip but i recommend ordering the dip with your fries to have a fresh change from ketchup sometimes. today 's soup was beef barley which was average as was the double amaretto sour however i was pleased they offered fresh options and could accommodate my off-menu drink request. final tip- do not order the nachos here. they were pretty bad ... happy i can always get great nachos at my joint fox n fiddle finch. hope the manager can fix the crappy service here because I 'd like to come back to watch a game and taste the fajita tacos, fish tacos or one of their tempting burgers. ok last last tip i dont know if i should write this but the servers are pretty so i guess that could be a plus for those who appreciate that sort of thing.</li><li>If they can cut back on those garnish, the soup would be wonderful.</li><li>The soup was also not as flavourful.</li><li>We ordered pork dumplings in soup, beef and vegetable meal, wonton soup, vsteamed vegetables and seafood basket.</li><li>The soup was mildly spicy and the beef was perfect.</li><li>And the base of the soup is great too although I would n't drink it on its ' own.</li><li>The menu is very simple, and has decent tasty soup.</li><li>Well, who needs soup ?!?</li><li>The soup itself was pretty good; the broth was a bit too salty but did have a spicy kick that led to some sweaty yelpers.</li><li>The soup is loaded with pork bones and it felt like it was an endless journey just trying to finish it!</li><li>The flavour of the soup is delicious and the meat just falls off the bone.</li><li>Overall I find both my soup and the side dishes to be really good, which adds some point for the restaurant.</li><li>The soup itself was okay but I would n't call it authentic.</li><li>Overall, not a flavourful soup.</li><li>The soup I heard is not seasoned enough.</li><li>I declined but the guy was like, `` come on, you 're getting a free entree, you may as well get a soup!''</li><li>The entire meal ( 1 entree plus 1 soup cause of the deal) came to over $ 50 plus tip.</li><li>Miso soup was always really good- never skimping on the amount of miso.</li><li>The soup isnt the most strongest or anything special but it does the job.</li><li>When you order a teppanyaki meal, you get soup, salad, the meal, and desert.</li><li>The appearance of the soup is great but the taste was a bit of a let-down.</li><li>After asking us for drinks we did n't get it until we prompted her again after our soup was served.</li><li>Actually feels a bit like a rip off since a small soup or salad is usually complimentary at fancier a la carte Japanese restaurants.</li><li>The fermented taste was really interesting and the soup was very tasty.</li><li>It 's a thicker soup that 's made out of crushed beans so it has a different taste than the broth type soup.</li><li>The soup had a strong ginger taste and was not as salty as other pork bone soups I have had which is a good thing.</li><li>The soup and salad starters came fairly quickly, but after that it was a waiting game.</li><li>$ 19.95 for a half lobster, appetizers and a main with salad, soup etc.</li><li>I thought it could be more appropriately named as a salt or briny soup or whatever with some greens thrown in.</li><li>The soup had tofu and some beef and veggies in it.</li><li>She brought one out and my cousin asked for another box as she wanted to take the pork home since she did n't eat it and only drank the soup.</li><li>- Favorite noodle: beef &amp; black bean, or shrimp in scrambled egg sauce- Favorite rice: smoked salmon, or yin-yang rice- Favorite side dish: snow pea greens &amp; oyster mushrooms, spicy fried garoupa, wonton in soup, shrimp &amp; chive rice noodle rolls Portions are bigger in the restaurant than if you order takeout, but huge either way:).</li><li>The food was average, but the three course meal ( soup, entree and dessert) for like $ 15 is like a super deal, while everywhere else around the city is like price gouging over the same holiday.</li><li>The soup however is a disappointment.</li><li>I knew this cafe way back in my University days ... we used to come and get the yummy pastry and go. over the years, they started serving lunch, which are normally well priced with soup, dessert and tea/coffee included.</li><li>Ok when I 'm hungry, soup is n't the first thing that comes to mind.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
