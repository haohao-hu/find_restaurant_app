<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 859' %><h2>marinara sauce<br />occurrence: 5</h2><div><ol><li>My sandwich was pretty good, although perhaps could 've used a touch more marinara sauce.</li><li>Pene cooked al-dente, and most of all the marinara sauce was not acidic, but rather smooth .... 4.5/5 !!!!!!</li><li>My aunt ordered the Seafood Creole ( $ 16)- shrimp, calamari, clams, salmon, mussels, linguine pasta, and a marinara sauce.</li><li>I had the chance to try it and while I liked it more than my dish, I thought its seafood components overpowered the dish- I know it 's a seafood pasta, and there 's a lot of ingredients from the sea in it to prove it, but they did n't blend too well with the marinara sauce and with each other.</li><li>On our visit, we ordered a Biang-Biang Mian ( hand-slapped and pulled ribbon noodles, stewed beef, sauteed tomato fried egg, and mixed vegetables) and a Lamb Pao Mo ( lamb stew, bean sprout, organic cloud ear mushroom, tomato, ground garlic, ginger and scallion with hand pulled noodles stir fried in wok, finished with house special marinara sauce) plus wood ear mushroom to share.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
