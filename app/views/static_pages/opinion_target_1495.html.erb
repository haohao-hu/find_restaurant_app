<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1495' %><h2>eggplant salad<br />occurrence: 2</h2><div><ol><li>They also somehow allow them to bud in line. just had food from here this morning, last night, earlier in the day yesterday, just after a first breakfast yesterday morning and im hoping to polish off the remnants over the next couple of days. hows that for committed ? like all great middle eastern places, i only have them when i am north of eglinton. this is not a frequent occurrence, for good reason. however, when im there, i delight in their robust falafel balls that crunch on the outside and warm your mouth with the softness of a pillow on the inside. this holds true even when they are cold- except for the crunchy part, but NEVER are they dry like virtually all falafel places south of there. the salads are fresh, tasty, albeit a little oily- but i cant resist the eggplant salad even though its bathing in oil. the pita is the only kind i enjoy- a big circular pocket thats fluffy and fresh. the hummous and tehina are perfect in their consistency, and spice. the only thing that i dont like from this place, is when you go inside and order a falafel sandwich ... its gargantuan ... so much so that you have no idea how to approach it ... and you want to approach it ... its like a hot sexy big assed, big breasted, big lipped woman. ( not quite sure if that metaphor worked but, i gave it a go at least.).</li><li>I also buy the eggplant salad and cream cheese to go along with the bagels.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
