<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 267' %><h2>waiting<br />occurrence: 21</h2><div><ol><li>The waiting staff is quick polite and attentive.</li><li>Sadly, after 20minutes of waiting ( approx.</li><li>This chain of McD 's has computer for ordering if you can pay in credit or debit, and while waiting in line I found that the staff was busy diverting people to the computer kiosks ... while there were 3 cashiers available, only 1 was being used.</li><li>A few of my favourites off the top of my head ...- avocado milkshake- pho with beef balls and rare beef- chicken pho- banh cuon- spring rolls ( or egg rolls, whatever you want to call it)- com tam This place is small for the amount of customers dining and waiting to get into the restaurant.</li><li>It 's just so good and the waiting is n't that long.</li><li>Even though this Starbucks is far away from home, I do end up waiting here a lot.</li><li>We ended up waiting ~ 20 minutes for a table for two at 7pm on a Friday night.</li><li>I have both eaten in and gotten it to go- in the time it takes me to walk over there ( 6-7 mins) it 's waiting for me and since I have ordered the same thing each time ( the three times I have asked for it to go as opposed to eating in) they know I want extra hot sauce and paying attention like that is a good indicator of how conscientious they are with the menu/ingredients etc.</li><li>No waiting is always a plus.</li><li>Due to the slow service, the waitress gave us complementary soups and pop which was nice- but dunno if that makes up for all the waiting.</li><li>After waiting in line so long and to be forced in to trying to get two huge portions simply for two people is crazy.</li><li>The whole idea of a take-out service is that you save time and get your food in time when you come in instead of waiting in line ?</li><li>Makes pick up much easier Ps do n't park right infront of the place, I got a 250 $ parking ticket there once while waiting for my food, and I was leaning on my car, the owner told me how they have got over 11 of those tickets.</li><li>Worth waiting for a table.</li><li>Paying the bill is such a hassle too, I wait forever for the one waiter to finally show face, and waiting him to bring back a credit card machine is another story.</li><li>Good thing we were n't one of the people outside waiting for a seat.</li><li>Be sure to expect about 15mins of waiting in line if you decide to come at dinner time.</li><li>Worth the waiting!</li><li>It should not take 20 minutes to assemble one sandwich, especially when all the contents of said sandwich are already cooked and prepared, waiting to be placed between a bun.</li><li>During all this waiting I was subject to total rudeness for no apparent reason.</li><li>I was not acknowledged until I had to make it more obvious that I have been waiting in line for a while.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
