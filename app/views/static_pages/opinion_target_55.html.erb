<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 55' %><h2>dinner<br />occurrence: 122</h2><div><ol><li>But this place looked cute and small, and the appeal of dim sum for dinner was nice!</li><li>One is Free Dinner on your birthday.</li><li>The `` Free Dinner'' did not have an asterisk beside it on their menu but their 15% off did.</li><li>The manager said that the fine print applied to both promotions even tho there was n't an asterisk on the `` Free Dinner''.</li><li>Great quality sushi, fun for occasions with a group or a romantic night out for dinner and drinks.</li><li>I have never had to wait for a seat and I 've come for dinner here twice.</li><li>I had the pleasure to have dinner here a week ago.</li><li>Ordered Dinner got appetizers and the manager noticed we had n't gotten our entree 's yet so bought us a round, sincerely apologized and, then went out of his way to personally stay attentive while they got us our meals.</li><li>Sushi moto is our go to sushi place The sushi is always fresh, service is always quick We come here once every week or 2 and are always happy with everything I love their maki- lots of creative options- my personal faves are the fire roll, Cali roll, tiger 's tail and dynamite Their tempura is fresh and not too breaded My husband really likes the chirashi- the fish is very fresh and the selection is good too We regularly also get the maki combo 1 for dinner- it 's a great deal and it 's enough for 2 people I also love their complimentary soup.</li><li>You can place your beer right into the ice and keep it cool for your entire dinner.</li><li>The dinner was wonderful, nice creamy sauce with delicious chicken.</li><li>I ordered the lasagna for dinner ( $ 16).</li><li>When I come for dinner, I like to get a pizza appetizer and sometimes, I 'll also get the calamari.</li><li>I had been here maybe a year ago for dinner and they remembered me!</li><li>My mom had introduced me to this restaurant a while back and whenever we are deciding on where to go for dinner we always end up choosing here.</li><li>Order two of these for dinner because it is that good and you wo n't want anything else.</li><li>Price for dinner is pretty decent for the amount and quality of the food that you are getting.</li><li>We ordered the grilled octopus with rice cake and kimchi tofu soup for a dinner of two.</li><li>I came here for dinner and the food was really good.</li><li>Both times I tried their All You Can Eat option, once for lunch and once for dinner.</li><li>AYCE brunch goes from 11-3pm, AYCE dinner is 3-10pm.</li><li>With their new all you can eat menu, it 's pretty great- there are tons of things to try like chinese dimsum, sushi, pad thais and other noodes, even kalbi- all for $ 18.99 on weekends, more for dinner, cheaper on weekdays.</li><li>I 've been for dinner and lunch.</li><li>It had a typical modern Italian restaurant feel you would usually take your family out for dinner on a special occasion.</li><li>This place is fairly expensive for a tavern, definitely above average bar prices but when you have dinner you have to order the bread and butter for $ 3.5 where most nice restaurants at a similar price point just bring the bread over.</li><li>I came here for dinner because I saw the awesome reviews, but after ordering their oyako-don, I was pretty disappointed- the flavour was subpar and the rice itself was non-traditional.</li><li>After we ordered the dinner, the server told us there 's a Sunday special- if our order is over $ 30, we will have a free appetizer.</li><li>Had a dinner for two.</li><li>Our office is on Yong St north of Finch in City of Toronto and at least 12 times in any year we have either dinner or lunch at your restaurant at 5000 Yonge St Last Wednesday ( June 10th) my assistant made a reservation for 5.</li><li>Tucked inside a small, dark, less than desirable strip plaza, we just randomly walked into the restaurant for a table for 2 for dinner at around 7.30pm.</li><li>I was able to devour my courses hurriedly with the aid of my most helpful server, but would highly suggest that you visit Samjung Sushi for a nice intimate dinner instead.</li><li>Really, I felt like I was a little kid, eating dinner at a friend 's house ( particularly since I grew up in the area).</li><li>A little too early for dinner but a deal is a deal and I am into specials ...</li><li>Walking into High Street Fish and Chips on this Saturday for an early dinner made me wondering if I am in Toronto anymore ...</li><li>And it was only 6 PM, I guess people have dinner early here!: P Closed Sundays and Mondays!</li><li>Anyways the food here is good and if you have a lot of time to spare for dinner, then it is fine.</li><li>Cost ( 3/5): ~ $ 27 for dinner ..</li><li>Although the lunch buffet price is half of dinner and there seemed to be over 75 + items listed, nothing but the dinner only items stood out ( no sashimi for lunch), I personally would n't make my money worth by coming here for lunch.</li><li>If I 'm coming back again, it would be for dinner because there is no sashimi for lunch.</li><li>I was there for dinner at weekend.</li><li>I wanted to like this place and to be quite honest I do n't think I can rate it fairly when I was n't able to try dinner as I currently have a bun in my oven ... seemed pointless to go for dinner when I ca n't eat the best part ... sashimi.</li><li>With weekend pricing, dinner was $ 27 + tax + tip, which is pricier than my last two places, but is n't the price of everything going up ? ( especially in Canada these days ...)</li><li>Service is quick and friendly. went for lunch before and went again for dinner, the sashimi were fresh and thick cut the way they are suppose to be and the beef and the scallop sashimi was delishhhhhh !!!</li><li>The price for adults on weekend for lunch: $ 15.95; for dinner: $ 25.95.</li><li>For Dinner, Sinchon Food serves more family style like in a big hot pot starting from $ 27 ..</li><li>It 's a favourite place of my Grandfather-in-law ( is that a thing ??) so we end up here most nights we have dinner with them.</li><li>I 've come here a few times for dinner, lunch and take out.</li><li>All in all, we left this place around 10:30 and there will still a lot of guests eating dinner and drinking, which means my find for a late-night spot in my area is now over.</li><li>It ai n't the west coast but it 'll do for dinner or lunch; I go here regularly, maybe too regularly. i remember in University we used to come here all the time, because the choices were either this ( and it was n't even that cheap) or sapporo sushi up the street.</li><li>For lunch they have a buffet but for dinner it is a la carte.</li><li>This restaurant is close to the Toronto Centre for Arts, so its great for dinner and a show.</li><li>The service was good though, and the place was getting packed later on the dinner shift so it is a popular place.</li><li>This was an excellent place for dinner when visiting Shops at Don Mills.</li><li>I was there for the 25 dollar dinner, which provided a choice of appertizer, soup or salad, an entree, and a dessert.</li><li>I 've been here for lunch, for dinner, with small parties and with large groups- the food and the service is very consistent.</li><li>Best dish is the panang curry- Beef panang ( lunch and dinner portions are prepared differently- dinner is crispy), or my favourite, the Thai Islamic Noodles with shrimp and chicken.</li><li>I am absolutely ashamed that this restaurant exists- why decline customers that are clearly looking to spend money on a dinner and then accept otherwise.</li><li>At $ 120 for 2 for dinner Linda is an authentic, delicious but relatively pricey dinner option.</li><li>You really expect a $ 15 tip on a $ 30 dinner.</li><li>I had heard about this place years ago, finally tried the prix fixe menu for $ 25 for dinner the past weekend.</li><li>We came here for dinner and was greeted by a very friendly waiter:) From first glance, the decor had a really traditional Thai feel but still lived up to the modern in its name.</li><li>Thai iced tea was n't the greatest either. after eating dinner at Linda, s modern thai last night, I would not refer anyone who like, s good thai food to go there.the food is plan, and the portions are very small, well the price, s are high. dinner with two dish, s and a small salad was around seventy five dollar, s.we had to pick up food on the way home as we were still not full.there are so many better thai place, s in Toronto.</li><li>They know that the pig is just about to come out so they will buy it for dinner.</li><li>I believe it ranges between 14.99 and 18.99 depending on whether it is lunch or dinner and which day of the week it is but do n't quote me on that.</li><li>I went for dinner with my in laws hoping to get a nice seafood dinner after reading some good reviews about the food.</li><li>Dinner was under $ 30 plus tip.</li><li>He loves Chinese food, so I recommended that we have dinner here.</li><li>We usually go on the weekdays for dinner when there are n't much line ups.</li><li>I had dinner here twice.</li><li>We came here for late night dinner, had the king 's tea pork ribs with rice combo.</li><li>This is one of my go-to 's for a reasonably priced dinner and drink.</li><li>Two portions for two people for lunch was more than sufficient, and even two portions for three people for dinner plus a side of dumplings was fine too.</li><li>Wow!, dinner was pitifully lousy !!</li><li>Italian sausage penne- A great choice for dinner They 've done a great job with the restaurant itself too.</li><li>Came here for dinner on Christmas Eve by chance as many restaurants in this neighbourhood had been affected by the ice storm, nothing was open and we were starving.</li><li>A family of five orders the following for dinner: Bamboo and Dried Scallop Soup, Deep-fried Soft Shell Crab, Peking Duck Special, Lobster fried in salt and pepper, and Shanghai Noodles with beef.</li><li>When I went last for dinner at a normal dinner time around 8pm it was nearly empty there.</li><li>I would like to return, for dinner as they still feature the old cantonese cuisine.</li><li>Overall the dinner is good.</li><li>The prices are a bit high for lunch but for dinner, this would be a good option.</li><li>Visited Fri Nov 25 for dinner ( Party of 2) I called to make reservations, and they say they do n't take reservations.</li><li>The food Marche serves for appetizers and main courses for brunch, lunch and dinner are pretty good too!</li><li>I usually get the dinner for two for my husband and I which is more than enough food for 2 ppl.</li><li>The Groupon deal was for a dinner for two people.</li><li>The dinner sets are in the $ 14-17 range and typically only come with a bowl of rice.</li><li>My friends and I had dinner here yesterday because it was the closest sushi restaurant by Yorkdale that was n't AYCE.</li><li>I was seriously craving sushi and decided to pop in here for dinner with a friend after work.</li><li>Go early during the weekends for dinner since there 's always a line up after 6pm!</li><li>Dinner was so filling.</li><li>I only paid a total of $ 10 including tip which is super cheap for dinner!</li><li>I also think it says a lot this place was bursting at the seams--with a line coming out the door and everything--during both the dinner and lunch services I ate at.</li><li>Would you take your family out for dinner where you place order foods for 4 people, wait 45min. and it never did show up on your table ?</li><li>The dinner was awful.</li><li>Came for dinner ( had dinner for two).</li><li>Fortunately, we did n't have to wait too long to be seated and was able to eye what other tables were having for dinner.</li><li>Stopped by for dinner and was not disappointed.</li><li>I do believe they use the same menu for lunch and dinner, which would explain the dinner-like price point.</li><li>I 've been here multiple times, sometimes for a lunch or relaxed dinner.</li><li>She urged us to stay and have dinner.</li><li>Your dinner does n't come with a free korean pancake like Oh Geul Boh Gol 's though, oh well,- 1 star!</li><li>For the 4 `` skewers'' /kebobs, it actually was charged as 3 full dinner sized meals, which the waiter did n't make clear.</li><li>AND it 's cheap too- $ 18.95 for dinner ( Mon- Thur).</li><li>Many (!) menus in both English and Chinese ( e.g. lunch specials, dim sum, dinner, etc.).</li><li>Buffet at lunch ... a la carte for dinner and they deliver .. no complaints!</li><li>$ 40- $ 65, salads $ 15- $ 20, sushi $ 20 + the dinner adds up quickly.</li><li>Salad, Soup Teppanyaki main plate that consists of Chicken, Beef, Scallops, Zucchini, Onions and mushrooms with a single scoop of ice cream to finish the dinner.</li><li>My husband and I had ordered chicken and meat loaf on Thursday I think from the dinner for two menu and it was absolutely delicious ... however the regular menu we ordered from at our last visit was very dissapointing!</li><li>Great new spot in my hood with such warm ambiance great for families or friends for dinner, coffee, dessert or all of the above.</li><li>For dinner I had the pesto salmon.</li><li>It was a very filling dinner, so we could have removed 2 rolls from the meal.</li><li>This is kinda self serve but it 's good because there 's a lot of variety for dinner:) also alcohol everywhere on each table &amp; a open bar: D.</li><li>It seems odd to go to a banquet hall for dinner when it 's not a wedding, and at one point, I thought we were crashing one after walking past a bride and groom posing for pictures.</li><li>In fact it is good enough for two meals- I always go there for late lunch and pack the rice with the eel for dinner.</li><li>Their lunch and dinner looked fine from the tables around.</li><li>After dinner, two of our party asked to share a small 20-year-old port for twenty dollars a glass.</li><li>$ 22 Dinner on weekends !!!</li><li>I 'd come back and I 'd recommend this to anyone who is interested in doing something a little different and a little more casual for dinner with a group of people.</li><li>Ive never been there for dinner because I find it too expensive-over $ 20.00, not worth it to me.</li><li>The restaurant was busy even at 4:30pm on Sunday. if you want to get seats for dinner, better go before 6pm.</li><li>I ate half for dinner last night and half for lunch today.</li><li>We got something similar to a tortilla chip with some veggies in a spicy sauce to dip. ( Not sure what it is called but it was good) I plan on going again to try their lunch buffet! we ordered dinner for two when we stopped by. had bad experience with other buffet style indian food in the past- everything seems a lot more watered down. some of the stuff was good in the pre-fixe menu, some are kinda weird. i liked the tandori chicken and the lamb stew thing. grilled shrimp was mediocre. the long log of some sort of meat was not very good. naan was fresh and crispy so that was a plus. had some leftovers to take home for the next day even. food is alright, not fantastic.</li><li>Dinner was alright.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
