it came with an assortment of vegetables, raw veal and a raw egg on top allowing you to cook said egg and veal to your liking in the hot stone pot.</li><li>The other dish Bibimbap was presented so colorful mixed rice with meat and assorted vegetables.</li><li>The seasoned vegetables ( which topped the bibimbap) were fresh and meticulously prepared; some were also uncommon like the acorn jelly.</li><li>Bibimbap had a lot of different vegetables, even had acorn jelly in it too.</li><li>Ordered: Gae-Jang ( marinated raw crab) 2/5* Plate of marinated crab for $ 12.99* You can order soy sauce based or spicy sauce based* I ordered soy sauce based Gae Jang* Basically you get 2 small crabs all cracked up* Soy sauce marinade was decent but a little too sweet* What turned me off from this is how the crabs did n't taste very fresh* Although it is marinated, because you are eating this raw- freshness is quite important* My mouth felt a little dry/tough after eating this and it was n't very pleasant* The claw part was n't cracked and there was no way I could break it with my teeth* I was quite disappointed with this dish since I was looking forward to it Ordered: CheolPan JjooGgooMi ( baby squid stir fry) 5/5* Baby squid stir fried with vegetables and ricecake for two people at $ 19.99* This was recommended by my friend who 's had it before* It 's meant for 2 people and cooked at your table* This is very spicy ( be aware !!)* It came with lots of baby squid, ricecakes and vegetables* Sauce was very intense in flavor ( spices) and it was good to eat with rice* I thought it was kind of odd how they had broccoli in it* I loved this dish and would go back just for it Complimentary: Kong Bi Ji* This is a grinded up bean paste that people like to eat with the rice* I am not a big fan of beans .... or grinded up beans so I did n't really enjoy it* But my friend said it was really good!</li><li>The guys behind the counter here are pretty generous with the amount of rice, vegetables ( e.g. lettuce, pickel, onions, beets), and chicken they pile on your plate.</li><li>My last criticism is that they could have mixed/spread the vegetables and meat together more evenly.</li><li>I loved all the yummy fresh, crispy vegetables in my wrap!</li><li>The meat and vegetables used are high quality so the final product is excellent.</li><li>Lots of food and the vegetables are always well done.</li><li>Tempura shrimp &amp; vegetables were perfectly crunchy and light.</li><li>Just noodle with some vegetables, no soup but with some spring rolls and meat.</li><li>The soup base was excellent, the meat was tender and the accompanying vegetables add greatly to the flavour of the soup ( my friend told me the those greens are the secret to most Vietnamese dishes, so do n't ditch them).</li><li>Soup was slightly salty, but we devoured the noodles ( cooked perfectly), the soft, luscious chicken and other vegetables.</li><li>Parsnip potato puree ( like a mash), seasonal vegetables, mushrooms and dijon cream sauce.</li><li>The ' seasonal' vegetables were sparse and bland, ( My carrots were mostly raw and unpeeled ... muddy veins ... really ??).</li><li>The vegetables were good and the ros√© sauce was very good.</li><li>Not the fanciest place around, BUT: the size of the pita pocket was HUGE, the chicken tasty, the vegetables definitely fresh, the hummous could have used a bit more garlic and lemon juice.</li><li>From vegetables to meat fish was too based and buffalo chicken was overly salty and spicy and had freezer smell.</li><li>I mean, going to a steak place and eating vegetables right ?</li><li>I liked that the vegetables ( broccoli, peppers, carrots, bok choy and cabbage) were not covered in oil/grease.</li><li>Just a sour broth with frozen vegetables and 2 pieces of shrimp.</li><li>Braised Lamb Shank ( $ 19)- great value as the dish is good portion with a lot of sides of fresh vegetables!</li><li>I just feel like this restaurant is trying to get away with serving meals with no sustenance ie no meat no real vegetables.</li><li>The accompanying side vegetables were equally savoury ( no doubt also infused with a broth of sorts) and the potatoes were simple but delicious.</li><li>I must ask for a little taste before I decide whether to buy salads, vegetables, turkey burgers etc.</li><li>Perfectly cooked, and served with seasonal vegetables- this veal chop was so delicious.</li><li>The daily special of veal pizzialoa was tender and the vegetables were crisp tender and very good.</li><li>There is very limited seating inside, though I usually found a table for myself because almost everyone buys their fruits and vegetables and leaves.</li><li>I asked her what vegetables could be used in the juicer and she seemed annoyed.</li><li>Located in the middle of York Lanes on campus, Berries &amp; Blooms contains a very large counter of dozens of trays, filled with hordes of fresh fruit and vegetables that is stocked daily.</li><li>I got us grilled eggplant, tempura shrimp and vegetables, seafood salad and house salad.</li><li>They fill the pocket with freshly made falafel balls, heaps of beautiful vegetables, and finish with tons delicious hummus, tahini, and hot sauce.</li><li>Their fried rice is really good and I especially enjoy the Yeung Chow fried rice that comes with a variety of meats and vegetables.</li><li>The vegetables were all crisp and not overly salty at all.</li><li>Ordered: Dak-Gal-Bee ( JS-1) 4/5* Chicken ( boneless dark meat) and assorted vegetables ( cabbage, sweet potato and greeon onion)* Choose your spiciness ( we went with B. The Joons Original Spicy Sauce)* $ 9.25 per portion ( 2 portions minimum), we ordered 3 portions for 3 people* Extra Add On: rice cake, mozzarella cheese, instant noodle, vegetables and fried rice* Extra add ons are all $ 2 except the fried rice* Everything is thrown together and comes to your table uncooked* Because it 's chicken, they take a while to fully cook and it drives you crazy* Servers will come around and cook them for you so do n't worry about the process* If you order mozarella cheese, they come midway and add it on near the end* For 3 portion order, I found there were n't much chicken* Original spicy sauce is not spicy at all !!</li><li>Ordered: Dak-Gal-Bee ( JS-1) 4/5* Chicken ( boneless dark meat) and assorted vegetables ( cabbage, sweet potato and greeon onion)* Choose your spiciness ( we went with B. The Joons Original Spicy Sauce)* $ 9.25 per portion ( 2 portions minimum), we ordered 3 portions for 3 people* Extra Add On: rice cake, mozzarella cheese, instant noodle, vegetables and fried rice*

chicken* Original spicy sauce is not spicy at all !!</li><li>The vegetables were fairly bland.</li><li>Sunrise is part grocery store and you can also find imported jams, canned fruit and vegetables that you do n't see elsewhere.</li><li>The potatoes were hard and the vegetables were not tasty.</li><li>The chicken was seasoned well enough, and the portion was large, but the pasta was nothing special as it was dried pasta, and the vegetables seemed like it was from frozen.</li><li>Noodles with vegetables $ 16.99- there was enough noodles to feed 2-3 people.</li><li>5) jap chae ( stir fried noodle with vegetables)- lots of veggies and meat, always comes out super hot and fresh, and never gets too ' sticky' or ' clumpy'. one of the best places for jap chae.</li><li>It was spicy just the way I like it and it comes with tons of vegetables and rice cakes too.</li><li>The staff were amazing and so helpful. we went yesterday for dinner and ordered INSALATA CAPRESE and CALAMARI FRITTI and were so good. and for the main course we ordered ORECCHIETTE AROMANTICA and a special dish ( chicken breast stuffed with cheese and spinach and vegetables on the side) and that when it went totally wrong.</li><li>The vegetables came steamed on the side with an extra bowl of rice.</li><li>It was good but because the chef probably rushed the order the vegetables were uncooked, it wasnt a delight to get a big mouth full of raw onion.</li><li>The vegetable curry dish was comprised of almost only red and green peppers with a few broccoli florets, and no other vegetables.</li><li>When we brought the fact that the vegetable dish had very little variety of vegetables, our server responded by looking blankly at us and saying, `` so would anyone like to order desert ?</li><li>It was mushy, though, perhaps because of few crunchy vegetables to balance it out.</li><li>You get a soup ( you can taste the ingredients), vegetables, a whole box of rice with your choice of BBQ meat.</li><li>The chow mein was good but typical, the vegetables and shumai were okay too, the fried fish served with the egg soup sauce was freshly fried and glorious.</li><li>I had the snow shoot vegetables ... usually when you order this dish- they fry it in oil and garlic.</li><li>The vegetables were old and hard to chew.</li><li>The vegetables on top were too tough to eat ( clearly very old). when I bit into the chicken, the meat was still pink inside.</li><li>Last time I went for food, they gave me a dish that was rice soup + chicken + vegetables.</li><li>You literally could not taste anything else, no kimchi, none of the vegetables, not even salt.</li><li>My coworker had some kind of dish served in a round kettle where everything was separated: rice, meat, vegetables, etc but then you are supposed to mix it all together.</li><li>We ordered the Dak Gal Bee with chicken to share, and thought there was limited chicken and noodles and a lot more vegetables.</li><li>I always get it with the regular level spicy ( + rice cakes, noodles and mozzarella cheese) I would recommend asking them to put less vegetables ( they always put a lot and less chicken).</li><li>The owner there is trying to cut down food cost so much that the quality of meat and vegetables that are used here is horrible.</li><li>I liked their variety of vegetables and the fact that the servings were appropriate considering how many people we were.</li><li>Food: The selection is pretty standard, a lot of fish balls, vegetables, lamb, beef slices and a seafood option that includes 1/2 lobster.</li><li>Everything we ordered was delicious from the peking duck to the vegetables to the lemon chicken.</li><li>They would n't give us wraps and vegetables until 5 minutes after they served us the duck.</li><li>I ordered the pork bibimbap, it 's just rice, vegetables, and there was n't that much meat.</li><li>Not much in the way of vegetables or starches as accompaniment though.</li><li>My friend counted at most 5-6 little pieces of chicken in the dish while it was predominantly just the noodles, with a few pieces of vegetables.</li><li>Comes with 2 shrimps and maybe 4 vegetables ranging from taro, and eggplants.</li><li>My partner &amp; I both had teriyaki ( beef &amp; salmon) &amp; the vegetables that came with were so salty.</li><li>The salad is a fresh difference from other sushi places due to the variety of vegetables used.</li><li>Chap chae, on the menu as an appetizer, but arriving last of the three items we ordered, was served piping hot and, while a little on the sweet side, was otherwise just right with lightly sauteed vegetables.</li><li>We ordered the crispy pata, sisig, squid and vegetables.</li><li>Sisig had strange texture to it, crispy pata was n't that great, and the chinese style vegetables was plain ridiculous with the size of bokchoy they used.</li><li>I only deducted 0.5 because the soup is sometimes on the salty side and the eggs they give you are extra tiny! `` everyone knows, when you go to Buk Chang 's, it 's for the soon tofu. unless you have a serious aversion to the texture of silk, do as the locals do and order one of the gloriously smooth tofu soups. they are THE BEST in the city! although, soon tofu is sometimes referred to as stew, it 's more like a light, flavourful broth with pieces of vegetables, tofu, and sometimes meat. it 's served piping hot, and in my opinion, best eaten in the colder months. hints: parking is in the back alley nearby subway is finch station, head south 2 blocks see jimi 's review of the toronto location at: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/buk-chang-dong-soon-tofu-toronto.</li><li>I `` m a big fan of the veggie one -- but that 's because I do enjoy my vegetables:) Not only that, they also serve bulgogi and dolsot bibimbap.</li><li>The tofu soup is so good with plenty of vegetables and tofu.</li><li>The meat comes pre-seasoned and and the vegetables are drenched in soy sauce and salted garlic butter.</li><li>Sausage dish was terrible and the vegetables were even worse.</li><li>Non fresh vegetables on a bed of yellow lettuce.</li><li>It is quite savoury and besides the meat, the soup has potato, vegetables, and perilla seeds.</li><li>The pork was really flavorful, served with a generous amount of vegetables ( green peppers and onions).</li><li>They gave us a free appetizer of mushrooms and vegetables!</li><li>The BBB was I thought not very tasty, all the vegetables tasted roughly the same with the buttery taste, and overall the dish was mediocre.</li><li>As your side, you can pick from fries or veggie sticks/ vegetables but once you choose one though, you cannot change it for subsequent wing orders.</li><li>We ordered pork dumplings in soup, beef and vegetable meal, wonton soup, vsteamed vegetables and seafood basket.</li><li>It 's more like a sad platter of a few soggy vegetables hiding a potato party underneath.</li><li>The vegetables were crisp.</li><li>I never knew how bad bibimbap could be until you tasted slimy vegetables from the cucumber.</li><li>I 'm not sure if it is because the cook ( doubtful a chef would work there) did not wash and dry the vegetables properly, but it just tasted slimy.</li><li>Unlike other pork bone soups I 've had this one did not have any seeds in it ( not sure what those seeds are but they sure taste good) nor did it have any green vegetables, I enjoy a little greenery in my soup and this was sorely missed.</li><li>The chicken came already cooked with the vegetables and all we did was stir it occasionally for it not to burn.</li><li>Although there were a variety of vegetables ( green beans, carrots, etc.), they were covered in an excess of oil.</li><li>Found the knife work to be a bit lazy as vegetables and meat pieces were not very uniform and some were way too big.</li><li>However, it was quite tender and the vegetables were savoury as well.</li><li>It came with a baked potato and vegetables, which were good but nothing to rave about.</li><li>All 3 were quite good with the snails being the most interesting ( roasted on a slice of roasted eggplant, hint of blue cheese), the main being the most satisfying ( sliced of tenderloin with a nice sauce and vegetables and the desert rounding things out ( 7 kinds of chocolate ... need I say more ?) ...</li><li>The mashed potatoes that came along was great, and so were the vegetables.</li><li>When building your own noodle, you choose the type of noodle, broth, protein and vegetables.</li><li>The proteins and vegetables are not bad though I wished they would give you more portion wise.</li><li>Finally I get home and when i opened the container I was disappointed that they gave me rice instead of the vegetables that I had ordered but I soon forgot all about this as i started in on the chicken.</li><li>We were there to celebrate a birthday so my dad ordered various appetizers including beef sashimi ( tender and juicy, equivalent to eating beef tartare), a sushi boat ( featuring fresh spicy tuna maki, hamachi, toro, maguro, squid with salmon roe, and raw shrimp- good to order so that everyone at the table can sample different sushi and sashimi), the usual vegetables ( aka tempura), and blue tuna spicy and California hand rolls.</li><li>I had ordered teppanyaki set ( sea food and vegetables) and sushi set.</li><li>Moving on to the main course, vegetables were n't bad.</li><li>Foodwise, the quality of the meats and vegetables were unmistakably top grade, and cooked well. p.s. you need to pay for parking, with a $ 2 discount off your bill when you provide the ticket stub.</li><li>Their vegetables are also good for the most part.</li><li>Poached Choy sum item was just regular vegetables not choy sum as advertised.</li><li>The latter 3 dishes all had the same vegetables, just different main ingredient.</li><li>The steak was delicious, and they give you the right amount of potatoes ( mashed or ovened) with a side of vegetables.</li><li>I usually prefer eating my fav dish at every Korean restaurant ... which is the Soondubu Chigae ( soft tofu stewed in a hot spicy broth with seafood and vegetables).</li><li>They have a great selection of vegetables, meat, tofu and condiments.</li><li>You walk around with a bowl, place in some meat, vegetables, sauces, garnishes, etc and pass it to a chef who takes your bowl and cooks it all on a HUGE table stove in front of you in a minute and passes it right back to you.</li><li>For those of you that do n't know, the way you eat at the Mongolian Grill is to fill an empty bowl with all sorts of raw meats, vegetables, sauces and spices and the cooks there will stir fry it before your very eyes.</li><li>The novelty with the Mongolian Grill is that you are presented with a wide variety of raw meats ( beef, pork, chicken, and lamb) and vegetables, some seafoods ( shrimps, fake crab and squid rings), noodles ( egg, rice, udon, etc.) and a stupefying selection of soupy sauces ( spicy, curry, honey garlic ... more than 10 in total) and condiment sauces ( ginger, garlic, oyster ... more than 20 in total).</li><li>During my dinner, I went up to get more food when I saw a dead fly in the vegetables.</li><li>The servers quickly replaced the vegetables and assured us that everything was safe to eat.</li><li>I had the noodles with beef, lamb and seafood with a meddly of vegetables.</li><li>Then you get in this line where you pick your meat ( choice of lamb, beef, chicken or pork), then you pick your vegetables, then noodles then whatever sauce you want.</li><li>A lot of choices, vegetables and meat are fresh.</li><li>Lots of meats, vegetables, noodles, and sauces.</li><li>The DIY stir fry section has a great variety of fresh meats, vegetables, and sauces.</li><li>The vegetables shrink after it is grilled, the way to do it is bring 2 bowls with you otherwise you 'll have to line up again.</li><li>We decided to order the supreme super bowl congee, cantonese chow mein, three kinds stuffed vegetables ( eggplant, tofu and green pepper), minced pork and dried fish green beans and fried chili turnip patties.</li><li>They also have shakshooka ( Israeli omelette with stewed vegetables) which is good.</li><li>There was a good variety of vegetables inside the soup broth and it 's a great step up from the Netsu.</li><li>I believe it was a miso base with pork and vegetables.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
