<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 5323' %><h2>sushi chirashi<br />occurrence: 1</h2><div><ol><li>There is only really 4 things i order from this place. super chirashi ( approx $ 14) enough food for you to take some home salmon chirashi ( $ 10)- never failed me sushi chirashi ( great assortment $ 10) ( accept requests for substitutes if you dont like shrimp, white tuna .. etc) uni sushi ( $ 5/2PCS)- SUPER fresh and not available during off season service can be kinda slow at times and staff tend to be loud when the restaurant is empty and ive seen the kitchen staff sitting next to us eating their meals however, like one of the previous yelper said the chirashi keeps me coming back for more. parking is the worst part about going to this restaurant.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
