<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 53' %><h2>broth<br />occurrence: 130</h2><div><ol><li>The waitress realized that we were sharing that noodle soup, not only she got us an extra bowl ... she have the extra bowl filled with the broth!</li><li>The broth in the mandu soup was definitely more tasty than before and less salty.</li><li>The broth was n't that impressive and it did n't have much taste to it.</li><li>Neither of which was impressive enough to compensate for the atmosphere, the noddles are indeed tasty and have nice slurpiness factor, but the broth of both soups was lacking in flavor or better say brothiness, that 's right, it felt more like hot water than a beef broth.</li><li>We make mussels at home all the time but will still order them at Chez Laurent because the broth is 10X better.</li><li>The first thing I did is take a sip of the soup and the broth tasted very good was actually very impressed with the soup broth. it was definitely very good and the portions for good had a lot of meat and I strongly recommend that anybody that 's in that area to make their way to this restaurant because it was a pleasant surprise.</li><li>The broth is light and refreshing, definitely tasted natural ( msg free).</li><li>Our soup came with a whole tiny chicken which was fall off the bone tender, the broth had some subtle flavours from the ginseng and dates, nothing overwhelming but in a word `` soul-satisfying.''</li><li>The broth was quite sweet, so season it accordingly.</li><li>The chicken soup had about half a chicken and the broth was really clean and light in flavouring.</li><li>Hot &amp; Sour soup was quite peppery, but the broth itself was tasted kinda stale and overcooked.</li><li>Anybody that eats Pho understands that the star of the dish is the broth.</li><li>The broth typically is made for hours and sometimes days and at the end you have this you have an tasty broth.</li><li>The broth typically is made for hours and sometimes days and at the end you have this you have an tasty broth.</li><li>The broth was bland, boring and not a Pho broth.</li><li>Delicious broth, not too oily or over done, big portions, and good price.</li><li>My main complain is the broth, it is missing the flavor and is very dark, which means they do not parboil or roast the bones first and do not remove the scum in the final cooking, steps I would never miss when cooking at home, they help remove impurities and make broth crystal clean.</li><li>Their broth is tasty and their pho is well cooked.</li><li>The small size was soooo big I almost could n't finish it, but then I am a twenty-something Asian, might have something to do with it: P I did n't want the rare beef so they gave me more brisket, the broth did have a hint of MSG, but show me a pho place that does n't nowadays!</li><li>The broth is full of flavour.</li><li>The broth here is amazing the meat is a nice texture I love when you take get take out how they separate in bag it all the only problem is the meat comes frozen so when you put it in your boss when you get home its like ice cold so you always have to warm up to meet separately and reheat your bra overall they 're pretty good unfortunately they only accept cash.</li><li>The broth was flavourful, and had a good amount of beef and tendons.</li><li>Do n't get me wrong, it 's good and flavourful but because the broth is so good I have a feeling MSG or something is used.</li><li>The broth is well balanced, flavourful, and fresh.</li><li>Pho broth was flavorful, low sodium and nice and hot when it came out!</li><li>The broth is tasty and they give you a very good amount of noodles and beef.</li><li>The broth is perfect .. just perfect.</li><li>I got a large bowl of special beef noodles, and the broth was really tasty and the portions of meat were huge!</li><li>The broth had a great flavour.</li><li>This one is the closest, the broth not quiet as good, not gingery enough, but the deep fried tofu batter was almost parallel, frail, the fragile stringy bits a little gooey ( how I like them)!</li><li>Delicious, delicious broth.</li><li>- Banana cooked in liquor and covered in chantilly cream on the side round off the dessert with different texture and elements We also ordered Steamed Mussel ( $ 10)- The broth is so so so good ... enough flavour to just compliment the freshness of the mussels ....</li><li>The broth is made to perfection and you spend about 2 minutes waiting after you order.</li><li>The broth is not overtly saltly.</li><li>The flavour of the pho is so tasteful and vibrant because of all the mint leaves and the broth.</li><li>The broth was good, the noodles seemed fresh, meat portion was decent. good sign What lacked was the portion sizes were smaller than the typical Pho restaurant and side dishes.</li><li>The broth was very nice but the chicken had slimy pieces of skin on it which do n't look appetizing and do n't have a texture I like.</li><li>I usually get a Pho Dac Biet, which has a little bit of everything thrown in a very tasty broth.</li><li>I find the broth is usually better on the weekend, rather than what you get on a slower weekday.</li><li>Whatever variety of pho you get, the broth is outstanding.</li><li>The broth is excellent, the noodles are not bad, pretty consistent, never undercooked or overcooked.</li><li>The broth was very flavorful and not salty.</li><li>The buckwheat noodles cooked in the broth was even better, but the congee cooked in the remaining liquid was the star of the show for me.</li><li>The udon was massive and had a nice broth.</li><li>The broth was a chicken broth and tasted ok.</li><li>However, my dad liked his pho and said the broth was delicious and had that true authentic pho taste.</li><li>What I like:- The broth: I find that most of pho broth are bit too salty. after I had my pho I need to drink lots of water.</li><li>The broth was different than regular pork bone, it was kind of like Campbells cream of mushroom done Korean style.</li><li>Braised Beef Noodle Soup ( $ 6.99) Again, delicious broth and noodles.</li><li>The broth was superb and had the perfect amount of seasoning to go along with a large portion of noodles as well.</li><li>Pho is delicious, the broth is perfect and a variety of sizes depending on how hungry you are.</li><li>Their broth is alright.</li><li>The broth and meat is very good.</li><li>The broth was savoury with a hint of sweetness and spice.</li><li>The broth did n't taste anything special, and I was n't able to really taste the `` sour'' ness until around halfway thru my meal.</li><li>Like most of its kind, the broth tastes primarily of salt and soy and msg.</li><li>The broth was a bit on the salty side, but other wise perfect, with large pieces of meltingly soft tofu as well as seafood and pork.</li><li>- The broth has this really light delicate taste and with tons of clams!</li><li>The broth smelled incredible but the soup was n't nearly as spicy as it looked.</li><li>The broth was so good with all the seafood juices and tomato sauce.</li><li>It 's not the best PHO I 've ever eaten but its a good PHO, the broth is pretty good, the sizes and pricing is solid too.</li><li>I requested extra spicy and fresh chili pepper were used and the broth was really coconuty ...</li><li>Rare beef and tendon pho, it was a pretty decent broth considering its a Chinese viet restaurant.</li><li>But what really puts this place over the top is the broth.</li><li>The broth was alright but the noodle wasnt the authentic type, it was the dried kind which was thicker and not as soft to eat.</li><li>Too much stuff in the broth- tons of giant chunks of black mushroom, tons of squiggly egg bits.</li><li>Though the noodles did n't absorb the broth too well and tasted pretty bland.</li><li>It was decent as I think the broth was lacking flavour.</li><li>PLus the soup is just very bland broth.</li><li>Their tom yum broth is amazing.</li><li>I think they put a lot of chili oil into the broth, so it makes it hard to drink it.</li><li>After having drank a spoonful of broth we resorted to just eating the noodles and the beef ( without drinking the broth) but because of how salty the broth was, they just tasted like salty noodles and salty beef.</li><li>Incredible homemade noodles, and delicious broth.</li><li>However, the broth was very salty, or `` too flavorful'' in a nice way, that I chugged at least 5 liters of water in the next 3 hours ...</li><li>Did n't expect it because the broth was white in colour but there was so much pepper put it, my friend did n't expect that it would be spicy judging from the description and looks in the menu.</li><li>It was my first time trying it yet I fell in love with the broth instantly, it came in a generous portion and all the lunch specials came with Korean black rice ( or purple rather) and ban chan ( side dishes).</li><li>The broth for the pho is always very tasty, not watered down or filled with MSG like a lot of other restaurants.</li><li>The broth tastes delicious and they have a generous serving of beef.</li><li>The broth is very fresh and has a nice kick to it.</li><li>The broth was hot enough as well.</li><li>While the broth still flavourful, the sausage did n't taste fresh at all.</li><li>I thought the broth was OK but lacked depth.</li><li>Love their broth.</li><li>The tofu was silky, as it should be, and the broth was flavourful.</li><li>The broth was great and the tofu was just enough this time ( use to be overflowing).</li><li>My favourite is the Bulgogi soup which contains a yummy broth that has the right amount of sweetness and clear jap chae noodles that has an amazing texture, served with the usual obligatory Korean side dishes and purple rice.</li><li>$ 8 for a soup, with your choice of filling + tofu, served with a stone-pot purple rice which also doubles up as a second soup to cleanse off your palette after chowing down the hot, tasty broth.</li><li>The broth had a great spicy kick with some depth added by the veggies in it.</li><li>The broth was so good; it basically tasted like the ocean.</li><li>The broth for the soon tofu was very flavourful and the purple rice is delicious!</li><li>I only deducted 0.5 because the soup is sometimes on the salty side and the eggs they give you are extra tiny! `` everyone knows, when you go to Buk Chang 's, it 's for the soon tofu. unless you have a serious aversion to the texture of silk, do as the locals do and order one of the gloriously smooth tofu soups. they are THE BEST in the city! although, soon tofu is sometimes referred to as stew, it 's more like a light, flavourful broth with pieces of vegetables, tofu, and sometimes meat. it 's served piping hot, and in my opinion, best eaten in the colder months. hints: parking is in the back alley nearby subway is finch station, head south 2 blocks see jimi 's review of the toronto location at: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/buk-chang-dong-soon-tofu-toronto.</li><li>Great broth and toothsome tofu!</li><li>I always get the beef dumpling tofu soup as I find it makes for the tastiest broth.</li><li>The dumpling soon tofu soup was ok except it had a grand total of 2 dumplings and the rest was pretty much a mixture of tofu and broth.</li><li>The broth is excellent, and the tofu is clean and tender.</li><li>I 've had much seafood soon tofu soup at innumerable Korean restaurants but none stands out quite like this one; their broth is very aromatic with the kick of heat.</li><li>Meat is very similar in quality as all the other korean placea in gta but the broth is a little more tasty LA beef ribs.</li><li>The broth, I could taste the MSG, so I did n't drink.</li><li>The meat is so tender it 's legitimately falling off the bone and the broth was n't too salty.</li><li>Pork bone soup is definitely the fan favourite and it is very tasty, the broth is flavourful.</li><li>Nice and tender, and the broth is delicious.</li><li>The broth is very good but not at all spicy.</li><li>The broth was just OK though and if there was to be any meat, it sure did n't come in this one ...</li><li>The broth was good so I might try their pho next time but doubt I will come back.</li><li>What makes their pho so great is the broth.</li><li>The broth is pristine, not overly salty and balances well with the noodles they use.</li><li>The portions are truly generous, there is a lot of meat, and the broth is very flavorful.</li><li>With this dish, we always tell them that we want the hand-made noodles because they taste so much better with the broth.</li><li>The broth I found pretty salty, perhaps over-msg 'd ?</li><li>The soup itself was pretty good; the broth was a bit too salty but did have a spicy kick that led to some sweaty yelpers.</li><li>One thing I noticed was that the broth was a little on the salty side.</li><li>The main negative here is the broth.</li><li>This place would easily be a go to for me if not for the broth.</li><li>Good amount of meat and the broth was delicious.</li><li>The broth was incredible ... rich with flavour.</li><li>- RAMEN- the broth was like MILK it was soo richly stewed. this came, perhaps thankfully, towards the end and I could barely finish it all.</li><li>I also tried their soon tofu and pork bone soup, love their broth! !!</li><li>The spicy noodles are just overly spicy over powering the taste with just the spices and does n't enhance the flavour of the noodles and broth.</li><li>Portion size is generous, noodles are tender without being mushy and the broth is savoury.</li><li>The broth was excellent.</li><li>It 's a complex broth that has hints of seafood, pork, and msg.</li><li>They get the job done but they do n't compliment the broth when the broth is good.</li><li>They get the job done but they do n't compliment the broth when the broth is good.</li><li>It says that the wait is long and broth is bland.</li><li>Despite the spiciness, the broth was good and flavourful.</li><li>The noodles always come out at the right consistency and the broth, though not as excellent as when Kenzo first started out, is still very good.</li><li>The broth at all places were are all pretty good and tasted as described.</li><li>My take, Look- the broth is salt flavoured soup, with a hint of soy .. a good neutral stock. the yellow egg based noodles are just slightly bigger than the wavy noodles ones has in an instant noodle package.</li><li>Yummy broth, great noodles, and aweeeesome pork.</li><li>The seafood ramen- noodles were clumped together, shrimps and squid were not fresh, broth was just mediocre.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
