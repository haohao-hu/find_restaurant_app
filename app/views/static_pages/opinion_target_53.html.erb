<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 53' %><h2>coffee<br />occurrence: 143</h2><div><ol><li>The coffee has this robust &amp; flavorful taste and aroma.</li><li>This was like every other cafe in Miami with matriarch figures brewing coffee and all.</li><li>You would also know that it 's decent but not great coffee and just decent food that 's only suitable as a filler.</li><li>The owner sometimes will have fresh baked cake which tastes great with coffee.</li><li>The coffee was somewhat weak, and the Mediterranean omelette I ordered was decent but otherwise very ho-hum.</li><li>Same mediocre overpriced coffee and sweets.</li><li>I love second cup coffee specially the flavored once.</li><li>The only reason I 'm giving this place a 3 star is because of the relatively healthy food options they have Their coffee is alright for a change, but I still prefer Starbucks Americano.</li><li>CAFE:- no cafe menu, only one type of coffee ( I never order it, so I do n't know what it is)- there 's no wifi, no need to fight for power outlets ... since there are n't any,:)- the lounge tables are super spacious and comfy, tables are large, great for all sorts of work, from textbooks, tax forms, to picture gallery work- mostly quiet environment, unless we 're talking busy meal times RESTO:- yes, decor 's a little ' unique', think rustic cottage- washroom 's a little cramped- they regularly accommodate for large tables, work with you to come up with a customized menu- large room in the back if you want privacy as well- food is done well.</li><li>Coffee was fine.</li><li>There are times when the lines are pretty large however and sometimes it 's quicker to park and go inside to get your coffee.</li><li>Friendly service with a smile, fresh coffee ( on my dark roast black), display full of selections of food.</li><li>I can definitely see myself visiting Tim Hortons regularly for a quick bite and coffee.</li><li>I would get one coffee a day, and 3/5 times it would be wrong.</li><li>Hands me the coffee and looks away.</li><li>But not offering a free coffee or a discount on the entree.</li><li>Only reason I gave it 2 stars was cuz the coffee was quite nice.</li><li>My last trip to this store found me full of surprise when I saw the one type of coffee, which I love and have shipped from Europe, sitting on the display shelf behind the counter.</li><li>Almost ready to pay, the fat owner comes out from the back and sees the friendly girl who served my about to ring up this fantastic coffee ( did I mention I love it ?).</li><li>Well, my coffee is now readily available in almost every supermarket so greasy slim can change his prices all he wants!</li><li>The fruit was really fresh, and the coffee is bottomless !!</li><li>Ok, the bagel and coffee were OK.</li><li>The Coffee was pretty good for a diner too--not watered down.</li><li>I love their coffee too, sometimes I buy their coffee beans for home.</li><li>I ended up drinking coffee.</li><li>The waitress took our order when we were ready but forgot about the coffee and water, it was n't busy and everyone makes mistakes, but we had to order a second time.</li><li>The coffee was probably average to below average in strength and taste.</li><li>Today I ordered a large coffee with two sweeteners.</li><li>I had to put a large coffee ( from another place) in it and then it kind of balanced out the taste.</li><li>I do n't see a difference between Tim Hortons or McD 's in terms of quality, so now getting a cheap coffee is just a matter of convenience, unless you want to pay extra for the ambiance of a Starbucks or local hip cafe.</li><li>Mon- Fri, this is my go to place for coffee.</li><li>Their coffee- it 's always the same!</li><li>And for some that wants to do Korean girl watching .. you will be the only male that be drinking coffee from a pink flowery cup in there.</li><li>Honestly I felt the coffee was average and my friend and I received them in takeout cups.</li><li>That might be understandable if they had some amazing coffee but they do n't.</li><li>And I also usually order the viet coffee too.</li><li>Excellent coffee- but no decaf.</li><li>The coffee ( $ 1.90) was delicious as Vietnamese coffee always is.</li><li>The manager should have been polite, he should have apologized for the mistake made by whoever took the telephone reservation, and he should have offered a complimentary coffee!</li><li>The only part that was satisfactory were the drinks and coffee.</li><li>I guess they do n't have any dessert, coffee or tea because we were never offered.</li><li>Self serve on the coffee or drinks and grab a friend or a table and enjoy.</li><li>The coffee was too bland for us, the cappuccinos seemed to be the favourite, but for me the espresso was the highlight.</li><li>And we all loved the little Amaretti cookies that were served with coffee.</li><li>Mango milkshake or viet coffee to close.</li><li>Here 's the definition of a Caffe Americano off the Starbucks website: In Europe, coffee is essentially espresso- which, in America, is n't very much coffee.</li><li>Everytime I come here the line ups are long and it doesnt fare well for the quick coffee grab.</li><li>Guess correctly and win a free coffee!</li><li>At peak times, you 're not likely to find a place to sit so this place is more suited for ordering your coffee and then taking it out with you.</li><li>I had a coffee with my pizza ..... coffee was very good ................ better than MOST other places.</li><li>One day i wanted to grab a coffee and work on my laptop elegantly at mcd ... i realized their WiFi never works.:/ yikes.</li><li>No more water, no one came by to see if we wanted another coffee.</li><li>Food was decent, coffee was terrible but overall good value for the money.</li><li>All the main dishes come with a free drink ( hot tea, hot lemon tea, coffee or coffee-tea with milk) Cafe Arc de Triomphe is a fine place to get a quick fill when you are too lazy to cook or just do n't want to bother with ritual and fancier fare.</li><li>I orderd mini steak, 2 eggs, toast, 1 hash brown, and a coffee.</li><li>We were here after having lunch at Inakaya and wanting to have some desserts and coffee.</li><li>Watery coffee.</li><li>Coffee was bland and lukewarm.</li><li>Right across from Cummer Park (* cough cough* ... phrasing ...), convenient in-and-out, friendly staff, good cheap coffee.</li><li>Oh, triple venti, 180F, soy, half caf, half decaf, Latte with two and a half Splendas, shot of vanilla, dash of cinnamon at Starbucks sounds pretty wimpy compared to a regular coffee at TH 's!</li><li>On several trips to Toronto, I have had coffee at this particular Tim Horton 's ( as well as a couple of others) and I have to say my verdict: Its just pretty good.</li><li>Noon on a Saturday- line not too long, ordered simple short regular coffee and it came quickly, tasted great as always.</li><li>Great service, great coffee ( maybe not* the* best, but consistently an 8 out of 10, in contrast with Tim 's, which ranges from 2/10 to 8/10 depending on the day, humidity, planetary alignment, and other unknown factors) ..</li><li>The coffee, coleslaw and cheesecake are fine without standing out.</li><li>For dessert, you ca n't go wrong with baklava and armenian coffee, a perfect ending to a perfect Armenian meal!</li><li>The coffee is like espresso-tar, but really delicious and highly caffeinated.</li><li>Bottomless coffee.</li><li>Coffee was great !!</li><li>I ordered mine with a small glass of fresh-pressed orange juice plus an extra side of hollandaise ( y' know, as a shooter, the way normal people do- heh heh) and the asked for regular bacon and a coffee.</li><li>Coffee is light and mild- usual diner style.</li><li>The food, coffee, and service were adequate for the money, but seated at the back with so many people packed in I ca n't say it was exactly pleasant.</li><li>The eggs, home fries, toast and coffee were all about average for a diner, but by a few accounts, the bacon was superb.</li><li>A nice place to go a grab a coffee and sit and read on a late night walk.</li><li>My brother ordered a set meal that came with daily soup or salad, drink ( my grandfather 's coffee), entree, and dessert.</li><li>It is a small cafe that serves desserts like waffle, crepes, sundaes, cake and specialty coffee.</li><li>5- 5 Tables 4- 4 Chairs per Table 3- Afternoon Coffee Hour ( 3 pm) 2- Double Cappuccino ( $ 3.59) 1- Shortcake Crepe ( $ 7.99) Question.</li><li>I came here with my friend who wanted to just hang out and have a coffee.</li><li>I probably wo n't be back again since I ca n't have 99% of what 's on the menu, but I was pleased that the coffee and limonata came to $ 4 after tax, which is much less than I expected from such a nice place.</li><li>We came here and sat down for a little bit and had their cappuccino and coffee.</li><li>However, the cakes I had yesterday ( coffee flavoured and crème brûlée) was awful.</li><li>Okay, the coffee one was decent when comparing it to crème brûlée.</li><li>The crepes and waffles are always beautifully presented, and their coffee is up to par.</li><li>The only thing I did n't like was their flavoured coffee, which strikes no particular significance to me, the flavours are quite mild and sometimes hard to tell if you 're really drinking the flavour you ordered.</li><li>Located in North York in the Yonge/Finch area, this place is a great joint to have coffee and dessert.</li><li>Coffee was so so.</li><li>Their coffee is not properly tamped and therefore very inconsistent with taste and weak. ( esp during rush hours!)</li><li>Visited here on November 21 for crepes and coffee.</li><li>I had the Ham crepe, with an Americano, and both the crepe and coffee were delicious.</li><li>A hot, bitter coffee compliments this sweet dessert.</li><li>Great place for an afternoon coffee or brunch.</li><li>Getting a chocolate croissant and coffee here is my morning ritual.</li><li>The last three times I 've gone in and the coffee has n't been ready at breakfast time.</li><li>Is it normal to not be able to order a large coffee in an extra large cup so that we could add some ice in it to cool it down ?</li><li>Wonderful service, great potions and good coffee!</li><li>The coffee is good.</li><li>The coffee was re-filled often and this was a nice surprise given how busy the place was.</li><li>Loved their coffee.</li><li>The coffee is good, too.</li><li>The service was great, they always made sure we had enough coffee, which was n't bad as well, a lot better than what I expected it to be coming from a diner.</li><li>Coffee tasted mediocre but it was n't burnt or anything.</li><li>The bill came to $ 18 with coffee, so a little more than other similar places I have been, and $ 2.50 for the coffee is more than most.</li><li>The bill came to $ 18 with coffee, so a little more than other similar places I have been, and $ 2.50 for the coffee is more than most.</li><li>I had my typical `` breakfast special'', eggs over easy, home fries, toast and coffee ( which was a notch above average ... not great, but not bad).</li><li>Again, I am no expert, but the coffee was really good.</li><li>The coffee is what I 'd call `` Italian cafe'' meaning it 's better and more authentic than Starbucks but not as good as a true indie coffee shop.</li><li>It 's an A-okay place for breakfast/ brunch, because the pastries and coffee are decent and the swing chairs add a nice weekend fun touch.</li><li>I recently was dragged here with a friend because it was the only place open for a late night coffee.</li><li>I decided to skip that and just go for a plain reg. coffee.</li><li>Then off to get a coffee.</li><li>There was a sign saying at this time you could get a coffee and a muffin for 2.79.</li><li>Apparently you have to ask for them to come as the `` coffee and a muffin'' special.</li><li>- The only possible reason to go there is to get the coffee and muffin for $ 1.98 deal, sit at the best seat ( whichever that is) for hours on end, drinking the free serve yourself water ( with a new cup each time), and choke the free wi-fi torrenting movies ... ( yet to try all this but its on my list).</li><li>The coffee was not drip coffee.</li><li>They also have good baked goods and coffee if you 're on the run.</li><li>The coffee is pretty good too.</li><li>Rows of low contemporary couches and cozy table settings fill this multilevel cafe and lend for a casual environment, where one can grab a coffee or a full entree.</li><li>Had the tuna salad which was enough for 3 ppl but I was there with a pal before a movie ( hey park underground, cinema validates parking m-f after 5:00 p.m.) coffee 's look good, all day breakfast.</li><li>Filling up coffee.</li><li>Sure, the coffee is n't the greatest in the world, but it 's a diner- what do you expect ?</li><li>Ordered: Coffee, Ice Water, Coke, Bacon &amp; Eggs, Ceasar Salad, Grilled Cheese with Ham, Fries with Gravy The coffee was disgusting, water did not come with any Ice ( even though I specifically asked), but the Coke came with a glass full of ice, go figure ?</li><li>Food arrived hot and fast ( I 'm the only 1 there, so ymmv) My server got me a coffee immediately, asked numerous times about my dining experience brought refills ...</li><li>We ordered regular coffee, Ben Ham ( 2), and Jo Construction.</li><li>It 's almost offensive to pay that much for coffee when other breakfast places include it in the cost of the meal.</li><li>In-store experiences are good, since it 's nice to eat dinner while watching Filipino TV channels and having free coffee or water.</li><li>It 's clean, there 's a good number of available booths and tables, the food is fresh ( at least on Saturday morning it is) and you get free coffee if you dine in.</li><li>This is the same time we find out that they charged us for the coffee.</li><li>The only one that seemed promising was the Symposium and the list of dessert and coffee sounded good.</li><li>My waiter was nice enough to cover the lattes as a free coffee!</li><li>Enjoyed coffee and some cake end I enjoyed.</li><li>A few things happened that made me questions the professionalism of the staff: 1) The mug my coffee was served in looked like it have been rubbed against the hood fan in the kitchen before being served.</li><li>Great new spot in my hood with such warm ambiance great for families or friends for dinner, coffee, dessert or all of the above.</li><li>At first, Symposium Café gave off the '' coffee and tea '' vibe and then you dine in and their menu is like 50 lbs heavy.</li><li>Our coffee was just brewed and was a good cup of joe.</li><li>Had to walk up to the counter to get our coffee.</li><li>Great dessert and coffee.</li><li>The last serving of food put on our table was around 11:30pm or midnight, after which you have dessert, fruit and coffee.</li><li>One of us ordered a large salad and had coffee.</li><li>Something in this food is not agreeing with us, the one common denominator we shared was having their coffee with the 10% milk.</li><li>The Highlights:- This place is gorgeous both inside and out- Ample amount of seating for both small and big groups- The waiters are all very professional and seasoned in the food serving business ( you wo n't find your neighbor 's 16 year old kid working here)- Free hors d' oeuvres at the start of your meal ( pickles, olives, cottage cheese, and garlic bread)- Reasonable prices ( all main entrees come with a salad or soup of the day ... a good amount too)- Parking is a plenty and free- Desserts are made on site and delicious ... and you can get it for a low price- Bottomless coffee for $ 1.75- Quiet so you can carry on a conversation with your dining companions I will definitely be back.</li><li>When it came a waiter said that as well as coffee, all of our `` aperitifs'' were on the house.</li><li>Good coffee!</li><li>$ 10 for 3 eggs, bacon, home fries, toast and coffee.</li><li>The total was only $ 13 with coffee.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
