The Joons Original Spicy Sauce)* $ 9.25 per portion ( 2 portions minimum), we ordered 3 portions for 3 people* Extra Add On: rice cake, mozzarella cheese, instant noodle, vegetables and fried rice* Extra add ons are all $ 2 except the fried rice* Everything is thrown together and comes to your table uncooked* Because it 's chicken, they take a while to fully cook and it drives you crazy* Servers will come around and cook them for you so do n't worry about the process* If you order mozarella cheese, they come midway and add it on near the end* For 3 portion order, I found there were n't much chicken* Original spicy sauce is not spicy at all !!</li><li>Mediocre food, portions were smaller than usually, u have to add cheese, ramen and rice cake, do n't bother getting the rice add ones We waited 30mins for our food to come and they would n't give us our side dishes until our meal came ......</li><li>We did n't order rice cake, but it came with it too, not sure if there 's any to start off with.</li><li>I also loved the chicken and chewy rice cake.</li><li>You have to pay $ 2.00 extra for each topping you want added ( ie. rice cake, mozzarella cheese, rice, noodles).</li><li>If you are eating solely Dak Gal Bee only: 1 Hungry Patron = 2-portions 2 Hungry Patrons = 3-portions Another option is add ALL the add-ons ( Rice Cake, Noodle, etc ...) which would total about the same price as an individual Dak Gal Bee portion.</li><li>I got the cheese, rice cake, fish cake, veggies and extra ramen for this ramen dish and it was shared among two people.</li><li>When I first visited Joons on Yonge and on Bloor St for its Dak Galbi 10 + years ago, we used to order 2 portions for 2 people with some add-ons like rice cake or instant noodles and that would be pretty filling.</li><li>You 'll probably need to top it off with some extras like rice cake, ramen, or rice.</li><li>I wish they were more generous with the toppings as it seems like I could always eat more of the ramen or rice cake.</li><li>For the three of us, it came close to $ 18/person, so not really the best value. been going there since it opened on yonge. love their Dak Gal Bee ( table cooking of spicy chicken with veggies) do n't forget to add rice cake, yam n double cheese !!</li><li>Came here with the wife today and ordered the chicken and seafood along with rice cake, noodle and mozzarella.</li><li>4. twice cooked pork with rice cake: AMAZING.</li><li>You can find all your traditional and fan favourites like pork bone soup, bibimbap, and rice cake.</li><li>Spicy and sweet level was JUST right and the chewiness of the rice cake ... wow.</li><li>Try the rice cake: it 's sliced rice tubes with cabbage and protein, and while looks may be deceiving, this dish was really pleasant.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
