<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 115' %><h2>bill<br />occurrence: 48</h2><div><ol><li>After waiting again, we walked through the restaurant to find the waitress to request the bill.</li><li>Dropped a $ 10 and walked off completely satisfied with the fact that I had fed my gf and I with one bill.</li><li>Staff is friendly and they 're great about splitting the bill.</li><li>Service was fairly good but when we were almost finish eating, all the employees were also eating their lunch and it took some time to get the bill.</li><li>When trying to leave ( we left about an hour after the game, so it was pretty empty) it took about half an hour to get the bill.</li><li>Overall service was really bad, we had to call another waitress to get our bill.</li><li>I would come here for the drinks next time because they 're very reasonably priced: Amaretto Sour- $ 4.86 Gin and Tonic- $ 4.86 I did NOT like that there was a mandatory 15% gratuity charged on our bill.</li><li>Also the waitress took away our service button once we ordered so there was no way for us to get their attention for water or get out bill.</li><li>It took quite a while to get another server to attend to us and finally get us our bill.</li><li>The bill took a long time in coming .... longer than it took for the food to arrive ...</li><li>When the waitress brought us the bill she forgot the 15% coupon, but she apologized politely and corrected the mistake.</li><li>Nandos has the same ordering system and it has over 1000 restaurants in over 30 countries. ( it obviously works) I prefer ordering this way, no waiting for the bill when your ready to leave you.</li><li>This place gets packed quite early with young Koreans, probably York students, Also it 's Korean table service rules which means it 's not considered impolite to flag down your waitress when you want service or the bill.</li><li>The portions are BIG, just the way I like it, and the bill was pretty decent- I think for all that between 5 people we paid around $ 65.</li><li>Took 30 minutes to get the bill.</li><li>The manager then told us that if we did n't need anything else, that he would get our bill and asked if we were paying by card, basically ushering us out.</li><li>- Server was nice and knew his stuff, but having to look for him just to get the bill was kind of ... annoying.</li><li>Everything on the menu was decently priced ( our bill was under $ 20 for two people), and the service was attentive enough.</li><li>I wish we had a ringer in the booth we were sitting in because it was hard to flag down our server to get the bill.</li><li>Also a note, do n't order any drink that needs to be made ( Ovaltine, Horlicks, smoothie, etc) unless you feel like receiving it AFTER you get the bill.</li><li>They tacked a standard 15% gratuity on our bill, which they did n't deserve.</li><li>We walked up to the counter to pay after waiting half an hour for him to show up and bring us our bill.</li><li>It also took us a really long time to get the bill.</li><li>So we just simply got fed up after a while of waiting and decided to get the bill.</li><li>Nothing too special overall ... prices were fair i suppose but make sure you check your bill- they calculated my bill wrong twice and then after finally getting the bill right, they gave me back way less change than what it should 've been ... if they had n't do n't that I would 've given them 3 stars If you are looking for a place for the family to go to for a dinner out with decent food at reasonable prices, this would be a good choice.</li><li>Although I think I was charged more because maybe I was foreign since I was charged $ 15.75 ( tax included) but the lunch menu said it was $ 11-12.99 ish, so make sure you check the bill.</li><li>Long story short: Service took a long time, one of the girls acknowledged my raised hand but never came back to help me get the bill.</li><li>My friend paid with credit card, and our server was more than happy to entertain my request to break a $ 50 bill.</li><li>We even had a different waitress bring our bill because the sorry-ass waitress that took our order did n't even bother to come back.</li><li>They finally took our order, rolled their eyes at the baby again and then never returned except to give us the bill.</li><li>We sat waiting after we finished our meal, even going as far as stacking our plates to indicate we had long since finished when we realized they likely were n't going to be bringing us our bill and time soon and we would have to go to the front to pay.</li><li>One of these quirks include the fact that they do not allow you to split the bill ( one bill per table) and I 'm not sure why this is the case.</li><li>Took a while to get the servers attention when we wanted to get a refill or the bill.</li><li>They 've also implemented a table service system with a tabletop device with buttons indicating if you need service, want to order, or want the bill.</li><li>It took us a while to get our bill, and the staff apologized for the wait.</li><li>Large portions, small bill, that fits me just fine.</li><li>When we finished our meals, it also took forever and a day to get our bill.</li><li>They did not even come to us at the table to give us the bill.</li><li>The bill was paid and the chef came out and had words with the party that paid our bill.</li><li>The bill was paid and the chef came out and had words with the party that paid our bill.</li><li>Orders that never came and we waited for 20 minutes just to get the bill.</li><li>-Sometimes it takes forever to get the bill.</li><li>We waited very long to get our food, very long to get coffee refills, and very long to get our bill.</li><li>- Biggest pet peeve: waited 10 minutes to get the bill, then even longer to pay.</li><li>At that point I just told him to get us our bill because we were in no mood for eating after this treatment and I was n't going to pay for the food they took away from us and that we did n't eat.</li><li>But I 'm the end when it came to getting the bill.</li><li>We were so pissed, we left them $ 96 on a $ 95.89 bill and left with the waitresses eyes glaring at us in disbelief.</li><li>We had to flag him down to get the bill.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
