<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 120' %><h2>taste<br />occurrence: 56</h2><div><ol><li>The portions are fair, but the taste could use some work and the prices are a little high.</li><li>2. the waitress was nice 3. lemongrass shrimp: vegetables are very fresh and crispy, shrimps were fat and chewy 4. friend had curry beef which i found too milky taste.</li><li>Everyone was very satisfied with the food, quality and taste.</li><li>They are store bought so the taste is pretty generic and awful.</li><li>Definitely seemed like the used too much sesame oil and it just drowns out the taste.</li><li>Must try the sushi pizza, very unique taste.</li><li>Fresh and homemade taste.</li><li>There is salt provided to adjust the taste needed.</li><li>Hot and sour soup: Taste is acceptable, but is plain watery.</li><li>Singhapore noodle: Taste is acceptable but again oily.</li><li>I had to put a large coffee ( from another place) in it and then it kind of balanced out the taste.</li><li>This is an OK Pho place, it 's not authentic Pho, I think even on one occasion they admitted it 's not authentic Vietnamese so the taste might be different, lol what ?</li><li>There are a lot of ways to make good tasting Chinese food by using garnish, sauces to give it a more complex taste.</li><li>It could be a little too sweet for some folks, but it has a quite unique taste.</li><li>Quaker or Chicha are most common and have an authentic taste that you ca n't find anywhere in north American cuisine or beverages for that matter.</li><li>The Nova Scotia Lobster was so succulent and delicious with a nice buttery taste.</li><li>I know there are cheaper shawarma places out there but they do n't produce the same taste.</li><li>Did I mention most of the black bean sauce trickled on to my crispy chicken alternating the taste.</li><li>Jerk Chicken on Coco bread with cole slaw if you just want a taste.</li><li>Hubby likes the zataar though I do n't enjoy the taste.</li><li>Great food with that home-cooked taste and served fast at a decent price!</li><li>The meals are huge and have enough taste, tortillas are fresh ..</li><li>I could tell they are using some pork broth because the flavour tastes more like pork than chicken which is a bit overwhelming when I wanted a cleaner not so rich taste.</li><li>Presentation of food is good, but the taste is just okay.</li><li>Taste is alright.</li><li>All in all we 'll go back for the good price and good taste.</li><li>However, this place 's broth has the right amount of taste.</li><li>I really do n't like pizza, but they put some kind of spice on theirs that really gives it a unique and nice taste.</li><li>The pizza is good with wonderful taste.</li><li>I ca n't vouch for the authenticity of this place but the taste was excellent and there seemed to be a lot of Caribbean folks in line so that speaks volumes.</li><li>I 'm usually not a fan of pad thai but this one did n't have any ketchup which vastly improved the taste.</li><li>Taste is n't that great either, I would prefer food court Chinese food over this place any day.</li><li>Reasonably priced drinks with very authentic taste.</li><li>Great value but even better is the great taste.</li><li>Family style korean restaurant with a fairly standard food selection, large portions and good taste.</li><li>Although it was not what I was expecting because it was more of a modern taste.</li><li>I might passed on that as the tea was kind of lukewarm and lack the taste.</li><li>Friendly neighbourhood joint that always delivers with authentic taste.</li><li>Overall the rice, noodle, dumpling, and bread-like dishes are very much Chinese style, but it does differ a little from mainstream Chinese cooking just to have its own unique taste.</li><li>I have been here several times with friends and we order the same thing because we love the taste.</li><li>Their sashimi did not taste fresh, tuna seemed light yellow in colour and the salmon did not have an oily complexion or buttery taste.</li><li>It enhances the taste tremendously, and enhances our entire experience.</li><li>The food was really good only thing was the pork bun was a little oily but had great taste.</li><li>And the taste is just like that which I get in China!</li><li>Off the bat I was blown away by the combination of taste, portion and price.</li><li>Lots of food, but not the best taste.</li><li>I feel like the green tea icecream was so good, it was n't like the typical store brought gt icecream cause it was n't as creamy and i liked how it had the bitterness of the tea which really gave it that homemade taste.</li><li>Taste is a bit bland.</li><li>Incredible value and authentic taste.</li><li>What we had: Kimchi soup, dumpling soup, and vegetable soup ( all soups come with a bowl of purple rice and shared side dishes) Taste: 6/10 They give you a little raw egg to crack into your soup, which is a nice touch.</li><li>Quantity was not the issue- it was the taste.</li><li>It 's a perfect casual spot to bring friends or family out of town for a bite to eat or to impress your date/colleagues with your great taste in food:) They will thank you, although ... their waistlines may not.</li><li>I 'm not sure if it was the bun or the actual burger, but it had a definite freezer-like taste.</li><li>Taste is not authentic, however, it is rather unique and delicious.</li><li>So I took a few more bites and my mom even tried it, agreeing that it had a mouldy taste.</li><li>Aroma- breathe in the salt and seaweed, you can readily exfoliate your face with the steam.:) Taste- noodles cooked with the right amount of chewiness, it soaks the flavours of the soup base nicely, beef was ample, it was very tender in the soup, the half egg cooked about right and not over done.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
