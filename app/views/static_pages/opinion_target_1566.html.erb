<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1566' %><h2>gyro<br />occurrence: 2</h2><div><ol><li>I have been at this place for past few days and simply its the worst experience. the first day I got my gyro order on toasted white bread with no sauce or any other form of toppings !! when I complained to server and ask if I coukd see the manager `` I was told that there is no manager at this place and the owner is running the place'' AND OF COURSE THE OWNER WAS NOT AROUND. on second visit I ordered the bruschetta dish, no basil or olive oil was used !!!!</li><li>What you do get is your typical greek food that most people know ( gyro 's, souvlaki 's etc.)</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
