<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 272' %><h2>cooks<br />occurrence: 16</h2><div><ol><li>I think the cooks need more training and knowledge on how to cook a decent meal.</li><li>The avocado was n't ripe so it was hard and the cooks in the back came across as chop-lazy as almost all the avocado pieces were n't cut through- they were half cut so they were still stuck together.</li><li>Had the Beef Chow Fun and once I ordered it the cashier barked out the order in cantonese to old school short order cooks in their greased up whites, I knew this place could be for real.</li><li>It 's a shame that someone like that can ruin the reputation of a business when the cooks are working so hard.</li><li>Mains change seasonally, as pointed out on the Miller 's website, on the menu, on the postings on your way into the restaurant, by the wait staff, the cooks, the dishwasher, the couple at the next table, and by the drunken girls giggling on the subway on my way home, and I swear by Lloyd Robertson on the 11; 00 news.</li><li>Over all, a nice place but if we come back, we 'll be sure to order something different next time! ok it 's no fluke the wood oven pizza here is very good. ( we ordered two kinds to try) the dough, sauce and cheese the base ingredients of most any pizza are top notch. the crust i would describe .. it 's not a thin where it 's paper thin and it 's not cooked crisp like I 've had at many other thin crust pizza places. having its so crisp hides the true identity of the pizza dough. how can one taste the crust if it 's burnt !? the crust is thin where one can bite into the dough know it 's dough and not thick enough to not overwhelm the toppings. my quattro stagione was made wrong though .. it suppose to be separate quarters of pizza with the individual toppings. but instead it was a pizza with all the toppings. c 'mon just because I do n't look italian does n't mean I do n't know how it 's suppose to be. do n't give me stupid excuses that things get roughed up in the oven that why that make it that way ? i do n't care for the chatty waitress here and the ridiculous excuses, but as i mentioned in my first review. i will come here for the food because the cooks and chefs in the back know what they are doing ..</li><li>The cooks are very heavy handed with the salt.</li><li>Why eat at a GTA Filipino restaurant when you have aunts that are awesome cooks!</li><li>I had to ask the cashier where they were from and they are originally from Thailand, the cooks were the cashier 's mom and aunt.</li><li>Even the waitress felt that oddity when she was serving the food and started explaining that the cooks told her that it 's a kind of alleged bok choy, but she could n't finish her sentence ( showing that she did n't know what she was talking about- probably because she was n't explained by the cooks properly that wth was that).</li><li>The entire staff ( cooks and everything) are super efficient.</li><li>Needless to say, I was watching the cooks in their open kitchen and one cook makes the noodles by hand and then starts boiling the noodles.</li><li>I think the problem is the cooks that are hired.</li><li>She had long blonde hair, older) who was eating food through the pass through window where the cooks put the food out.</li><li>The cooks had to consult each other on how to prepare the various dishes.</li><li>He agrees the food used to be much better. what a shame ... kitchen looks dirty as hell ( and I 'm sorry, some of the cooks do too!)</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
