<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 5' %><h2>place<br />occurrence: 747</h2><div><ol><li>I wanted to like this place because it 's close by and convenient however unfortunately I did not, I got take out so maybe dinning in is better.</li><li>This place is a great lunch spot!</li><li>The place looked like a damp, dirty tables food leftovers everywhere.</li><li>The place is tidy but in a really worn out, tired looking building desperately in need of renovations, so this factor adds some grungyness.</li><li>Great place to come with friends have some middle eastern food, smoke some sesha not really sure how to spell it.</li><li>The tables were a little sticky and the place could use a bit of renovation.</li><li>The place itself was pretty basic holding maybe 40 people at most.</li><li>It is a bad joke that I hope you never visit to or at leadt I would like this place to shut down.</li><li>The place is big and nice.</li><li>The place is tiny so know that if you 're looking for a place to eat.</li><li>This place is always empty or near empty every time I walk by and it 's for a reason.</li><li>A balanced meal this is not, but next time I want something cheap in the neighbourhood that is n't a pizza or corned beef, I 'll check this place out again.</li><li>The place is very old and grimy, the food is basically tasteless and dry.</li><li>The place is very small and located in a end of a circular driveway of the NorthTown.</li><li>The place is tiny with about 5 tables.</li><li>The place is definitely very dated and run-down, with very minimal service, but the food is actually quite good and the price is even better.</li><li>There really was n't anything special about the place, but I will continue to be that odd individual who walks in, ignores everything else, and buys chicken skewers.</li><li>The place looks like it could 've been upscale back in the 80 's but is seriously flawed in it 's decor.</li><li>The place was bright and clean.</li><li>If your craving for ice cap at night and your in the area, this is the place to go.</li><li>I was greeted by the cute waitress ( I should mention, this place had always had very attractive service girls) who spend a whole ten seconds contemplating where to sit us in her completely empty restaurant.</li><li>And this place does n't have Redbull .... ARGH If you 're not korean, I believe they will service you slower.</li><li>Although the name suggests a fast food oriental restaurant, this place is anything but that.</li><li>The place was run by a really nice, outgoing guy ( Jerry ?) who was talkative with everyone that came in.</li><li>The place is located on a strip mall next to Food Basics.</li><li>I get that this place is a few months old, but they need to get their business together.</li><li>The place however, looks more like a restaurant that I actually want to spend some time in.</li><li>Looked tired and I felt like an inconvenience to them. not good The place: Dusty.</li><li>Also this place is a sister chain to NY Fries, so those are the types of fries they serve.</li><li>The place is clean with nice furniture.</li><li>Overall, this place is a valid option to come for drinks with a friend as they do have an extensive sake and wine menu.</li><li>I really like this place!</li><li>This place is the upscale brother of Momo Yama located just west of yonge on steeles.</li><li>That 's why I really like this place also, bc they are generous.</li><li>This place was a bit of a disappointment.</li><li>I 'm not huge on Japanese food but this place definitely changed my mind and shone as one of the best, if not the best, Japanese restaurants I 've ever been to.</li><li>Overall, this place was very tasty and better than other Japanese restaurants I 've been to.</li><li>The restaurant felt more like a bar than a sushi restaurant, which made me feel a bit out of place ( everyone eating lunch here was wearing business attire; I had a backpack with me damnit!</li><li>One time they forgot the water and I had to ask someone else so that 's why I give it 4/5 but other than that good place! we stopped by for lunch today. the decor looked fancy, i like the environment. the price tag is a bit on the expensive side. you 're looking at 20-30 dollars easy per person. i do like their quality of food. we had some salmon and tuna nigiris and they were pretty fresh! the staff there are attentive. cute place! although this place was suggested by my cousin ( because his friend owns the place), i was unimpressed by their sushi/sashimi. it was n't fresh! yes, the place is nice, trendy and huge, but i would n't go here for their sushi.</li><li>Bottom line: this place is expensive but good.</li><li>Spacious place, nice design.</li><li>This is the kind of place I would take my friends to for a sushi dinner party.</li><li>Great place to go with friends and do a boozy dinner.</li><li>This is definitely a place to bring a date, your significant other, or a group of friends that want to chill and enjoy a nice sushi dinner together.</li><li>Moto is the place to go for Sushi if you live uptown.</li><li>Firstly, this place is semi expensive so I expected good food.</li><li>The food is amazing, the place is clean and the staff is always polite.</li><li>Worst aspect of this place is the dry and stale wasabi.</li><li>So Let the good times Roll!;) The place is very trendy and spacious.</li><li>The place is a really small area but the food makes up for it.</li><li>The place was dirty and run down.</li><li>Love this place !!</li><li>Love this place ... always get the caesar salad, escargots and a veal dish .. I just read that it is now closed.</li><li>This is not a fancy, sophisticated, nor contemporary place, shabby for some, but Chez Laurent is a quiet authority on experience.</li><li>There was one other couple in our room who talked our ears off through the entire meal about how awesome this place is.</li><li>The place is nice and clean.</li><li>The place is surprisingly clean, bright and spacious especially for this area.</li><li>Due to all the residences nearby ( lots of senior housing) this place is always busy. if you actually want to sit and eat in here ... well good luck if you find a seat.</li><li>Anyone in the mood for great food, a wonderful baked good or an adventure down the aisle to try a little something of an international taste IDF is the place to go.</li><li>So gross, please avoid this horrible place! was ordering a pizza from that location, tonight. the pizza was OK. and they came just on the last second as they were looking for my house. would not order again probably, there are way better places for pizza in the area like King David Kosher Pizza.</li><li>This place is a joke.</li><li>So, I like this place.</li><li>The place was decently busy but we were seated immediately and had fantastic service the entire night.</li><li>I live relatively close to Laterna and its great to place an order for pick up, or sit down for a quick meal.</li><li>If I 'm not sure what to eat around my area this place is the place to go since their menu is so vast.</li><li>This place is a hidden gem in North York!</li><li>I do find that this place is a bit on the pricier side compared to other Korean restaurants, but the quality is definitely high When here for dinner the standard choices we get are the chicken ginseng soup and a hot stone bibimbap.</li><li>I really like this place.</li><li>Other than samquetang, their menu selection is not very big, but I kinda like the fact that I do n't have to take too long to look over the menu It 's a pretty small place, so I 'd recommend a reservation to secure a spot on weekends.</li><li>This place is a hidden gem in a small strip plaza.</li><li>Best place to go on on a cold night. it 's a small placed so it can get crowded during peak hours.</li><li>Not too many Korean restaurants in the area so if you 're craving traditional Korean food this is the place to go.</li><li>The place was n't bad I did find the Korean food more bland than other places I go too.their ambient is casual and it looks clean.</li><li>I LOVE THIS PLACE! a nice addition to the area, very fresh ingredients, ginseng soup is good but not overwhelming in ginseng.</li><li>The place is clean and staff is friendly.</li><li>- APPS: This place does n't have mashed potatoes or a potato appetizer at all.</li><li>For a guy traveling from B-town, this place is ridiculously out of the way, and crammed into a small run-down plaza, but would it be worth the drive ?</li><li>So with that I only had one last thing that could make me like this place: the food.</li><li>This place, however, perhaps not.</li><li>The place is small but it 's definitely a reliable place in terms of what you can expect.</li><li>Love this place!</li><li>As some fellow reviewers branded this place Hakka food, I do n't quite agree with that, I would say it is Szechuan style.</li><li>But the food is absolutely wonderful. we are regular customer, s at this restaurant, Tonight we ordered the usual, our favourte dish is peanut chicken, we brought our three dish, s home and upon opening the chicken we saw half the dish was peanut sauce and less than half the usual amount of chicken, I called the restaurant and spoke to the owner for ten minutes, she insisted that it was made the same as always, It was not at all, we paid 11,95 for peanut sauce and a small amount of chicken,, The arrogant owner could not care less, refusing to credit us for next time we picked up, or d delivering a new dish to our home, This place the staff is unfriendly, not well mannered, and horrible customer service, and the food was awful, except for the fried rice, it was good, If your looking for bad service this is the place to go, the customer is never right,, be warned, When Szechuan was still something Torontonians lined up for, Henry 's Hunan Place was the place to beat.</li><li>This place is a hidden gem.</li><li>Plus, I will definitely recommend this place to whoever wants good Korean food with friendly service.</li><li>Also, this place is more expensive than many other Korean restaurants I have been to.</li><li>If you just need a quick breakfast a step above mcDonalds- well Cora 's is the place to be.</li><li>I Ordered the Theo 's omelette and could n't even finish half of it Cons:- unlike other Coral restaurants, this location looks pretty run down and old.- long line up on the weekend Love this place!</li><li>The only good thing about the place was extremely efficient Asian server.</li><li>I have never walked into this place before 1am so my judgment could be a little clouded on this but this place always does the job.</li><li>Well, ok, not worst, as there are places that gave me upset stomachs afterward, and this place, in all fairness, never has.</li><li>NOTE: This place does n't really serve you, so you do not need to give tips.</li><li>This place is a sh* t show.</li><li>The place is extremely busy with wait times extending up to 30 minutes and it is definitely under staffed which is why I would award 4 stars instead of 5.</li><li>This is a terrible excuse for a thai fusion ... i really hope there is something better in Toronto; ( The place was over rated.</li><li>Place is like a banquet hall.</li><li>The chinese food is tolerable if it comes with enough rice to absorb the extra grease and the saltiness of the stir fry, Chic place to hang out with friends.</li><li>This place was a huge disappointment.</li><li>The place is clean, the service is quick and the employees are happy.</li><li>Good place to go if ur hungry &amp; need a snack.</li><li>Yes this place is a bit on a the pricey side ( $ 9-13 for 6-8 huge rolls) but it is worth it.</li><li>Like this place was was abit dirty, but the food was amazing.</li><li>Food: 3.5/5 Ambience: 3/5 Service: 4/5 Cleanliness: 3.5/5 If you like spicy food, this place is for you.</li><li>The place is not exactly the cleanest and tables are covered with plastic just cause chili oil could create a mess.</li><li>Short Version: This place is pretty authentic Chongqing food.</li><li>Sichuan food is widely recognized as the spicy cuisine in China, and if you are serious about getting authentic, spicy ( as the name of the restaurant indicates) Chinese food, this is the place to be in Toronto to try out for at least once.</li><li>Cafe bene is a warm and cozy place which makes it an absolutely great place to chill with friends and family.</li><li>Love this place.</li><li>This place is a little bit hidden, you have to walk up a small staircase at the entrance of a wings restaurant.</li><li>Considering the nature of the yelp reviews boucing between ratings, it clear that this place is a great example of hit or miss. Would love to come back to check out the private rooms or order shaved ice, but it may be a while ... at least until my wallet stops sighing.</li><li>Cute place, clean although the service was slow.</li><li>The place is cozy with friendly staff.</li><li>This place was a pleasant surprise, and an absolute gem of a place.</li><li>The only good thing about it is the interior which is kind of cute, but the place tries too hard to appear more than it actually is.</li><li>The place is frankly in the middle of no where right next to some traintracks.</li><li>This place is the best!</li><li>Cheap dinner if you 're in the area, this place is a must!</li><li>Me and my girlfriend do n't know what it is about this place, I 've tried numerous pho stores and by numerous I mean a shit load.</li><li>The place was pretty full for a weekday afternoon.</li><li>From all the places I 've been to so far, this place has the best avocado shakes ( $ 3).</li><li>I do n't want to eat pho anywhere else now, this place is SO GOOD.</li><li>I have yet to have incredible pho but this place was n't bad.</li><li>The place: The place is like any average Asian joint.</li><li>Wow, this place is pretty damn good.</li><li>I do n't reccomend this place to anybody.</li><li>The place is small and has a vintage vibe to it.</li><li>The place is dated but the food.</li><li>Came in for dinner with my girlfriend, the place is nice and inviting, well maintained and friendly staff.</li><li>This place is a local classics, having been a landmark in the area for over 200 years ( at one point owned by my great-great-great-grandparents!)</li><li>This place does n't look like much on the outside, but it 's definitely worth the wander inside.</li><li>We went for a family reunion dinner and this place was such a surprise.Everything we ordered was so tasty, fresh and hot.From the mushroom salad to the lasagna to the pasta pescatore all were superb.I heartily recommend this place to any discerning lover of fine italian food.Please continue!</li><li>At first glance, the place is n't much to look at from the outside.</li><li>Kind of takes you away from the busy city life and into some relaxing place.</li><li>The place is a bit upscale but still low key.</li><li>I would recommend this restaurant for an affordable sushi meal at Yonge and Sheppard.:) The atmosphere of this place was nice and quiet although we did go at an odd hour so no one else was inside.</li><li>We got a booth seat which was nice and comfortable, the place is quiet enough for conversation with cheesy pop holiday music playing in the background which provided some giggles.</li><li>Aesthetically, this place looks very tired and needs a make-over.</li><li>Love this place!</li><li>This place is the bomb.</li><li>The place is tiny and was probably a small Italian takeout as evidenced by this small Italian figurette that they left on the table ( probably from the old place ?).</li><li>If you like dominoes that is fine, but this location is a complete horrid place to expect any decent service from or any actual hot food.</li><li>I really wanted to like this place, but it came up short in every area.</li><li>Best place to go to ruin a birthday!</li><li>This place is dated in time, which often makes me scared it 's really dirty.</li><li>The place is small and a bit dingy, but whatever, the food is good, fast and cheap!</li><li>Will not recommended this place to any of my family or friends and it will be the first and last time going there.</li><li>It is a nice little place.</li><li>The place is in a majot need of a renovation, so that it can compete with the barrage of other restaurants so densely squeezed on this plot of land at Yonge &amp; Finch.</li><li>LOVE THIS PLACE TO DEATH: D** UPDATE** This place is closed for good and has been replaced with Yuzu Izakaya.</li><li>What it lacks in innovation, this place certainly brings it in terms of value.</li><li>This place is a Toronto institution.</li><li>Best place in the area for some good high quality deli.</li><li>There were surprisingly quite a few people inside at lunch time even though this place is tucked away in the middle of nowhere.</li><li>I without a doubt recommend this place to everyone and anyone, and will definitely be coming back !!</li><li>I 've been here plenty of times over the years and still believe this place is a hidden gem in North York.</li><li>Love this place.</li><li>This place is Korean own, so they have some Korean menu items as well.</li><li>But must mention the following too:- Line up to pay- Onion grilled with the skin still on ( from no frills to the grills)- half chicken not fully cooked inside but burnt outside- too much tahini in the hummus- beef a bit dry Other than that the rest was good Great place to share food and chit chat.</li><li>No wonder this place is n't busy.</li><li>This place is a diamond in the rough.</li><li>This is the place to go if you want cheap delicious food!</li><li>Hidden in a dingey runned down plaza, this place is small cramped, poor ventilation but surprisingly has some pretty good food. beef patties are made fresh here and still on the trays.</li><li>The place was absolutely packed and buzzing ... really loud!</li><li>There were a few empty tables on a Saturday Night- but compared to the dozens of crappy Italian and French restaurants in town, this place should be packed and lined up down the street!</li><li>The place is an operational disaster.</li><li>This place is a joke, worse service I have ever experienced.</li><li>This place is n't as good as all the hype.</li><li>The place is brightly lit and has a modern, fresh look.</li><li>Yes, the place could go through some much needed renovations, make that the whole plaza in fact, but the history of batter and cooking oil have left their mark on these walls.</li><li>I noticed a group of men in their 70s dining in and sensing their comfort in a familiar place justifies the glory days of this place, however fishy it may be for some.</li><li>We love this place, the haddock is moist and F' in HUGE.</li><li>I always thought fish n chips would come with coleslaw but this place did n't.</li><li>The place cooked everything very well.</li><li>The place is pretty clean, quick service and alot of room to sit. only thing is cash order area where cash is a bit small, not alot of people can fit but it good food.</li><li>Compared to anything at bayview village, this place is `` reasonably'' priced for what you get.</li><li>Good place to come with a group of friends for a quick bite Stopped by the mall to get some errands done, and decided to get something to eat.</li><li>It does n't seem like a place I can go to complain, and $ 10 for inedible chewy General Tao `` chicken'' is just not okay in my world.</li><li>3.5 If you 're looking for a decent Chinese experience without all of the fluff, Sun Star is a place you might want to check out Pros: Food is pretty good Prices are OK Cons: Portions are smaller If you do n't know about this place, chances are you will never see it even if you 're driving by.</li><li>The place is nothing fancy to look at but who cares when the food tastes this good and prices are so reasonable.</li><li>Yes, the place is shabby in appearance -- orange walls leave less to be desired, but the weather was nice and we ate outside.</li><li>This place is pretty average.</li><li>DO NOT WASTE ANY DOLLARS ON THIS PLACE !!!!!!!</li><li>Again, if you 're craving a burrito, this place should suffice.</li><li>As a vegetarian, I have to say the soy burritos are probably the BEST in the city ( THIS PLACE IS A MUST TRY FOR VEGETARIANS).</li><li>The place is charming, the wait staff is truly delightful ... a re-evaluation of the kitchen is essential.</li><li>Uhmmmmmmm ... yeah, this place is fantastic!</li><li>If you need a quick and filling Filipino food fix, this is the place to go to.</li><li>The place was small and I can see how it would fill up quick.</li><li>Well, this place was both totally worth the drive out to North York and my calorie count for the evening ( week really- yay cheat meals!).</li><li>Love this place I always come here for delicious smoothies and gourmet grilled cheese.</li><li>I really do n't like this place.</li><li>It does n't get any better.:) This place is a lot better than any pho place downtown.</li><li>No one makes pho like this place.</li><li>This place is a legend.</li><li>This place is a very close 2nd to my very favourite pho ' Hung long'.</li><li>This place is the 2nd closest korean resto from my work ( the closest one is not even worth a mention).</li><li>The place is crowded yet clean and spacey.</li><li>If you have n't tried this place out then ur simply missing out.</li><li>Been here a few times The place is small so it 's recommended that you get a reserve Sushi is quite tasty Loved the enoki rolls .....</li><li>I do n't usually expect much from ayce but this place was a pleasant surprise.</li><li>The place is clean, the service is good and fast too, you should reserve in advance if you come in peak hours otherwise you have to wait for quite a long time.</li><li>Just no any other place would beat their quality foods. the sashimi are fresh and the hot foods are above average. this place is always packed, but soon you will notice it is worth the wait after you taste their foods. if they would have more selection of sakes that will be perfect as i am a sake lover: -p.</li><li>Food wise, this place is pretty decent, the Scallop Sashimi and the Squid ( Ika) Sushi are indeed the highlight of this restaurant!</li><li>This place was n't all that amazing ..</li><li>I wanted to like this place and to be quite honest I do n't think I can rate it fairly when I was n't able to try dinner as I currently have a bun in my oven ... seemed pointless to go for dinner when I ca n't eat the best part ... sashimi.</li><li>The place was busy, but we were quickly seated even though a few people in our group were still on their way ( cool!).</li><li>This place is always busy so make sure you either come early or get a reservation.</li><li>Highly recommend this place I like hang out sushi AYCE or other Buffets for lunch alone on every Saturday.</li><li>Have some business sense. the best sushi ever, the most unique rolls, quality ingredients, excellent staff and service, must come back !! puts sushi on the level of heaven This place is a good place for a buffett!</li><li>The place are opened by Mainland China people.</li><li>Tenichi is the place to go for AYCE japanese.</li><li>I deducted 1 star because the place could be cleaner.</li><li>In conclusion, this place is overpriced, food with terrible ingredients, and bland presentation.</li><li>The service is decent, and I recommend this place to someone who likes to dine in a very casual setting.</li><li>The place is small and tables are tightly packed, but they serve great, fresh, made-to-order, no nonsense, authentic Filipino food ...</li><li>The place is busy, but service is quick and they do n't miss a beat.</li><li>The place is a tad small ( they should expand- hint hint!) but the service is quite fast ..</li><li>Anyway, this place is certainly cheap ( daily special), but you get what you paid for.</li><li>And the washroom are messy Terrible place.</li><li>COSTS This place is a tad more expensive than the traditional Pho restaurants.</li><li>The place is pretty good.</li><li>The place is pretty busy every night, which is good considering the area.</li><li>Good place to go with your date.</li><li>Tim Hortons is the place to be.</li><li>The place is never full when I am there ( there were only 2 other people there when I went today).</li><li>This place is a little restaurant for bubble tea or homestyle Taiwanese food/snacks.</li><li>The place is clean and quiet.</li><li>So I was in the area and after hearing a lot of stories about the place, decided to have lunch there.</li><li>The place does n't look that appealing from the outside due to its location but it 's Toronto, so the food is what matters.</li><li>The place looked clean and the service was okay.</li><li>The place does seem a little sketchy at first based on its location, and inside, like more Carribean take out places are very basic ( not updated) Note, they do not take credit or debit.</li><li>The place is a marble rotunda style atrium with lot of original art exhibits.</li><li>So this place is a bit hidden in a local community centre, and it is a bit weird to be walking into a dressy place with people in gym sweats staring at you, while working out.</li><li>The place was absolutely TRASHED- like food garbage on every single table there.</li><li>The place was fairly clean and the washrooms are relatively clean compared to other comparable restaurants in the area.</li><li>Even though the place was small, she did n't seem to be able to handle all of the tables efficiently.</li><li>Really nice place ... a bit small ... ok cozy!</li><li>-CL The place is kind of in the middle of no where, along Bathurst St. There 's no way I would have come across this place without the aid of the Yelp app though.</li><li>If you like Mexican food this is the place, good food, good prices, there beef burritos are really good.</li><li>Love this place, food is fantastic and service is fast.</li><li>If you are looking for a place that sells good food for cheap, this is the place to go.</li><li>Love this place!</li><li>The portions are huge and when you 're in a carbo-loading mood, this place definitely hits the spot!</li><li>Decent place to head to after a softball league game.</li><li>I love this place, but it 's only good to go during winter time.</li><li>Pho and Spring Rolls are generally the two things I try to tell if I like a Vietnamese restaurant and this place does both of them well.</li><li>The decor looks like it was bought from the tropical section of Party Packagers but the place is clean and the service was very good.</li><li>I never go out of my way for Thai food but this place was n't bad.</li><li>I know this place did n't get a lot of good reviews but I 'd like to take a moment to share my thoughts on this establishment.</li><li>Great place, great service and great food.</li><li>I give three stars because it 's still a good place to go eat and I will be back for more for sure, but this place to me lacks consistency.</li><li>I 've been to a lot of pho places, this place charge $ 6 for a big size special pho noodle, fresh side dishes and best hit chilli, give it a shot Favorite Pho in Toronto.</li><li>Nothing compares the theirs! 5/5 for that dish It 's a great quick place to eat!</li><li>Love this place!</li><li>The place was very nice on the inside, and the lady that was there was okay but seems like someone who hates everyone and probably should n't be in that kind of work.</li><li>Like others have commented, this place is pretty clean.</li><li>This place is a waste of space.</li><li>The place is small and family managed, which would normally mean good service, or at least attempted good service.</li><li>The only place I order Thai food from in the area !!!</li><li>The place is small so seating is a bit limited during the rush times like lunch and dinner.</li><li>This place does a lot of take-out and unless you are as moody as the guy cashier i would n't really suggest eating in.</li><li>The place is like a family restaurant so it was a little slow at first but the server is super nice and knows the authentic Thai cuisine well.</li><li>This is a nice Thai place in the area .. and it 's authentic ( the people who work there are Thai), not the nicest restaurant I 've been to but sometimes you 're just coming for the food!</li><li>My first visit there today and although the place seems a bit hidden from outdoor, it 's a nice cozy place on uptown Yonge street.</li><li>The place is decorated well, but nothing special.</li><li>This place is n't much to look at on the inside and I reckon they could do a little work on the outside to give it more curb appeal but the service is friendly and the seating area is well laid out.</li><li>Unfortunately, this place is easily the worst Indian food I have had in Toronto.</li><li>Please take my advice and skip this place, they are not worthy of your money, business or patronage.</li><li>I never tried the other dishes, why try pho in a bun bo Hue place ?</li><li>This place is a gem for great Iranian food.</li><li>Like Chatime 's all over Ontario, this place does not disappoint.</li><li>However this place is always busy, so that 's a good sign.</li><li>This place is always busy and service is pretty efficient.</li><li>This place is always busy but I will keep going back anyways.</li><li>If you 've never been to a chatime, this place has bubble tea like no other.</li><li>That being said, the place WASN' T BAD.</li><li>If you go during the day, it is a nice place to study.</li><li>Best place for bubble tea.</li><li>This place is always busy during the dinner hours so it 's better to put a reservation down or you can order takeout online on their website.</li><li>If you like saucy pastas, this place is definitely the place you want to visit.</li><li>Definitely a nice looking place since the expansion and the latest renovation.</li><li>I will definitely be coming back and recommending this place to all my friends!</li><li>Years ago, this place was a small, mostly take out pizza place at Bayview Village Mall.</li><li>The place is n't half bad ...</li><li>The place is clean, has ample seating, sports on mostly ( great during boxing championships or hockey playoffs) and is a bit dim even for a sports bar.</li><li>Ok, so back to the actual pub. This place is a long, inside box!</li><li>It 's a slightly small place and had to wait a couple minutes for a table to free up at 6:30pm on a sunday but that was okay.</li><li>The place was fluorescent lit with a lot of smoky smells coming from the other tables having BBQ at their tables.</li><li>Fluorescent lights and the place could use a makeover.</li><li>That said, the service was great, the food was great, the place is clean.</li><li>The place felt classy, food was not bad.</li><li>The place was n't very busy on a Saturday night, but I figured we went rather early.</li><li>Looking in from the outside, this place always appeared very dark and gloomy, and when we were seated inside, the interior is pretty much the same.</li><li>There are n't many Italian restaurants in the area so if you want a decent Italian meal this is the place to go.</li><li>The place does n't have a cool hipster atmosphere like places downtown.</li><li>I first thought to myself `` This place looks nice!''</li><li>Satays were also pretty nice; a lot of places fail at the sauce but this place was pretty authentic.</li><li>The place is lovely!</li><li>While dining, the waitress would converse with other diners, however she never checked in on our table once, other than to whisk away plates the moment our food was done- we felt rushed the whole time and the place was n't even busy!</li><li>I like this place.</li><li>This place is pretty chic and nicely decorated.</li><li>Generally I do n't like to spend too much on food but for this place I can make an exception.</li><li>I love Thai food, but this place was just average for me.</li><li>This place is a bit pricy though for what is it.</li><li>Anyway, nice place to relax if you like.</li><li>If you live in the Finch and Leslie area or anywhere near by, this is the place to go to get your Chinese BBQ fix.</li><li>Overall, this place is n't bad for grabbing a quick bite with no expectations for service.</li><li>Love this place, simple, simple.</li><li>First off, this place was a little confusing to find because the sign on the road was in between 2 plazas and we wandered into the wrong area.</li><li>He keeps telling me how great this place is ... how this family-owned business is so ethical and how their standards are so high.</li><li>The place looked a bit run down.</li><li>I wanted to love this place ...</li><li>The place was fresh.</li><li>Not that I ever expect much from a fast food place, let alone a McDonalds, this place takes the cake for exceptionally poor service.</li><li>It 's not a nice looking place ( from the inside or the outside) 4.</li><li>The place is open a bit later than many other places, but as with most, the earlier the better.</li><li>The place is plastered with random Chinese calligraphy drawings that has nothing to do with the Xinjing Muslim theme, and adverts of the restaurant itself, just in case you forgot where you were.</li><li>Love this place.</li><li>The place is clean and spacious.</li><li>Overall I do like this place, their food is generally pretty good and if you like lamb, you should check it out.</li><li>This is not your run-of-the-mill Hakka place, this place serves Xinjiang style food, so do n't think Hakka or typical Chinese food, the spices here are very different.</li><li>The place is clean and it 's pretty nice inside.</li><li>If you can handle spices, you 'll like this place.</li><li>The place was very clean and the servers were nice.</li><li>However everything about this place was nice.</li><li>Yes, the people that work there look at me and my cousin ( Yelper Z) very weird like I was in the wrong place BUT O MY GOODNESS!</li><li>Do n't be fooled by the exterior and the neighbouring shops in the plaza, this place is a gem!</li><li>The place is not fancy but the service is terrific.</li><li>Would give it five stars but this place is badly in need of a makeover.</li><li>There 's quite a few mixed reviews about this place, but since I was there on a Sunday, it was quiet.</li><li>This place needs some attention.</li><li>It 's an unassuming place to say the least, located in a strip mall on a block of strip malls and apartment buildings on Victoria Park, it has a small sign and very understated and dated decor.</li><li>This place is a keeper and a must try.</li><li>I really wanted to like this place more ...</li><li>As I 've mentioned, I really wanted to like this place more.</li><li>Favorite place to go as a kid for breakfast !!</li><li>Located in the far north of the city, Kivas is the kind of place where everybody knows your name.</li><li>Service could be better and the place could be less packed, but you ca n't control that sometimes.</li><li>The place is always packed, if you want brunch go really early morning.</li><li>About standard pricing $ 9 range for Benny Kids breakfast is really nice- not cheap but good portion The place is a bit small, but the food is fresh, you can see the guys making it.</li><li>Not only was the food horrible and the price too high for what you get, but this place would be better served as a adult film store due to the bad lighting than a restaurant calling itself the `` Sunshine Spot''.</li><li>Its fine, nothing amazingly tasty but if you are in the area and want to grab a bite, this place is acceptable as long as they are not too busy because then the attentiveness from the server seems to be lacking.</li><li>UMMM ... I 'm torn to write this review ... because I really really wanted to like this place a lot more ... I thought that it was my new haven ... but the truth shall set you free ....</li><li>The place looks like it 's going to fall apart.</li><li>The place is definitely under-staffed and it 's definitely not the waiters and waitresses faults for not being up to par with service.</li><li>If you expect high end, modern, fancy, trendy ambiance, this place isnt for you.</li><li>If you want good food and down to earth wait straff and low key restaurant, this is the place to go.</li><li>I have also had lobster in Maine and cooked the Lobster fresh from T &amp; T supermarket and by comparison, this place is very good.</li><li>The place is pretty packed for a snow-storm, was wondering why even though it is so busy that they only have one person serving so many tables.</li><li>I 'm not a lobster fisherman nor a commodities economist when it comes to seafood but when I 'm used to lobster prices at Chinese restaurants, this place I find is a bit on the pricier side.</li><li>The place is clean, the service is good, and the food is tasty it 's definitely one of the better Vietnamese places in the area.</li><li>The place is clean though.</li><li>Great food at this place No matter what location you go to Turnips BBQ Pork Udon Shanghai Noodles Even the Thai food is decent Have had both the mango salad and the pad thai is quite yummy My parents have always ordered their Chinese food since it arrived We 'll definitely keep ordering from here Um .... I had the weirdest chinese dish; perhaps this place is a bit too traditional for me.</li><li>Thanks to all you Yelpers that rave about this place, you definitely know what you 're talking about.</li><li>Love this place.</li><li>This place is always good.</li><li>Great place to go for a meal, especially for big groups and families, though also works well for singles and couples.</li><li>Great for lunch at time. yummmm !! def going back ... awesome hot and sour soup seafood fried rice and everything else ..:) The place is pretty big.</li><li>However towards the 5 PM, the place started filling up and you could see a line forming at the door.</li><li>My fave Congee ( royal title) chain, but also everyone else 's as well- This place is always packed!</li><li>We ordered the following dishes: Salt and pepper squid- Lightly battered and deep fried, delicious Empress Fried Rice- Had bonito flakes, delicious BBQ duck- Roasted duck is great, delicious Fried bean curd with veggies- It seemed more like tofu to me, delicious Fried eggplant, minced and salted fish with spicy sauce- I 'm allergic to eggplant, ate it anyways, not my favourite dish but I 'll eat it I guess Fried rice noodle with beef and scrambled egg sauce- This was my favourite dish there, would 10/10 recommend eating again, delicious This place is a chain, and some places are better than other, but this one is great!</li><li>The place was not very busy when we arrived, we were seated right away.</li><li>Although during peak hours, this place can be really crowded and seats/tables are a bit tight, I still like eating here.</li><li>We were here early for lunch and we were glad cuz even though the place is big, it still filled up fast!</li><li>The place is clean, service is quick, and the food is excellent.</li><li>Third, their place are clean but their service and their actual kitchen is bad bad very bad.</li><li>This place is the only asian place that does not want to take your money.</li><li>Hey if you want some good congee, or decent chinese food this is the place to go.</li><li>The place was extremely crowded though, a lot of traffic in the afternoon.</li><li>I used to love this place, but sadly, I wo n't be coming back here.</li><li>If you want fantastic chinese food that is at an affordable price this is the place to go.</li><li>I do n't usually eat congee but this place was good.</li><li>This place is always packed on weekends.</li><li>Good place to chill ( with free wifi) compared to your local Starbucks:) I really like their drinks and snacks as well!</li><li>3.5 stars it 's an alright place to study since they offer wifi and close pretty late.</li><li>The place is very small to begin with and only 2 servers working.</li><li>Great place to chill with friends and have a nice cup of tea.</li><li>All in all though, I do n't think there 's anything distinctively special about this place, though if you want a large, unhealthy serving of meat ( we all crave this once in a while) then it 's a good choice.</li><li>But despite all the Korean restaurants, this place offers up AYCE, which is not as common around here as you think.</li><li>This place does n't have that option.</li><li>This place does n't.</li><li>If you want KBBQ with more than just pork belly, this is the place to go, as you do n't really have another choice in the area.</li><li>I really like this place.</li><li>The place is very casual and the service is okay.</li><li>Menu is rather small, as is the place, but they maximize filling in as many people as possible, with some cool little booths on the side as well.</li><li>We did n't get our appetizers until we asked them ( 30 minutes after we ordered) and it took about 40 minutes for us to get our food ... the place was n't even packed!</li><li>The place filled up by about 7pm, so be there early.</li><li>Most of the food we had tasted fresh and, with the strange assortment of food I usually eat at hotpot, this place was pretty good.</li><li>The place is a little small and was starting to fill up when we were leaving so going early/ making a reservation might be an idea here.</li><li>The place is clean.</li><li>The place is a bit small so I can imagine that there is a wait time during prime hours.</li><li>The only reason this place does n't get a full 5-star is that it 's a little cramped.</li><li>Love this place.</li><li>This place is pretty decent for the price.</li><li>I would definitely go again, and have no reservations recommending this place to anybody.</li><li>The place is small and not have room to sit all the time, but food is great price is more than reasonable and staff are friendly.</li><li>This place is a hidden gem in the Willowdale area and I am so glad that my friend took us here to get some cheap grub.</li><li>The place is super tiny and incredibly cramped.</li><li>It 's a very small place with a few tables, and not a lot of room to move around.</li><li>Sushi Bong is a small place where usually people would go for take outs.</li><li>Sushi Bong is the place to go if you want decent and cheap sushi.</li><li>The place is super small and it 's more for take out than actually dining in.</li><li>The place is small for a sit down meal so we always take out.</li><li>People really seem to love this place, but I feel like it must be more for the quantity than the quality ... ?</li><li>Ca n't believe I did n't find this place earlier.</li><li>If you want cheap, decent-quality sushi, this is the place to go.</li><li>What can I say that would be any different from all the previous reviews of this place ?</li><li>This place is a great take out restaurant but if you go when it is busy your guaranteed to get terrible customer service.</li><li>This place is always busy when I go, I do recommend to call ahead to place your order before dropping by.</li><li>The place is small but it 's also cold, especially in the winter time.</li><li>If you want cheap rolls this is the place to go.</li><li>The place is located in a small strip mall area just 7-10 minute walk south of Yonge and Finch and is a small place.</li><li>The place is extremely small and the service is decent.</li><li>One word of suggestion however, there is very limited seating ( the place is the equivalent to the size of a study room) and there is only three or four tables to sit at so it is best to order take-out and eat elsewhere.</li><li>The place is very nice organized tight clean.</li><li>If they lower the price of this place I probably will be coming here more often.</li><li>The place is loud and crowded with people standing around the tables.</li><li>The place is small so expect to wait or get take out.</li><li>Considering the size of the restaurant, this place is way too small for the demand it gets.</li><li>This place is pretty small.</li><li>Pros: huge bowls ( beef noodle soup $ 9.99, cold noodles $ 6.99- medium size but filling), handmade noodles in North York, a good size menu Cons: tiny shop ( has 4 2-person seats and bar stools for 5-ppl, even though it 's handmade it 's not as chewy as I 'd like I like this place because it 's not easy to find handmade Chinese noodles in the Yonge/finch-to-Shep area.</li><li>Do n't let the look of the food deceive u, this place is #puregarbage, everything is either mad sour or salty for no reason at all.</li><li>The place is small and I was very close to my neighbour who sat beside me.</li><li>I like this place, it 's just I never believe noodle places should be small.</li><li>This place is pretty popular.</li><li>My mom &amp; her friends seem to like this place &amp; some of my friends do too.</li><li>Yap, I really like this place.</li><li>A Good Place To Eat I come to this restaurant quite often.</li><li>Then you know, ten years later I forgotten about this place, until I needed to get lunch.</li><li>The place was always dimly lit, even in the window section facing North the Sun was mostly covered in foliage.</li><li>This is the place to go when you do n't want your server to talk to you or go even near you.</li><li>The place is busy from Noon through 3PM.</li><li>The place is clean &amp; the service was efficient.</li><li>A pretty quiet place I never knew existed until a few days ago.</li><li>I usually go for Peking dim sums and noodles here, especially after doctor 's appointment as it is on the ground floor of 2 medical buildings If you 're looking for a cool kitschy place, this is it!</li><li>The service is rather slow, but they never attempt to rush you to leave, so this was a great place to relax and socialize in the comfy chairs, as long as you do n't look too carefully at the wallpaper ...</li><li>This place is a TOTAL FIND in a small strip mall like area of Don Mills and York Mills.</li><li>I 'm surprised that this place does n't have more 5 stars.</li><li>It 's too bad this place ca n't find a rhythm, the food is incredible but the overall rushed feeling combined with delayed service is not worth the price.</li><li>I like this place, the food is good.</li><li>Be aware: this place is incredibly overpriced.</li><li>The place is not upscale, more like a hole in the wall but the best jumulruk ( steakettes) table top cooking.</li><li>The place was accommodating for a group of about fourteen people.</li><li>Everytime I come its clear the staff are working very hard, as this place is always packed and they are simply understaffed- Sometimes have to wait ( although well worth it) In this area there are MANY Korean options.</li><li>This place used to be, still is like my food court or the place to go when I could n't think of what I wanna eat.</li><li>I remember this clearly because at that moment I all could do laugh at how bad this place was.</li><li>It 's no fancy date spot, but if you want tons of good food at an extremely reasonable price, this is the place to go.</li><li>The place was busy so we shared a table with another patron which is fine.</li><li>The place is pretty cozy and there 's parking at the back so it 's convenient to drive to !!</li><li>The place was n't super busy.</li><li>The place is very small inside, 4 booths and only 5-6 tables and barely any room for you to stand while you wait.</li><li>Just to show how good this place was, my brother came to Oh Geul Boh Geul a second time within that 24 hours, this time, for an earlier dinner.</li><li>The place was terribly cold.</li><li>Ambiance/decor-3 Service-5 Food-4 Strikeouts-0/3 This place is a bit dark for my taste, but still good enough to take pictures.</li><li>Good place to go for groups.</li><li>I CANNOT SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS PLACE !!!!</li><li>I 'm also a full time athlete and this place does a great job at curbing my hunger!</li><li>Quiet place, cozy and literally the perfect spot to eat and go.</li><li>This place was a pleasant surprise I have to say!</li><li>The food is good but there just too rude bad service good food I would go back only for the food and Ima get the hell outta there Ambiance .... no Cleanliness .... questionable Mediocre Americanized Chinese food ...... check This place is a large run down looking resto with a friendly Chinese staff.</li><li>If your looking for an unhealthy and American style Chinese food experience, this place is probably ok for that.</li><li>The place was busy and as soon as tables left, new parties would come in and fill in the tables.</li><li>The place is exceptionally clean and tidy.</li><li>I recommend this place to all my friends.</li><li>The place was a lot smaller than I imagined with tables to accommodate about 30 people.</li><li>Disappointment Really nice little place.</li><li>Really nice dessert place.</li><li>The place is a bit small, but they have great selections of ice cream and crepes.</li><li>It 's quite a nice place to share desserts and have a nice latte over a chat with friends, and we were lucky enough to sit for a good 1.5 hour despite finishing our order.</li><li>Overall, I like this place.</li><li>Its a small, little place, but nice, cozy, warm, and friendly atmosphere.</li><li>The place is very small so limited seatings while being very popular.</li><li>Then this is the place to be!</li><li>Located in North York in the Yonge/Finch area, this place is a great joint to have coffee and dessert.</li><li>Feel like the place is a little bit cramped for a party of 2 though.</li><li>If you are trying to bring your `` special'' friend to somewhere nice and a place where you can talk, this place is for you.</li><li>First of all, this place is so bright, clean and organized it puts our hospitals to shame.</li><li>I do n't recommend this place to any one.</li><li>This place is the bomb!</li><li>Free wifi is a bonus.Highly recommend this place ...</li><li>The place is small and cozy and they have a lot of variety in the menu ( at least for a dessert place).</li><li>Nice and modern, this place serves some good lunch options like stuffed crèps and wonderful waffles as well as a good selection of some tasty beverages.</li><li>Love this place cause the staff love their job:) Super cute place for a date.</li><li>The Nutella crepe had too much whipped cream and not enough Nutella, but for the price and the place, I really loved Pastel.</li><li>Pho Mi Asia is the place to go for the best Bún bò Hu and Banh Xeo.</li><li>The place is n't very clean as well ..</li><li>Very very busy at 1pm Food is good but the place is n't cozy.</li><li>Best place in the GTA for Vietnamese food.</li><li>PLEASEEEE READ ALL REVIEWS BEFORE ENTERING THIS PLACE!</li><li>The place was homey and a little run down but nonetheless a great place to dine.</li><li>The place does n't have a great ambiance, but the food definitely makes it worth coming here.</li><li>Great place to meet a client or a friend.</li><li>All in all, I really like this place.</li><li>This place is n't fancy, but it 's a wonderful alternative to the din of the food court.</li><li>Compared to other places in the area, this place is cheap for beers.</li><li>This place is the best-kept secret in the city.</li><li>This place is a huge waste of money.</li><li>Great place, I really like a lot of their dishes/rolls.</li><li>Great place, prices are reasonable and the food is consistently high quality.</li><li>The place is designed with pink detailings which is perfect for ladies night out.</li><li>To be honest, I 've heard raving reviews about this place, and decided to give it a try.</li><li>He wants to send another one of the same pizza he admitted they ca n't make it properly .at this point I was so angry i juust thanked and hung up the phone.now pizza is in trash, waste of money and time and I 'm still hungry.DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE.</li><li>I like this place.</li><li>This place is n't cheap.</li><li>If you work in the area and want a quick sushi fix, this place is a decent option, but I would n't go out of my way to try it!</li><li>The place was n't even half full.</li><li>I hate giving a negative review but someone needs to realize this place needs a lot of improvement if it wants to survive: ( My mom and I come here every week for sushi and it 's always amazing !!!</li><li>I am very critical and picky about my sushi places and have been to a thousand of them, and this place is always fantastic ( have been about 30 times by now).</li><li>This place is a pretty decent size.</li><li>The place is not usually busy, but the service is always slow.</li><li>I was searching for a go-to sushi place in north York so I thought ... why not try this place ?</li><li>The place is kept clean, even though there are a few chairs and tables that could be replaced as the overuse of them can be seen and felt when sat on or touched.</li><li>Like the ambience even is a small place is cozy.</li><li>The place is a bit small, if only me and my husband go, we dont have to wait but with my 3 kids, always wait for 10-15min.</li><li>This place is always my first choice when I 'm craving a pint and some wings.</li><li>I 've checked out this place earlier this week after reading the good reviews they posted on their Window.</li><li>I highly recommend this place to any wing and burger lover around the globe!</li><li>Need a relaxed place to sit, enjoy good food and linger to play catch up.</li><li>The breakfast special is priced very well ( especially before 11am for 4.99) however the menu is a but on the pricey side for a diner. the food quality and taste, did however make up for this. its a great little place to pop into for a more gourmet style diner food experience.</li><li>Overall: I really enjoyed the experience and can see why people like this place a lot.</li><li>This place is a bit pricey for breakfast.</li><li>The place was clean and the waitress was friendly.</li><li>Lastly, as previously mention, this place does n't take credit cards which means they should probably move to a more remote location if they feel like scamming taxes.</li><li>The place was half full already.</li><li>The place was practically full the time I went in the morning I 'm a regular at Hazel 's.</li><li>Great little place, food was good and prices reasonable.</li><li>This would be fine, since it 's definitely a `` nicer'' place, but these `` nicer'' places usually step it up a bit with a nice garnish of fruit or beans or something like that ( see George St. Diner, The Senator).</li><li>What really adds to the charm of this place is the service.</li><li>Overall, this place is okay if I 'm super desperate for sushi.</li><li>Good place, lots of seating, really clean.</li><li>Nice place, friendly people, good food!</li><li>This place is always packed for meal time.</li><li>Love this place!</li><li>Ive introduced this place to all of my friends and none have ever complained about the soup or service.</li><li>Well, this place does n't sell pork bone soup.</li><li>This place is always packed for reason.</li><li>The place is n't really baby friendly since the bathrooms are located downstairs and there 's no place to change the little one, but they were totally okay with me carting my big stroller in and plunking it next to our table and letting me take up a chair for the car seat.</li><li>The place is small and sitting by 2 we basically shared a table with the people next to us.</li><li>This place is always crowded and has a long line.</li><li>This place is always the same.</li><li>When it 's cold outside, this place will warm you up.</li><li>The place is small and the lineups are long during meal hours.</li><li>The place is nice and clean inside with air conditioning ( thank God- real scorcher at the time).</li><li>Overall, nice and comfortable place to be!</li><li>I strongly recommend this place to anybody looking for a quick Korean fix at a reasonable price point.</li><li>If your into Korean soups/stews this is the place to be, especially on a cold winter day.</li><li>This place is always busy but I find service always courteous.</li><li>It 's too bad this place is really going downhill with every visit.</li><li>Love this place.</li><li>The place is tight, loud, and messy.</li><li>We 've tried tofu dishes elsewhere too, but no apparently this place is the best.</li><li>Unpopular opinion, but I did not like this place.</li><li>The place has the usual soon tofu, bibimbap and a soup/grilled bulgolgi.</li><li>The place is usually packed on weekends.</li><li>Under 3 stars for this place ?</li><li>2 pieces of the sushi were even spoiled- Go to Tako Sushi down the street ( Don Mills) This place was n't the best, but it was still okay!</li><li>The bad:- The teppanyaki chicken was a bit undercooked;- They charge for pop refills;- They twice forgot to bring out an appetizer our party had ordered ( and the place was n't even that busy)- Our cook told really bad misogynistic jokes.</li><li>If you do n't mind waiting ridiculous amounts of time, even when you 've made a reservation, while an unapologetic host ignores you then this is the place to go.</li><li>Working in Yorkville, this place is a lunch time staple and a welcome addition to the overpriced alternatives scattered throughout the Bay-Bloor area.</li><li>Chino Loco 's still KILLS, SLAUGHTERS actually, this place and the Church location is only a 15 min walk away.</li><li>Good place to go to satisfy a craving.</li><li>The place is kind of expensive I ordered spegetti and it was $ 15, a beer was $ 5, and it was n't all that great, I have n't had a lot of italian food but I have definitely had better.</li><li>Love this place.</li><li>This place is open till 11pm every day, popular with the locals, with a high noise level from all the different conversations going on around you.</li><li>I have to say I was NOT prepared for how amazing this place was.</li><li>But this location is a noisy, drafty place, not unlike an airport cafeteria, with bad music blaring loudly.</li><li>Good place to go.</li><li>The place is pretty nice and cozy.</li><li>Overall a great experience. i was sooo offended. as the manager of a bar, i understand some things take time, but being rudely greeted by the bar staff and ignored for 10 minutes while they do nothing is pretty bad to begin. having the barstaff whispering to each other while blatantly pointing at my friend is obscene. we asked to move to a table. they said fine, no one brought us menus or asked us if we wanted drinks. the bitchy blond bartender walked right by the table 4 times, making a point of not looking at us and cleaning tables right next to ours, yet still ignoring us. then she walked to the edge of the bar and twirled her hair for a bit, all the while making sure not to make eye contact with us. we finally went over to the bar and asked the guy if we could get menus or drinks or service, explaining to him that we have been waiting for ten minutes, when he rudely informed me that i had only been waiting 20 seconds. so i asked for the bill from our drink at the bar, had my tip rudely returned to me, amid more whispering and pointing at us. im disgusted and quite upset about being treated like that, especially because i used to be quite a regular there, and im a big tipper and very polite ( dont forget i manage a bar, and it should be all about customer service). i wouldnt recomend this place to anybody for any reason. maybe a different location, not this one.</li><li>This is THE place I go to for pasta.</li><li>One of the owners of this place ( Jim Treliving) also owns Mr. Lube and can be seen on the Canadian TV show on CBC Dragon 's Den.</li><li>AWESOME late nite/ 24 hr KALBI TANG or KAMJATANG place is a lil dirty, service is slow, but for 3 am yum at a decent price this place is the place to be in north york ( even though the selection of late night places in the area are very slim- subway is open till 3am across the street) i give them props for dealing with all the drunken stupers though, who roll in there wanting some home style korean! kimchi is very spicy! i choke everytime. hahaha, but they do give you as much as you want.</li><li>AWESOME late nite/ 24 hr KALBI TANG or KAMJATANG place is a lil

is very convenient when I want something quick.</li><li>With mini Korea Town ( Yonge and Finch area) being filled with Korean restaurants, this place is actually pretty cool.</li><li>I like this place because it does all 4 consistently.</li><li>Let me start off with saying that before I went to this place, i did n't really dabble my palate in Korean Food.</li><li>Love this place.</li><li>You can tell I really do n't like this place.</li><li>I recommend this place XD Love how they are open late ...... pork bone soup is so amazing after a night out!</li><li>Overall experience was an epic fail, from their un welcoming staff, there 's this old lady that was very rude, she did even bother to greet, their place is a mess, it stinks and their food is over priced compare to other korean restaurants thats clean, cozy and accomodating ..</li><li>The place is always packed so service is quick.</li><li>I still dream about it all the time since I live in Vancouver and I have n't found anything here that compares to it: ( The place did n't look very clean or inviting.</li><li>First and foremost, this place is open 24/7 so whether you are with your family or you are drunk with your friends, this place is 101 comfort food.</li><li>First and foremost, this place is open 24/7 so whether you are with your family or you are drunk with your friends, this place is 101 comfort food.</li><li>Food is served fast, the place is clean, there 's nothing remarkably good or bad.</li><li>The place could use a reno.</li><li>The place was busy on a Sunday afternoon and so that was a good sign.</li><li>The place was fun to be at but the food pretty much sucked.</li><li>Somehow within that 15 mins, this place was filled.</li><li>Granted, this place is very busy, so maybe I 'm missing something, but I 'm not the biggest fan of this place.</li><li>The place was busy but still had empty seats.</li><li>If you like the place, on your first visit buy a VIP card that is valid for 1 year and costs $ 20.</li><li>I 'm so disappointed because I love Asian Legend ( and other location but something happened today where some of the food was terrible and the service mediocre It was Sunday around 1:30pm and the place was pretty full.</li><li>The place is pretty much a dump or whole in the wall ... but is n't that what you want in a `` dive'' ... those are the best places for good food!</li><li>The place may look like a dive, but it just adds character!</li><li>The place defiantly has a lounge feel to it.</li><li>The place was shabby.</li><li>The place was packed and my friend thought the place is classy.</li><li>But if you are looking for dinner, this place is okay but not the best.</li><li>Great place to go on a first date or to catch with family.</li><li>Good place, and the only breakfast place in the area.</li><li>The place is not the cleanest diner I 've been to, and could definitely use an update.</li><li>We always order the CHICKEN PLACE SANDWICHES with EXTRA garlic mayo on the side.</li><li>The place, I believe, is run by a small group of Koreans, and they were real friendly.</li><li>If you 're a fan of this mix and match, you 'll probably like this place:) Actually the wonton and fish ball is good, but not for the beef.</li><li>This place is a hidden gem.</li><li>From first impression to the very last, this place was a zero!</li><li>The place looks poorly maintained, the tables who have finished eating and were long gone were cluttered with dishes and trash on the tables, even once the place was n't busy at all!</li><li>Long story short this place is a complete joke and I will never step foot in it again!</li><li>The place was kinda packed during rush hour and they did n't have enough waiter/waitress to serve everyone.</li><li>The place was clean with comfortable booths, so other than the service it had a nice ambiance to it.</li><li>I LOVE THIS PLACE!</li><li>Love this place.</li><li>OVERALL HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE FOOD IS REALLY GOOD!</li><li>This place is the best for lunch.</li><li>One noteworthy mention is their free side dishes; from all the Korean joints I 've been to, this place has the biggest selection of side dishes and they all taste pretty good.</li><li>The place is very clean with modern decor and the bathrooms are clean too.</li><li>This place is a nice and healthy change to the other fast food chains on the block.</li><li>Overall, this place was disappointing in flavour and in their customer service.</li><li>Foods good but the place was VERY busy.</li><li>Ambiance is weak and plaza/ neighbourhood is n't great which is probably why this place does n't get love.</li><li>Nonetheless, this place is a good find.</li><li>I was going to write a nasty review about how expensive this place is in comparison to other Persian restaurants around it but Trout 's right.</li><li>If you are looking for a quiet place to eat this is not your place to go.</li><li>I wanted to like this place because the service is friendly but the burgers are just not any good, especially for the price.</li><li>Sometime the place could use a bit better clean-up.</li><li>I 'm sorry, this place was disappointing just as their exterior restaurant design shows they do n't put much care or effort to running their business.</li><li>All You Can Eat Sushi places are great but this place does n't live up to the expectations of a vegetarian, your options will be very limited, I think I only had 5 things that I could actually eat from the menu.</li><li>If you 're into fancy looking sushi places with good food, this place is for you.</li><li>The place is clean and well kept.</li><li>The place was clean, the music was pleasant, and there was a lot of room.</li><li>The place is not big but they had 3 people working the floor and seemingly working each table.</li><li>Compared to some other noodle places near Yonge and Finch, this place is somewhat bigger ( I 'm talking on the scale of 25 seats vs 10), but it can fill up fast.</li><li>It 's a very small place but has a nice mom &amp; pop feel to it, you can tell immediately that this is a `` neighbourhood spot'' and the staff pretty much knew most of the customers dining in there by name.</li><li>The place is nice.</li><li>So if you are a fan as well this place is definitely worth checking out.</li><li>If you are looking for a real authentiic sushi restaurant with great sushi fish, this is the place to go.</li><li>Amongst a sea of Japanese restaurants in GTA, this place stands out by offering authentic Japanese fine dining, pure and clean Japanese food, none of the fusion/innovative rolls that you 'd find in so called sushi restaurants in trendy neighbourhoods.</li><li>The place is very clean and nice &amp; quiet.</li><li>I forgot about this place, but I used to come here a lot with I was kid, before the place became so pricey.</li><li>On a hot summer day, this place will be a little uncomfortable fro some to eat inside.</li><li>Nothing is particularly special though, so this place does n't make it to the four or five star mark.</li><li>In my starving state and driving past this place I swung in to get some take out.</li><li>After we ordered it took only 10 minutes for our food to be prepared, which is nice since the place is pretty small and not much to look at inside.</li><li>This place is a disgrace to Pizza Hut and I keep getting the impression that they are trying to cut corners everywhere.</li><li>For how expensive their pizzas are and after tipping them and paying extra for dine-in, this place does n't deliver on quality and value.</li><li>The pizza was truly amazing, however, I would have given this place 5 stars if the pizza had that extra tomato sauce as it honestly was a bit lacking.</li><li>The place did n't look too crowded at the time we arrived however I found it took a little while for the staff to notice us and seat us.</li><li>I actually really like this place!</li><li>3.5 STARS This place is a pretty good place to catch up with friends or have a first date.</li><li>Nice intimate place.</li><li>Nice place, nice ambiance and above all good food.</li><li>This place needs some serious improvements.</li><li>If you want a simple and causal but a place with nice decor, Symposium Cafe is where you go.</li><li>The food tasted as it always does .... but I 'll figure something else out next time! what is the deal with this mcdonalds ? i only go here because sometimes i work really late and its around the corner from my shop. they have the slowest service out of all mcdonalds ive ever been to. and on top of that, which i find ridiculous, they also charge more than other mcdonalds .. how ??? and when you get your order of fries, they NEVER fill it up, its always HALF. the food tastes as you would expect, but this place must be struggling financially to charge more than other mcdonalds, and only fill your fries HALF of what you should get. if you dont mind getting ripped off, then go here, otherwise go to the mconalds on keele just south of lawrence.</li><li>The place is small seat may be 10 people, take out is available, and all the backing is done on site.</li><li>Over all decent place but with a very limited menu.</li><li>I REALLY want to like this place but I really .. do n't We sat on the patio and it boasted `` authentic'' memphis style bbq. ... but then again, what place does n't try to boast authenticity nowadays ?</li><li>The place was plain but clean.</li><li>Contrary to the other reviews, I like this place.</li><li>But the pork was not smoked. this place did n't deliver the goods unfortunately.</li><li>Love their cornbread Not surprisingly, this place is closed ...</li><li>The place is small and cozy but able to accommodate larger groups when needed.</li><li>The place is designed more for pairs than larger groups.</li><li>The place was not too busy so it was a nice dining experience for us with servers ' full attention on us, but I left wondering why was this place not as popular as I expected it would be ?</li><li>It 's a small place, and so they may not be able to accommodate parties of more than six at one table.</li><li>-Decor is outstanding- Would n't expect such a beautiful place when looking on the outside- Service was awesome- Love the secluded sitting area As far as sushi restaurants go that are n't AYCE and $ 100/meal, this place tops it.</li><li>The place is n't too big and gets quite busy during lunch hours so go in the late afternoon ( lunch menu ends at 4pm by the way).</li><li>From the first moment you walk in, you can tell, this place is quality and the people care.</li><li>The place is very small and if you go during busy times you may wind up waiting quite a while.</li><li>I will recommend this place to any poor soul who works in the area or goes to York, as it is by far the best sushi option in the area.</li><li>It 's a very small place, the decor is welcoming and the staff very attentive.</li><li>So idk what they meant by `` we take our customers opinion very seriously''. just wondered has this happened to anyone before ? been left on the phone I 've given this place a few tries but they always seem to be understaffed.</li><li>Great place to go for watching sports.</li><li>The place was jam packed and we literally got the last table.</li><li>Our server was very nice and even though the place was busy checked on us time to time.</li><li>Their Klondike chili is decent ( $ 7.49 with fries, $ 5.49 without), their cocktails are good, and I love their nachos with jalapenos, it 's really spicy and perfect for sharing while watching the game on their many tv screens ( $ 11.99) Good place, solid food and good service we go there a lot for UFC nights but try to go to the bar upstairs much better atmosphere than the ground floor, better service and even the food.</li><li>Always friendly service and well executed dishes in a dated but comfortable environment, this place will be missed ( especially the pickles).</li><li>Yes, the place could use a renovation, plastic cups for sauces etc have to go.</li><li>The place is a little bit in need of an update; the decor is not bad or worn out, but the patterned carpet just makes it feel dated.</li><li>I really like this place.</li><li>The place was bustling with people and the restaurant looked clean, modern and spacious.</li><li>The warm colored interior and slightly dimed lights created a cozy atmosphere, even though the place was almost packed and somewhat loud.</li><li>Huge place, has a buffet and ala cart; but never packed ??</li><li>The place is extremely dirty, the food is questionably and definitely microwaved, and the servers did n't have their customer service training.</li><li>What a shame ..... and yes, the place was pretty empty ( Tuesday afternoon) This place needs to go back into its past &amp; rethink everything, what happened to that happy, light hearted atmosphere that was Wimpy 's ? ..... they went 99% of the distance with the decor .... but seriously, why unplug the Jukebox setup; really dumb- ( uh that kinda was the whole idea of having it there ....</li><li>Overall, if you are craving low quality diner food that is overpriced for what you are getting, this is the place to go.</li><li>The place is a diner so do n't expect a posh atmosphere.</li><li>The place was crazy-ass busy at the time, and there was a line-up out the door, but it was clear that this manager was keeping it together upstairs, and was calm and in control.</li><li>I was surprised to see how busy this place was, and it appears to have a committed group of locals that come here regularly.</li><li>I like this place, it 's small however so timing is important in order to get a table.</li><li>The Highlights:- This place is gorgeous both inside and out- Ample amount of seating for both small and big groups- The waiters are all very professional and seasoned in the food serving business ( you wo n't find your neighbor 's 16 year old kid working here)- Free hors d' oeuvres at the start of your meal ( pickles, olives, cottage cheese, and garlic bread)- Reasonable prices ( all main entrees come with a salad or soup of the day ... a good amount too)- Parking is a plenty and free- Desserts are made on site and delicious ... and you can get it for a low price- Bottomless coffee for $ 1.75- Quiet so you can carry on a conversation with your dining companions I will definitely be back.</li><li>The place had a very romantic era feel to it.</li><li>First of all, this place is lovely.</li><li>And the ambiance and decor make it an interesting place to bring people who have never been.</li><li>The place also has barbaque but I doubt that I would want that late at night ..</li><li>Overall, this place was alright.</li><li>A nice place to go when you 're out late, but not sure I 'd head to such a busy area when there is Korean food closer to home.</li><li>Seems like this place is good for table cooking but we were n't up for that.</li><li>The place was busy actually with customers.</li><li>This place is a classic example of where expectations are set but not met.</li><li>Service plays an integral role and from my consumer opinion, this place is understaffed and the poor service is a result of that.</li><li>Normally, if I 'm heading out for Korean food, I go to Nak Won next door or Narooe up the street but since I had n't tried this place yet, I figured I 'd give it a go.</li><li>However, this place was something of a mixed bag.</li><li>The place was very clean.</li><li>Edit: price wise, this place is only worth it during weekdays for lunch ( 12.99 as of 2014), but I 'd probably not pay 26 for dinner at this place.</li><li>The place is clean and modern with attentive waitresses who are always quick to clear finished plates and refill our drinks.</li><li>I like this place.</li><li>Good place to go for communal eating ( order a bunch and share among).</li><li>The place had never been renovated EVER!</li><li>Love this place!</li><li>Love this place!</li><li>The place is loud, so be prepared to use your outside voice.</li><li>However, this place is always busy ... should make reservation if you do n't want to wait in line.</li><li>This place is pretty awesome.</li><li>Ok, I 've been trying to call this place to order takeout food as I 've done a ton of times before as they deliver.</li><li>The place was clean and lastly, the meal was inexpensive!</li><li>Love this place.</li><li>I had high hopes for this place and was excited upon seeing and tasting my congee when it arrived.</li><li>The place gets incredibly busy at night because they are open late.</li><li>If you are in a rush and can get a seat, this place is fast!</li><li>Overall, this place is A-OK, I would come back all the time just for cake!</li><li>When I 'm back in town, this place is a must for their meringue.</li><li>Cute cafe:) We came here just to grab some cakes to go so did n't stay, but definitely roomy enough to be a nice sit-down place.</li><li>This is my local place to order Chinese.</li><li>All in all, for cheap and quick food with good portions and decent flavours, this place is certainly worth a try if you 're in the neighbourhood.</li><li>This place does n't have thE best bagels in the world, but there are a few key items which are fantastic- combined with friendly and polite counter service.</li><li>Love this place.</li><li>When I got there, the place was pretty empty.</li><li>Love this place.</li><li>The place was super busy on a Sunday and the Line did not stop.</li><li>This place is a hidden treasure that I am happy my friend found.</li><li>Great place, great food, never disappointed and the price is cheap.</li><li>Out of all the ramen places that have opened recently in the GTA, this place is still my favourite!</li><li>I really like this place!</li><li>Very small place, less than 10 tables.</li><li>It 's a really small place, so big groups might want to call ahead and make sure it 's not too busy.</li><li>I 'd say this is the place to go for Ramen time.</li><li>The place was slightly tiny, so it was hard to get a nice seat away from the other people in the place.</li><li>The place is usually way too busy for one waitress ( even though it is quite small) and she ( usually a she) is always super stressed.</li><li>I usually went to other one@4860 Yonge St I always ordered fired noodle also so great Nice place, good ramen.</li><li>This place is open late for the club goers and drunks who have late night munchies.</li><li>Look no further, this is the place to be.</li><li>Just ask for whatever you want because some toppings are hidden due to space, so do n't be shy. can you tell i love this place ? lol I 've got three basic rules that have made me the singular successful guy I am and have kept me in the running to be a Darwinian success.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
