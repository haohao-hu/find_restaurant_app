<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 58' %><h2>waitresses<br />occurrence: 115</h2><div><ol><li>We had 3 different waitresses throughout our stay, which I found to be a bit odd, but all of them were friendly none-the-less.</li><li>Many waitresses passed by us doing nothing.</li><li>The waitresses are really friendly and the food is decent.</li><li>I thought about my experience when I was actually a customer here, and I regret that I did not use the washroom when I could:) Kindly I suggest you guys finish your business before paying or the waitresses would not allow your entry into the washroom:) For me, I will never give them a sh* t though:) Well, then talk about my CUSTOMER experience here.</li><li>Then I noticed that all of the waitresses here were wearing booty shorts, in December.</li><li>When you order enough sake, you might be treated to something special that 's off menu;) The waitresses know their sake and can make a recommendation for you.</li><li>When they put us into the private room area, I did n't even felt we are being segregate from the rest of the crowd, the waitresses are super friendly and attend to all our needs before we lift a finger.</li><li>I have to admit that the waitresses are quite attractive -- but I 'll let you be the judge of that.</li><li>I was seated quickly, had my order taken promptly, and the waitresses kept coming back to make sure the food was alright.</li><li>We had a private room at the back of the restaurant, which was a really nice touch, and were still checked in on very regularly by the waitresses to fill up our water glasses, etc.</li><li>Service is always friendly, the waitresses are really sweet.</li><li>The waitresses are friendly and even laughed at the banters between my date and I. There was a manager on floor who looked like he was keeping a close eye on customers ' needs.</li><li>They even feature cute looking waitresses in black skirts and tight dresses, which seem to be a common theme at Asian-inspired restaurants in the area! ( Nome Izakaya, Moxies `` feature'' similar wardrobe for their servers too.)</li><li>Once in a while your steak may come out not as ordered, they are usually good about fixing it for you, some waitresses like to make it personal and give you some attitude, remember its their tip they are losing so ignore them.</li><li>Customers near us were telling us to just leave at this point but the waitresses said the food was coming and they were very busy in the kitchen.</li><li>The waitresses know my family now so they always reserve a corner booth for us.</li><li>The waitresses were attentive and the food came from the kitchen fast enough.</li><li>This almost comes across as racist, &amp; I assure you it is n't, but the waitresses need to learn English.</li><li>The waitresses seemed to continue to converse amongst themselves and were on their phone with their backs to us but I guess seeing as the place was completely empty, they had nothing else to do.</li><li>You 'll be greeted by waitresses dressed in kimono.</li><li>She told me the girl wearing black was the hostess, the waitresses are in the collared shirt, and she wore whatever she liked because she was the manager.</li><li>The waitresses arent naturally smiley ( resting bitch face syndrome ?) but they 're friendly and efficient and do smile on occasion which in my mind is just as good!</li><li>The waitresses are usually older and very friendly.</li><li>When we asked to split it halfway, one of the waitresses said `` well, you know tips are also expected ..''</li><li>Prices are fair, waitresses are quick and friendly, always provide water with lemon, mint.</li><li>Make your decision before ordering or the waitresses will be too busy to wait for you and will come back later.</li><li>It was super busy but the 2 waitresses did their best to attend to every table 's pots and grills.</li><li>The waitresses are mostly young students, but very polite and professional.</li><li>Anyways i had a great experience and i will be coming back another time. food is great servers are not. although our dishes were constantly brought out and picked up promptly the servers would throw dishes on to the table and even the bill as if they are giving food to dogs ... the food was delicious but too bad the waitresses had to ruin the experience.</li><li>The waitresses and waiters removed the empty dishes quickly.</li><li>All the Sinchon Food 's waitresses kept speaking Korean to me then finally realized all I understand were welcome and thank you and good bye and you are cute ....</li><li>They use the tablet for ordering which helps speed up the delivery of food and frees up the waitresses.</li><li>We have to chase about the waitresses for water and tea ... for 6 of us we were only give this 1/2 litre wine jug of hot tea and cold water ... hey we are also eating spicy food!</li><li>Its over priced .. extremely over priced .. and the waitresses DO NOT GET TO KEEP THEIR TIPS .. which is illegal ..</li><li>The waitresses are rude and grumpy and are unwilling to listen to requests.</li><li>The waitresses there looked unhappy to be there.</li><li>The waitresses are distracted and consistenly mildly patronizing ( in a bad way).</li><li>Other older waitresses were very polite, though.</li><li>Service is always good and the waitresses are always smiling.</li><li>The waitresses were not that attentive.</li><li>Well, I gave this place 5 stars for its friendly waitresses, variety/ quality of dishes.</li><li>The only negative thing I have to say is that, about five years ago, one of the waitresses was really obnoxious.</li><li>Went in sat down watched the waitresses chat with each other for 15 minutes.</li><li>The waitresses I 've talked to are Iraqi and Egyptian.</li><li>Despite our attempts to get some ' intel' on what to expect from the `` Southern Fried Chicken Sliders,'' the waitresses recommendation was quite disappointing.</li><li>The place is definitely under-staffed and it 's definitely not the waiters and waitresses faults for not being up to par with service.</li><li>I also ordered the Taiwanese sausage rice with tea egg ... the taste is pretty authentic. the service was slow but the waitresses were attentive.</li><li>Our table is in the far corner, kinda where the waitresses ca n't see you, nor do they ever come by.</li><li>The immediate vibe from the waitresses was that they were busy as a mofo.</li><li>The waitresses there are also very polite and considerate.</li><li>The waitresses helped mix the chicken with the cheese and noodles, however she had to bring the cooking table away from us as our table was too small.</li><li>Hearty comfort food for me! n the mash potato side dish is so yummy too! towards the end when u only have a bit of chicken n pieces of veggies left in ur pan, you can ask them to make fried rice with it. they will bring over rice, hot sauce/sesame oil mixture n mix it all up for u. the owner lady even formed the rice into a heart shape for me n my boyfriend one time. it was too cute ~! the Dak Gal Bee is so good there, every time we go that 's all we get. so i do n't know how the other items on the menu taste. oh and the minimum order for Dak Gal Bee is 2 people portions. service is fine, waitresses are pleasant, but sometimes do n't speak much English, but who cares, food 's good!</li><li>Pros:- very nice waitresses- they have booths with grills designed in the table ( uber cool)- novelty idea: the waitresses cook right at your table ( if you 're sitting in a booth)!</li><li>Pros:- very nice waitresses- they have booths with grills designed in the table ( uber cool)- novelty idea: the waitresses cook right at your table ( if you 're sitting in a booth)!</li><li>Cons:- if you 're seated on tables, you do n't get to see the waitresses cook in front of you.</li><li>Holy geez, I 've never seen a pair of waitresses work as hard as the two that we had.</li><li>It was kinda creepy because four waiters and waitresses surrounded our table with the duck and started cutting it up.</li><li>As others have said, the waitresses do n't have the greatest English skills, but surprisingly, one of the waitresses speaks decent Mandarin.</li><li>As others have said, the waitresses do n't have the greatest English skills, but surprisingly, one of the waitresses speaks decent Mandarin.</li><li>There is even a button on each table to ring in the waitresses, which I thought was pretty cute and convenient.</li><li>However, the waitresses kinda mixed up our table and did not serve us.</li><li>Will definitely be coming back to try the crab dish! not quite too sure why this place is so popular. first warning: the waitresses have difficulty with english. this problem was quite apparent the moment we stepped in and asked for a table of four--she pointed at various tables and said things while pointing at them ... and I 'm pretty sure I heard korean, english, and mandarin all thrown in the mix. we wandered around the ( small!) restaurant from table to table as she pointed, confused about where she wanted us to sit. eventually we snagged one of the side booths ( luckily! it looks like the tables are really small, crowded and uncomfortable) but it took them a few minutes to clear off the booth table. even after we sat, we noticed big spills in the middle of the table that had been missed. it took forever to order. the waitresses never came around. when we tried to ask questions about the menu, she just gave us the chinese version ( not particularly helpful, but we had a fun time cross-referencing the korean and chinese like some second-rate linguists). we finally ordered and the side dishes came ... with one spoon short ( ?). we asked for more spoons and more tea three times before they came back with a huge pitcher of tea and abundance of spoons and napkins ... well, I guess that 's effective.</li><li>Will definitely be coming back to try the crab dish!

portions here are really generous. the workers and waitresses are also really nice. for the people who are complaining about how the workers are ( ie rolliing the dirty dishes around etc) ... thats typically a normal vietnamese resturant for you. if u think this is dirty then u should not go to vietnam lol. but anywho, food here is really good. my parents go here every other day or so cos its close to their work and i also know a friend who eats here everyday too just cause he loves it. the pho, rice, and bun mam is really yummy. also my aunt is obssessed with their viet coffee as she says its authentic since there is so much flavour! also really cheap too:) oh yeah its cash only ... i think by now its safe to say if u go anywhere asian, just have cash with u cos chances are they are not going to take debit or credit!</li><li>On a side note ... the waitresses are really cute;).</li><li>Whenever I 've come to this location I have n't had to wait that long for seating and the waitresses are n't pushy or come bother you all the time- they leave you alone and are pretty friendly.</li><li>The service was a bit un-attentive, but our server was nice and it did seem like the waitresses were pretty stretched out between al the tables, but the service did n't really get any better when the place started clearing out later into the meal so take that as you will.</li><li>The service was terrible; it was slow and the waitresses are not friendly and do not take their time to answer your questions.</li><li>However, I do not blame them so much for their service; for a big restaurant, two waitresses is far too little; I blame the owner for not hiring more people.</li><li>So the bell is kind of pointless ... the place is clearly understaffed ( 2 waitresses for a full restaurant on a Saturday lunch).</li><li>The service was terrible, we were not offered tea or water and waitresses did not respond to our calls.</li><li>I stood there for about 3 minutes, waiting for the waitresses to come out and point me to a table but I just gave up and sat myself down.</li><li>There 's always that button for you to press but sometimes the waitresses can completely disregard the little ringing noise so you 'll have to flag them down.</li><li>I just want to ring it till one of the waitresses comes in and yell at me so I can have some services!</li><li>The waitresses were all uninterested, rude and annoyed, they ignored us multiple times when we asked for them, and when we asked to pay separately, they sucked their teeth at us.</li><li>Service is n't amazing but is n't horrible, waitresses are fluent in Korean and Mandarin! 1 or 2 of the waitresses are fluent in English the rest have a basic understanding.</li><li>Service is n't amazing but is n't horrible, waitresses are fluent in Korean and Mandarin! 1 or 2 of the waitresses are fluent in English the rest have a basic understanding.</li><li>We were waiting to be seated at the entrance and not even once did any of the waitresses acknowledged me and my friend 's presence.</li><li>The waitresses ignored us for a good ten minutes before getting our orders.</li><li>The only downside is the rude attitude of the waitresses here.</li><li>They sort of have some waitresses that are responsible for your tables.</li><li>Food took forever to come .. my friend had to ask one of the waitresses if the food on the ledge was ours because it was sitting there for 10 min. The waiter was confused about our bill and had to reprint it 3 times.</li><li>The only thing you should be worried about is the price and if it 's really busy because the waitresses often get overwhelmed ...</li><li>The waitresses wore kimonos and they were all very courteous.</li><li>He then proceeded to tell the waitresses Guess Who 's Coming to Dinner- it was a BIG family reunion of sorts.</li><li>For the most part, the waiters &amp; waitresses are good and the service is good.</li><li>Did I mention the waitresses were pretty hot ?</li><li>Service was really good, the waitresses came by to check on us and refill any drinks we needed.</li><li>We waited for over 5 mins at the entrance with another 10 people while the 4 waitresses joked, ate toast, checked lottery tickets and were hanging out at the bar.</li><li>Then I saw one of the waitresses standing behind the cash register in the narrow aisle texting on her cell phone while I was directly in front of her without being served !!!</li><li>But mostly given a poor rating because I completely agree about the terrible attitude of some of the ( older) waitresses.</li><li>There were 4 tables in there that night, and 6 waitresses and a few busboys etc.</li><li>We were so pissed, we left them $ 96 on a $ 95.89 bill and left with the waitresses eyes glaring at us in disbelief.</li><li>The place is clean and modern with attentive waitresses who are always quick to clear finished plates and refill our drinks.</li><li>The waitresses know me as a regular, and yet the consistently the apathetic quality of service never fails to frustrate me.</li><li>The food is superb &amp; the waitresses are some of the friendliest we 've ever had.</li><li>Prices are reasonable and the waitresses are always friendly.</li><li>I believe the restaurant is family owned, and the waitresses are all very nice ladies with very good customer service skills.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
