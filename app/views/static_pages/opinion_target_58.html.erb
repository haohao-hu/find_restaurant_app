ideal for a brunch ambiance.</li><li>I guess the restaurant also shares that with the demographic in the area- as the furniture and ambiance were excellent.</li><li>Kiyomizu itself is decorated beautifully- there are small strings of lights placed across the restaurant which create an elegant ambiance ( think quiet and intimate, relative to the sports bar feel of Sushi Moto), and the booths are cozy and comfortable.</li><li>There are also more booths in the upper level that are slightly closed off by beautiful drapes, and it all makes for a very warm, inviting and cozy ambiance.</li><li>Ambiance: 2-3 stars.</li><li>Take-out service was fast and the ambiance and staff were so welcoming.</li><li>It 's cozy with a nice romantic ambiance.</li><li>Good quality and good

Overall: 3.5 Extra information:* Many items for 2 people minimum* 2 locations ( North York &amp; Christie)* Vegetarian option Avail I love table-top cooked dishes, they are the best because you share same thing with everyone ... which means no crying over who ordered a better dish.</li><li>While the ambiance and service of the restaurant are average at best, I always return to eat their baked pork cutlet on rice ( joo pah fan).</li><li>The ambiance was really good and the waiter was good at suggesting us dishes.</li><li>Went in and the place looks cozy and has ambiance.</li><li>And with that, the ambiance was destroyed.</li><li>The place itself is very romantic inside with a very intimate and dim setting with a quiet ambiance.</li><li>We did find the place a little noisy, but it was

ambiance.</li><li>The Ambiance is perfect for a Thai restaurant.</li><li>Plus the décor and ambiance was great.</li><li>The place has really nice ambiance and service but I find the food over priced for the quality.</li><li>The decor and ambiance are very classy with Buddhist sculptures and beautiful orchids.</li><li>Although Salad King is not for the faint of heart ( like eating your meal in a train station) the ambiance at Linda is quite nice!</li><li>While the ambiance is dark and cozy, the food was very quite modified to suite the typical North American palate.</li><li>The décor is kitschy but I was n't there for the ambiance.</li><li>If you are looking for elegance, ambiance or other intangibles, keep looking.</li><li>Would be five stars if the service, and ambiance stepped up it 's game.</li><li>But putting ambiance aside, the service is still as personable as ever and the food is still great.</li><li>If you expect high end, modern, fancy, trendy ambiance, this place isnt for you.</li><li>And on a hot August day in Toronto the food and ambiance had me feeling that I was no longer in Canada.</li><li>While its founders originated from Congee Wong, it has already

restaurants for the customer service or ambiance.</li><li>The ambiance is perfect for a snowy, miserable night.</li><li>I had a delicious bubble tea here and the ambiance is really nice.</li><li>The ambiance here is quite nice with decorated walls and nice wooden chairs sort of like a `` Chinese Tea'' theme going on.</li><li>Now I said there were 3 main things to look for, ambiance, service and noise level but I 'd like to mention one other thing with Ten Ren.</li><li>Sometimes I even dine in and it 's also confortable though it is ideal for take out as it is a fast service and a small ambiance!</li><li>Sushi Bong is a small place mainly for take out, there is no ambiance or atmosphere or fancy wooden boats to serve sushi.</li><li>Excellent and unique food, savory noodles, excellent ambiance.</li><li>The service is usually efficient, the ambiance is modern and the restaurant is physically clean.</li><li>Its ambiance is very attractive and is good for a date too.</li><li>Ambiance .... no Cleanliness .... questionable Mediocre Americanized Chinese food ...... check This place is a large run down looking resto with a friendly Chinese staff.</li><li>It 's a small store that can only fit up to 20 people, but the ambiance is casual and lighting was bright.</li><li>But for those who seek for real quality dessert and relaxing ambiance- there are better out there!</li><li>The food was 3/5 and ambiance gets 0/5.</li><li>Liked the ambiance of the bakery.</li><li>Do n't come to this place hungry .... or thirsty ... yes, the ambiance has the eye candy looks ... all manner of delicacies displayed and cooked for you ... ala time-share.</li><li>Ambiance: Great decor, but very typical `` Japanese'' style, with wood everywhere.</li><li>We sat back, enjoyed our pints of Keith 's and the ambiance and waited.</li><li>Expect a line up at this family-run brunch spot- the ambiance definitely has a `` diner'' feel to it and the menu options offer more than the average brunch place.</li><li>Ambiance was nice, service was odd, place was very tight and crowded, food was served luke-warm.</li><li>The ambiance is comfy and they have two TVs on which kind of reminded me of a pub instead of a sushi place ?</li><li>Ambiance is nothing to write home about.</li><li>Inside, the decor is very nice and classy, I enjoyed the mosaic and the ambiance was just lovely.</li><li>I regret that everything aside from the ambiance and prompt service is absolutely horrific.</li><li>The ambiance is great and has a lot of character.</li><li>The ambiance is nice and casual too, a bit on the noisy side but that 's because they are extremely busy.</li><li>Ambiance: Casual and fairly noisy, considering that the restaurant was not even full yet.</li><li>Food 1.0/5 Service 2.0/5 Ambiance 1.0/5 Value 4.0/5 = = = = = = = = = Overall 1.30/5.</li><li>Decor not the greatest and they have those vintage arcade games which I do n't think even work anymore but get takeout if you do n't appreciate the ambiance.</li><li>The Ambiance: The ambiance is great.</li><li>The Ambiance: The ambiance is great.</li><li>+ 10 for ambiance.</li><li>Delicious does not consider the ambiance of the restaurant, the level of service from the staff or the prices.</li><li>Where they have wonderful food, service and ambiance.</li><li>The place was clean with comfortable booths, so other than the service it had a nice ambiance to it.</li><li>You 're not going here for the ambiance.</li><li>Ambiance is weak and plaza/ neighbourhood is n't great which is probably why this place does n't get love.</li><li>I do n't like the ambiance.</li><li>There are other Iranian restaurants close by which serve better food in a much nicer ambiance with better price.</li><li>Great spot for take out as ambiance in restaurant is lacking.</li><li>I can see why a lot of people like to come here, the ambiance is very reminiscent of really old dim sum places I used to visit in Hong Kong.</li><li>Stepping in, you can tell it 's one of those pretentious places w/ nice decor &amp; ambiance which simply means ... we look authentic &amp; can jack up prices &amp; even more so since it 's part of the Westin Prince Hotel.</li><li>Service deserves 5 stars, ambiance 4 stars, food 3.5 stars and that leaves us with an overall score of 4/5.</li><li>Ambiance.</li><li>I wish someone had given me the same advise, saving me $ 200, an evening of terrible food, and crappy ambiance.</li><li>The ambiance is also really nice.</li><li>This place is newly opened, with a beautiful Renaissance mural interior, cozy chairs, and great ambiance.</li><li>I like the patio space and the ambiance.</li><li>Nice place, nice ambiance and above all good food.</li><li>Great new spot in my hood with such warm ambiance great for families or friends for dinner, coffee, dessert or all of the above.</li><li>I 'll likely forget about the meal I had here as there was n't anything truly exquisite about the flavour, service or ambiance.</li><li>Customer service is adequate and the ambiance is inviting for large groups.</li><li>Service and ambiance is top notch.</li><li>It is a little on the pricey side, but the ambiance is very nice.</li><li>It 's the type of spot that older people would love- very traditional- but the service, ambiance and decor make it a perfect date spot.</li><li>And the ambiance and decor make it an interesting place to bring people who have never been.</li><li>My bf had taken me to David Duncan House for a surprise anniversary dinner, and I was very impressed with the excellent service, quality of dishes, and the beautiful appearance of the outside as well as the warm and intimate ambiance inside.</li><li>In my opinion, Congee Queen has surpassed them in food quality, restaurant capacity, and ambiance.</li><li>The ambiance was clean, the lighting was bright, and the menu was large.</li><li>Food- 5/5 Service- take out but 5/5 Ambiance- 2/5 Price to value ratio: 4.5/5. soft bread, crispy bacons, shredded crispy lettuce, huge size .. very good price, for such a nice sandwich, turkey bacon is my favorite, it going to be a regular lunch place for me for sure!</li></ol></div><ul
