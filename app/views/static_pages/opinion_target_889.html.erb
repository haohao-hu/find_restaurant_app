<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 889' %><h2>minced pork<br />occurrence: 5</h2><div><ol><li>Green Beans with minced pork was very bland and definitely could have used more salt.</li><li>The minced pork was dried up and lacked any nice kick to it.</li><li>The minced pork was n't so minced, but the flavour was there.</li><li>I like the food here, especially the chicken cutlet ( tender &amp; tasty), the deep fried fish ( generous portion and never fishy ... you know what I mean!) and the Taiwanese sausage ( can be ordered on it 's own or comes with the minced pork on rice with tea egg.)</li><li>Chiu Chow Congee ( Dried Fish, Oyster Dices, Minced Pork) although not flavourful soup as others, it also means less saltiness which is a positive comment.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
