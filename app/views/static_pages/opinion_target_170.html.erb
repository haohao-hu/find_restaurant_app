<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 170' %><h2>servings<br />occurrence: 39</h2><div><ol><li>Pros:- Low price, large servings- Staffs are friendly Cons:- Not authentic for their Japanese dishes.</li><li>I really enjoyed the food and we were given gigantic servings of fish.</li><li>The servings here are quite large- expect to be filled, and them some!</li><li>They have a lot of wok options, the servings are n't that big so you can try everything !!!</li><li>Decent servings and fast service.</li><li>It 's still a cute place to hang out w/ friends though. service, food, everything was great--especially the atmosphere. super cosy and easily my ( and many of my friends ') favourite cafe in the area try out the cinnamon honey brick bread and their bingsoo! this is the only cafe so far in toronto that serves shaved milk ( instead of regular water which makes it extra creamy and delicious). their servings are always very large so going with a friend is recommended but not necessary. if you 're looking for drinks, their sweet potato latte is the best I 've had in toronto and as for cold drinks, all of their bubble teas are very nice would definitely recommend to try out for anyone in the area.</li><li>They have really good meat on their burgers and servings for everything is always generous!</li><li>Around 2years ago was my last visit here and I can say that the good taste is still the same although I have 4stars because the servings got smaller and as always it 's congested.</li><li>The servings were HUGE- definitely worth the value!</li><li>They 're very generous on their servings.</li><li>The servings were large coming with salted rice ( effing delicious), salad and 2 burritos with huge dollops of guacamole and sour cream on top.</li><li>Very generous servings.</li><li>There are times I will buy 3 or 4 servings and keep them in the fridge so I can have one each day.</li><li>We found the servings to be small, even the share plates.</li><li>A few reasons to love Mr. Jerk- great flavor- great prices ( chicken and pork combo for 10 $ that 's good enough for 2 people)- great sides ( plantains, coleslaw, and chili all mesh well together)- large servings- gravy and rice are awesome I always order take-out and the worst part of the experience is the drive home hungry while the aroma of the grilled chicken fills the car.</li><li>Servings were n't as much as other places and price is just the same if not higher.</li><li>Oh yeah, the servings are HUGE, but the leftovers are great for lunch the next day!</li><li>The servings are pretty big, and the service is more friendly that China Town and just as fast, if not more quick.</li><li>I usually do n't send back servings to the kitchen ( maybe because I 'm a bit shy when it comes to that), so I just accepted it and tried to finish my rice soup and chicken.</li><li>The servings included a bowl of rice plus all the usual condiments you would expect from a Korean restaurant, including the fried Korean pancakes.</li><li>We ordered three servings for the chicken Dak Gal Bee.</li><li>The portion is pretty good, 2 servings can feed about 3 people, but it 's a minimum of 2 for the Dak Gal Bee.</li><li>Catch is, you have to order a minimum of 2 `` servings''.</li><li>I liked their variety of vegetables and the fact that the servings were appropriate considering how many people we were.</li><li>Their servings are always good for the price.</li><li>Made with care and served in generous servings.</li><li>Servings were a lot though, which is a good point, but I do n't quite understand why there is extra whip cream on the side when there is already ( a good amount of) whip cream inside the crepe.</li><li>Prices are cheap considering the servings.</li><li>They are usually not fresh and have very small servings.</li><li>Ah mandarin, where you eat 5x the servings you normally would in a day and are full of regret by the end of your meal.</li><li>It was delicious and the servings were huge.</li><li>ALL of these things were listed on the menu ... they also seem very stinge with everything. servings are small ... which could be a good thing ... i ordered beef sashimi .. that must be the most horrifying color i have ever seen ... it looked like rotting corpse from the walking dead color. just looked wrong .. please see pics. ordered the beef ribs ... it came out jet black burnt ... see pic. why would you bother serving it ? it makes no sense. the dude left a paper on our table and did not take the order, so i brought it to the front since i was going to the washroom ... he then gives me a lecture saying dont give orders to the front desk. i wouldnt have to if your service was better. water was never filled once. the only reason this place gets 2 star is because they had red tuna as a sashimi choice. which btw came out two different colors .. one time it was red .. the second time i ordered it was light pink ... i suspect they gave me F grade fish the second time around.</li><li>Large servings.</li><li>I really enjoyed the side dishes, which had a really great variety, but kind of small servings.</li><li>Absolutely delicious and massive servings.</li><li>It is a really comfortable place for sushi and the waiters and waitress has really good servings ( it 's really fast).</li><li>They only had one waiter so we would always steal the menu from the other tables in order to get some extra servings.</li><li>I checked their online menu, there are individual servings available.</li><li>The hollandaise sauce was made perfectly and the servings were large ...</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
