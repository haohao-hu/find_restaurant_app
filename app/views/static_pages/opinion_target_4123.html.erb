<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 4123' %><h2>sweet cruller rice noodle rolls<br />occurrence: 1</h2><div><ol><li>The food is good, but not worth the teeny portion size they give you. ... while i 've always known this place existed, it 's hard for me to remember that it 's there to try it out. located in a plaza on don mills but you ca n't really see the storefront and if you 're not looking for it you 'll drive by it completely. finally we got dinner takeout as we were searching on yelp. we ordered: live whole lobster with efu noodles- excellent. yeung chow fried rice- good, but the peas were slightly undercooked. sweet cruller rice noodle rolls, good. stir fried beef with vegetables, good. deep fried squid tentacles, good. fried turnip patties Singapore style, mediocre. sweet and sour pork, excellent. the food was great, the prices are definitely cheaper than congee queen. all of that for $ 70, and they deliver for orders over $ 25- which i did n't know until we picked up the food. love delivery, especially for the winter- will definitely return!</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
