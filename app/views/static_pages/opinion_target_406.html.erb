<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 406' %><h2>olive oil<br />occurrence: 9</h2><div><ol><li>And no olive oil!</li><li>Butternut Squash Soup- nice and hot, yellow squash soup with drizzle of olive oil and pumpkin seeds for added texture Spaghetti Puttanesca- great al dente pasta in tomato, slightly spicy sauce, with olives and capers ( no anchovies!)</li><li>Bread with balsamic and olive oil was brought to the table.</li><li>Water is pre-poured ( germaphobes beware ?), and the bread basket, with olive spread, butter, olive oil and balsamic are also preset at the table.</li><li>The bread we were served was not made in house and we did not get olive oil and vinegar with it but butter which was unusual and disappointing at an Italian restaurant.</li><li>Overall it was more like a cream sauce than pesto, so if you 're looking for an olive oil based pesto sauce, this is not it.</li><li>An Artisan loaf with a little olive oil and perhaps some balsamic vinegar would have been a nicer touch ... and in my opinon, not too much to ask for.</li><li>They covered it up by drizzling copious amounts of olive oil!</li><li>2- 2.5 stars from me Good: Potato Pizza, but you need to add some fresh garlic or onions, otherwise it is much much too bland- just potato and a touch of rosemary, with no other seasoning and barely a hint of olive oil.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
