<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 415' %><h2>shrimp tempura<br />occurrence: 9</h2><div><ol><li>The shrimp tempura taste strange like the shrimp is dried inside.</li><li>Their shrimp tempura comes with some veggies, which is a great touch in my opinion.</li><li>For example, the chicago, Yoko, and spider rolls were only distinguished by the shrimp tempura, unagi, and the soft-shell crab respectively, but there was no way you could tell the difference when all you could taste was the sweetness of the sauce ( which was made even worse by the fact that the yam is also very very prominent and sweet.</li><li>The shrimp tempura was nice and crispy and fried to perfection.</li><li>The shrimp tempura that we ordered were nice and crispy while also feeling light.</li><li>Portions were a lot smaller than the price suggested, especially for the shrimp tempura.</li><li>The shrimp tempura was amazing!</li><li>Completely ruined our night ... whats worst is that we did n't even get an apology ... food is actually not that bad. the shrimp tempura was excellent. the waiting staff was atrocious. super slow and just brain dead. the only person who cleaned our table was the manager! the desert menu is very small. the also did not have a lot of the stuff that was advertised on the menu. i did like how they made the maki rolls with real japanese rice. we paid about $ 71 for two adults and a 4 year old, tips not included. the decor is pretty awful. the chairs were very ugly. it was very dark inside. we sat near the windows so that helped a bit in terms of lighting. i will never come here again.</li><li>Let 's start with the appetizers,- Gyoza dumplings, shrimp tempura is pretty good nothing special.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
