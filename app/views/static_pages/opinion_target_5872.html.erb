<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 5872' %><h2>deep fried banana with honey<br />occurrence: 1</h2><div><ol><li>The curry itself is amazing and not too spicy and the beef is tender on the inside and has a light crispy outside. i ca n't get myself to try any of the other mains! for apps i 've tried their mango salad ( note that there 's coriander in it, which I hate and mint leaves which I also do n't like), beef satay ( not bad), and their fried calamari ( I would get this again and loved the honey chili dipping sauce it came with). desserts I 've tried their mango sticky rice ( the mango was not sweet and really hard) and their deep fried banana with honey ( just standard). the decor here is super cool and there 's a nice patio area for the summer, I love this place!</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
