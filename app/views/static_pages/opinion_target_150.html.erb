<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 150' %><h2>ice cream<br />occurrence: 44</h2><div><ol><li>Good amount of fried chicken and the waffle came out w a mountain of ice cream, whipped cream and various sliced fruits adorning it all.</li><li>Also the ice cream was the best I 've tried at any sushi bar.</li><li>Almost forgot the dessert -- the ice cream and jello were excellent.</li><li>The ice itself is already infused with milk and sugar, so the combination with the sauces and ice cream is quite the sugar overload for me.</li><li>It was way too sweet with the ice cream and the syrups and presentation was n't very appetizing, it looked really artificial which I personally do n't like.</li><li>We also ordered the ice cream, it was n't the best, but it was satisfying.</li><li>Finally, after we ordered dessert she came out a few minutes later to inform us that they did n't have the ice cream that the pecan pie should come with.</li><li>Had the seafood pancake as well ( too much Mayo/bad filling-to-seafood ratio) and the dessert ( ice cream- red bean/green tea/black bean) is great, although an additional price.</li><li>Of course, the ice cream was good!</li><li>The bunuelos with the ice cream was my favourite although the fried ice cream was delicious and the flan was my 2nd favourite.</li><li>A glass of red bean with a scoop of ice cream is one of the selections.</li><li>However the green tea flavour for the ice cream is not strong at all.</li><li>The balance with the red bean and the ice cream was delightful!</li><li>I 've been to this place too many times to not write a review. tldr; A fantastic dessert spot for those with a sweet tooth for crepes and ice cream.</li><li>At first the two scoops of ice cream might look intimidating but you 'll soon wonder where it all went because each bite is heaven!</li><li>The only thing I 'll nitpick about this is that the crepes are cooled when they 're served to you, but that might be because they do n't want the ice cream melting everywhere.</li><li>Stuff I 've had before: Green tea with red bean crepes ( 5/5): Pretty much all their crepes are a hit but this is the other one where their ice cream is homemade.</li><li>Some ice cream is made in house which is impressive, the best I 've had is pistachio.</li><li>The ice cream was creamy and rich with sesame flavour and complemented well with small bits of crunchy granola.</li><li>Would definitely come here again, the ice cream is original and flavourful!</li><li>The ice cream on the side had brownie pieces and it was so tasty I would go back just for that.</li><li>The `` homemade'' ice cream is just right -- captures the essence of sesame and is not too sweet.</li><li>The second time I had the black sesame crepe and the ice cream was so good!</li><li>The ice cream melted fast too, almost like soft serve:/ the cheesecake ... well if you like japanese cheesecakes you 'd probably like this one.</li><li>Ice cream is great- love the strong sesame flavor and dense/hard texture, unlike some watered down versions.</li><li>5 stars for the ice cream.</li><li>Their ice cream, especially the home made flavours are so rich in flavour!</li><li>The Crepe was light and fluffy and the ice cream complimented the Crepe very well.</li><li>The ice cream is not really anything special to be honest- it is the crepe that makes it great!</li><li>They both came at a decent time, and the ice cream was still nice and firm and was not melting quickly.</li><li>The ice cream was delicious.</li><li>I definitely wo n't be back because only the ice cream was good.</li><li>The ice cream on the other hand only had coloring ... there was 0 flavour to it.</li><li>The green tea crepe was mediocre, good crepe, good ice cream, red bean on par.</li><li>I mean it was good, just not excellent. it also came with a side salad that was dressed simply with oil and vinegar, a really nice touch. then we got the black sesame crepe for dessert, and let me just say, the ice cream is KILLER. you can taste the homemadeness of it. the whole thing was sprinkled with roasted peanuts and toasted oats ( kinda like granola) that added crunch. it was fairly big, pretty damn good, and the presentation was frickin sexy. i 'll definitely be back, but maybe next time I 'll only go the dessert route.</li><li>What I find about DQ 's ice cream is that it feels and tastes, man made.</li><li>I still find it the most strangest thing for Dairy Queen to just have ice cream without the food too!</li><li>The ice cream came out, but once again NO BANANAS.</li><li>My vegetarian box had pretty much the same thing with the plain rice, steamed veggies, vegetable tempura, 3 mini pieces of cucumber roll and deep fried tofu ( forgot the actual name of whats its called) Dessert, since the box came with free ice cream, our choices were vanilla, mint chocolate and mango.</li><li>The cherries were n't even really caramelized and by the time the ice cream came to us it was a melting heap of mess.</li><li>Red bean topping for the ice cream is perfect.</li><li>The buffet has 3 rows including your typical Chinese buffet stuff ( dim sum, general tao chicken, etc.), a cold bar ( including smoked salmon, seaweed salad, shrimp) and desserts ( ice cream, flan, profiteroles, etc.).</li><li>Shaved ice, flavored syrups, evaporated milk, tapioca and taro, red beans, jelly, ice cream ... oh yes.</li><li>Ladle some of that on your ice cream and it forms a nice hard shell.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
