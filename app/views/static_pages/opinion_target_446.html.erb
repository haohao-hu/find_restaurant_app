<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 446' %><h2>Yeung Chow fried rice<br />occurrence: 9</h2><div><ol><li>Their fried rice is really good and I especially enjoy the Yeung Chow fried rice that comes with a variety of meats and vegetables.</li><li>The food is good, but not worth the teeny portion size they give you. ... while i 've always known this place existed, it 's hard for me to remember that it 's there to try it out. located in a plaza on don mills but you ca n't really see the storefront and if you 're not looking for it you 'll drive by it completely. finally we got dinner takeout as we were searching on yelp. we ordered: live whole lobster with efu noodles- excellent. yeung chow fried rice- good, but the peas were slightly undercooked. sweet cruller rice noodle rolls, good. stir fried beef with vegetables, good. deep fried squid tentacles, good. fried turnip patties Singapore style, mediocre. sweet and sour pork, excellent. the food was great, the prices are definitely cheaper than congee queen. all of that for $ 70, and they deliver for orders over $ 25- which i did n't know until we picked up the food. love delivery, especially for the winter- will definitely return!</li><li>Yeung chow fried rice, spicy salt and pepper squid, beef and dough fritter rice noodle roll and general tao chicken was what we ordered.</li><li>The yeung chow fried rice is great, as are the taro dumplings ( eat-in only as they wo n't keep their light gelatinous feel if you get them to go).</li><li>Also, their Singaporean Vermacelli, their Yeung Chow Fried Rice, their beef Ho Phun .... well, any of their noodles and fried rice are awesome. oh, but do n't try their Thai dishes ..... it 's not their forte.</li><li>A few staples that I always order: Cantonese Chow Mein, Yeung Chow Fried Rice and any of their soups.</li><li>We ordered several dishes: Scrambled egg &amp; shrimp, wonton lo mein, yeung chow fried rice, peking style pork &amp; crispy chicken.</li><li>My personal favourite: their Yeung Chow fried rice.</li><li>Some good bets: yeung chow fried rice, house seafood and mixed vegetable fried rice, and seafood super bowl congee.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
