crab, abalone -- I would have expected the chef to choose ingredients that are finer or of higher quality or just special in some way to substitute.</li><li>The Lobster and Shrimp Coddled Eggs was a bowl of buttery heaven which was made richer as you spooned into the egg yolks which intertwined in between chunks of lobster and shrimp.</li><li>The Lobster and Shrimp Coddled Eggs was a bowl of

lobster.</li><li>The lobster was amazing as well.</li><li>There was a good enough helping of lobster in the risotto though.</li><li>Sirloin with Tiger Shrimps, and from the Chef 's Specials: a linguini with half a lobster and shrimps, and an herb-crusted sea bass.</li><li>The sauce was rich but I would have appreciated more chunks of lobster rather than shreds.</li><li>An actual medium size

enough to fill us up.</li><li>Ordered: Coconut Shrimps* 5 pieces of coconut shrimps for $ 9.75* Shrimps were butterflied and deep fried with actual coconut bits in the batter* When it arrived, it was

lobster when they are fresh and I did enjoy the home cooked style the restaurant offered.</li><li>This pretty much threw everyone 's appetite for lobster trap so we decided to leave.</li><li>The lobster was gross, old, chewy, over cooked and certainly not fresh.</li><li>200.00 for four dinners, no one finished their lobster it was so bad.</li><li>My friend and I ordered: The muscles appetizer One lobster combo One lobster 2 glasses of white wine.</li><li>I ended up with a lobster bisque -- which was too creamy and very skimpy on the lobster.</li><li>The lobster was tasty.</li><li>Their lobster is not tasty and their portion sizes are small.</li><li>Stay away from this restaurant you have been warned. it 'll be the first time and most likely the last time i 'll go there. i had high expectations of a place that has lobster in their name coupled with the fact that they are in one of the more higher end areas of the city. maybe that 's the downfall. from the outside, it looks like a place that you 'd find in a old strip mall, and the interior 's more of the same. when i saw that the food and wine menu were both laminated, i started to get an idea as to what i was getting myself into both pricewise and food quality. our server was not the most attentive to our needs even though we were a group of 12, and was noticibly pushing certain items on the menu. there were also a couple of kids with us and she was n't the most friendliest person with them, seemingly just focused on doin what she needed to do to make her coin and turning the table over. not that i find it wrong but it 's not something i 'd expect from a place that you 're paying up to $ 94 for a four pound lobster. me and my friend ordered garlic shrimps to start. they were of a decent size and flavour but were lacked presentation and quantity for what we paid. i 'm not really concerned with presentation that much on the regular but the plate they served it on made it look like we were n't getting a lot or we were missing something. we both ordered a 1lb lobster with baked potato and soup. we were informed that the french fries were not available which again i would n't expect from a place where you are paying so much for your meal. my soup was a new england clam chowder that was nothing special at all. the soup nutsy or even the marche had better. the baked potato was plain with just a small dollop of sour cream to consume it with. the final item to arrive was the lobster. i ordered for it to be broiled which it did but the ' stuff' ( cause i do n't really know what the heck they decided to put on it) just made it a very messy proposition to eat. it did n't really do much to enhance the enjoyment of the lobster, and it made me wonder was it really worth the coin i just dropped for this. the whole meal just tasted only just average. the whole experience was topped off when our bill came and our waitress almost made it a point to point out that the gratuity was not included in our bill. if you really want lobster, i would just say to go to red lobster and do it there. you 'd probably pay just the same but the service would definitely be better and so would the flavours !!</li><li>Stay away from this restaurant you have been warned. it 'll be the first time and most likely the last time i 'll go there. i had high expectations of a place that has lobster in their name

dinner market price witch was $ 86 and a lobster tail $ while we were at the table a waitress was showing a almost four lb lobster to a child I must admit looked delicious.</li><li>But c 'mon what can you do with a lobster ?</li><li>And actual chunks of lobster.</li><li>I am not a fiend of lobster like some but I do eat it.</li><li>I 've tried my bf 's meal and the lobster is done to perfection.</li><li>Would n't that make the lobster almost 30 years old ?</li><li>I always get 1.5 lbs lobster along with lobster bisque and salad.</li><li>Then the lobster comes, it tastes very good.</li><li>Not anything can beat a fresh lobster.</li><li>The bottom line is the lobster is still very good but the lobster bisque is out and the price has been increased.</li><li>2) Lobster meal ( 1 lb): The lobster was split in half and my friend and I each got a half.</li><li>There was freshness preserved but I 've definitely had better lobster in the past.</li><li>My boyfriend is a bit of a seafood connoisseur, so after eating crab and lobster a dozen of times at Chinese restaurants, Red Lobster and at home, we decided to go for something different.</li><li>Now, if you 're interested in getting a real seafood experience, i.e. digging into the seafood and not just eating the claw/tail of the lobster, then go here!</li><li>If you 're not open minded enough to try eating the body of the lobster or would like to stick to seafood that does n't really look like seafood, then go to Red Lobster.</li><li>Then we both shared a huge lobster, I believe it was 6-7lbs that we hand picked from their aquarium.</li><li>We chose the steamed method of cooking ( there was steamed or deep-fried) because we felt that it would bring out the taste of the lobster best, while keeping it nice and juicy ( which it was).</li><li>They steamed the lobster and split it right down the middle!</li><li>We got the 2 pound lobster each with the upgrade combo with soup and drink.</li><li>We usually get a lobster ( maybe 1.5 lbs) broiled, salad, fries or roast potato, drink, garlic bread and awesome lobster bisque.</li><li>The best place for steamed lobster.</li><li>I always order the 1lb and a quarter lobster.</li><li>The lobster is very fresh and price is reasonable ( around $ 35- $ 40 if you do n't order drinks or anything else).</li><li>I have had lobster at Red Lobster and it is n't comparable.</li><li>I have also had lobster in Maine and cooked the Lobster fresh from T &amp; T supermarket and by comparison, this place is very good.</li><li>Lobster YUM!</li><li>We have a party of 5, so we ordered a 2 1/2 lobster for 2 ppl and 4lb lobster for 4ppl.</li><li>We have a party of 5, so we ordered a 2 1/2 lobster for 2 ppl and 4lb lobster for 4ppl.</li><li>Both lobster is huge!</li><li>The boiled version they mix the breadcrumb with herbs and butter and baked it wit the lobster.</li><li>The lobster is certainly fresh and not over cooked.</li><li>The lobster is very good, but small for $ 40.00.</li><li>The food was not presented nicely, and while the lobster seemed fresh, the taste was n't rich enough for the 1 1/2 broiled lobster ( $ 49).</li><li>It took them about 40 minutes to get our main entree and we did n't get our necessary condiments ( butter for lobster and other seafood) until we were halfway done.</li><li>Adding to what is becoming a bad dinner night, sauces for seafood and baked potato came in disposable ketchup cups that you see at McDonald 's; they said they ran out of those ' aprons' to cover your shirt when eating lobster; and they also happened to run out of lobster cutters as well.</li><li>When the waitress ( who seemed like the owner) took our orders of 4 appetizers and a 1 1/4 lobster, she was all like `` you 're in a group of 4, you need to order at least 2 entrees''.</li><li>My first experience with lobster was circa Hanukkah 1993.</li><li>The irony of my family going out for un-kosher lobster on a Jewish holiday is certainly not lost on me.</li><li>The main event is always good, obviously certain times of year are going to yield fresher results but I 've never had an issue with less than delicious lobster.</li><li>Soup was great- Lobster was splendid ( no sure if that was 2 1/2 pounds).</li><li>Lobster: The most common dish ordered here is, obviously, a whole lobster.</li><li>Had lots of chunks of lobster, so much flavor, and so, so creamy, probably made with a bazillion calories of real butter and cream.</li><li>The chunks of lobster got replaced by bits of undissolved cornstarch.</li><li>There were these flame heated glass bowls of butter for you to dip your lobster in.</li><li>She gave us extra lobster, extra lobster bisque, extra salads, extra dessert at the end.</li><li>My girlfriend loved the lobster.</li><li>Over all: 4/10 I suppose if you want a lobster and nothing else and do n't mind sitting in a depressing dining room this could be a winner for you. but I am serious, order your lobster and tell them they can just keep the sides.</li><li>Over all: 4/10 I suppose if you want a lobster and nothing else and do n't mind sitting in a depressing dining room this could be a winner for you. but I am serious, order your lobster and tell them they can just keep the sides.</li><li>The lobster is beautifully cooked- scrumptious, moist.</li><li>However, if you know this is what to expect, the lobster is worth these downers.</li><li>THE BOTTOM LINE: know you 're not going to a white tablecloth place, but be rest assured the lobster is delicious.</li><li>Best lobster I 've ever had.</li><li>That said, each of the times I 've gone, they 've delivered a perfectly cooked lobster to my table.</li><li>We order the lobster which was not spicy at all and very oily.</li><li>Lots of variety, always get lobster and chicken and duck congee which are both delicious.</li><li>Well, the lobster was succulent and perfectly poached in the congee.</li><li>The bowl is huge and could feed a lot of people for that 21.95,, but we ate up the lobster and about half the congee and called it done.</li><li>A little pricey, but this was a whole, LARGE lobster, and they had it cracked and separated making it so easy to get the meat out and enjoy.</li><li>Food: The selection is pretty standard, a lot of fish balls, vegetables, lamb, beef slices and a seafood option that includes 1/2 lobster.</li><li>We had a platter of tofu, cold pig ears, pork belly, veggies, Peking duck two ways ( wraps and lettuce), fried rice, and lobster.</li><li>We also ordered the lobster, house special fried rice and broccoli.</li><li>I get that duck and lobster can be pricey but for the overall quality of the food it felt like a total rip-off.</li><li>The crab and the lobster were fried in the same tasteless junk probably used to grease door hinges.</li><li>I love lobster and was worried about it tasting bad being uncooked, but i was quite impressed.</li><li>We are surprised to have lobster added to the Tepanyaki dinner.</li><li>We had booked the typical ten course meal of assorted BBQ meats, fried chicken, Peking duck, lettuce wrap with minced duck, seafood egg drop soup, lobster, fried fish, veggies, fried rice, fried noodles, and dessert.</li><li>Lobster, crab and shrimp.</li><li>One of the suited manager put our Lobster down then picked it back up to turn around, then turns back to us and puts it down.</li><li>Lobster Sashimi was A-OK but the portion is not worth the value.</li><li>When we tried to place our order, they told us we have to order an even number of specials cuz they ca n't give us just half of a lobster.</li><li>$ 19.95 for a half lobster, appetizers and a main with salad, soup etc.</li><li>It seems that the menu is geared towards impressing the Chinese palette for fresh seafood ( i.e. lobster, crab), which- as a herbivore- I ca n't say too much about.</li><li>My wife and son also enjoyed a lobster.</li><li>The lobster was good though and there was plenty of it in the order!</li><li>The ginger flavor of the lobster meshed very well with the noodle, which sort of helped save the disappointing noodles.</li><li>The lobster was cooked just right.</li><li>The seafood are fairly fresh but Im not a fan of the drenched sauce and the lobster was covered with starchy and chewy greasy tempura bits which I always hate.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
