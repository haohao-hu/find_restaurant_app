<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 121' %><h2>cakes<br />occurrence: 56</h2><div><ol><li>But in our next visit, we would definitely have some of their crème brule and cakes.</li><li>-- Overall -- Originally we wanted to try their crepes and other cakes.</li><li>A pair of shrimp-and-crab cakes should also be shared, but between it 's crispy exterior and sweet melting seafood, greed may indeed be good.</li><li>Their fresh pastries and cakes are baked daily.</li><li>Even with the double cheese and extra cakes, we felt like it was STILL too small a portion for the price.</li><li>The fries are yummy and next door there is a bakery which had very good Cakes and Pastries.</li><li>I 've gotten waffles, crepes ( of course heh) the cakes, the lattes and the iced drinks as well.</li><li>It 's a very clean and well organized shop that sells both hot and cold drinks ( the non bubble tea variety) along with their selection of sweet/savory crepes/waffles and cakes.</li><li>The cakes could definitely be improved in terms of flavour, but they look incredibly scrumptious so the appearance threw me off.</li><li>They might want to think about sourcing some macarons or specialty churros to add a bit more variety to individual cakes and crepes.</li><li>I been to Pastel before and mostly I come here for the cakes ( which is from Rahier) I came here to mini celebrate my friend 's birthday and she ordered a cheese cake.</li><li>Anyways got the menu again and order a crepe since by then all the cakes were gone.</li><li>We were too full from lunch and did n't have room to try their crepes or cakes, so ca n't comment on those.</li><li>I 'd go back again to see how the rest of their cakes were ( I was in a happy-full state and forgot to order a few to go), but I do hope this place sticks around for a while.</li><li>The crêpes and cakes are the perfect texture and sweetness ( Try the shortcake or brownie crêpe, it 's my favourite).</li><li>We also ordered the cakes, they are from Rahier Patisserie.</li><li>However, the cakes I had yesterday ( coffee flavoured and crème brûlée) was awful.</li><li>Hope to return one day to have that option and also try the yummy cakes and other crepes and waffles.</li><li>Nice and clean, though the decor is confusing ( christmas garlands with nutcrackers and fake summer flowers ?) anyway, the service is great, the girl is always standing waiting to serve you, though she did n't understand my question when i asked what type of cakes they have.</li><li>I spent the time admiring the modern decor ( still with Christmas decorations haha) and looked at the different cakes available ( some from Cheesecake factory!) behind their glass display.</li><li>Excellent presentation of crepes, waffles, and cakes.</li><li>Their cakes are awesome!</li><li>Have never tried their crapes, though, nor have I dined in there ( always grab their cakes to go), but the staff is always friendly and welcoming.</li><li>The cakes are from Rahier- it will save you a trip but you can probably buy it elsewhere if you are craving cake.</li><li>They also has savoury crepes, waffle options, cakes, and parfaits.</li><li>The last thing is that neither the `` photo book'' nor the menu showed all the variety of cakes offered.</li><li>Amazing cakes from la rocha.</li><li>The cakes are too sweet and too big.</li><li>Crepes and waffles and cakes, OH MY!</li><li>On top of their well known crepes and waffles, they always have amazing cakes and cookies to choose from.</li><li>Most of the cakes are really good, frozen yogurt is really good.</li><li>Fantastic bread, pastries and cakes too.</li><li>We go and look at their cakes, my guest asks what kind of cake a certain one was and the guy just looks at it and swats his hand and a good 30- 40 fruit flies just disperse into the air .. and that leaves us noticing that the cake now looks COMPLETELY different haha so we decide to have some fresh made crepes, ca n't go wrong with that right ?</li><li>Only their cakes were decent.</li><li>I have been here quite a few times, what I love the most is the selection of cakes!</li><li>The Desserts: All of their desserts are phenomenal from their crepes, to their waffles, cakes and ice-creams.</li><li>They have everything under the sun on their menu from pizza, pastries, cakes, etc.</li><li>Their cakes are delicious as well.</li><li>My friend and I went for dessert, and was sad to see that there was only a small little display of cakes at the counter, whereas the number of cakes in the Waterloo location would take about 3 minutes for the servers to list them all to you ( and they memorized all the cakes every day).</li><li>I am interested in trying their dinner menu and while I could n't do it at the time, because I was already full from brunch, their daily deals seemed promising- Sundays offering 2 for 1 cake slices and the cakes looked delicious.</li><li>It 's the best meringue cake in the city probably. and the rest of their cakes are really good as well!</li><li>I do like that their cakes are n't overly sweet though.</li><li>They have the best cakes ever.</li><li>They always have fresh cakes and they also not as sweet as other places.</li><li>Seemed to be a very popular place for their cakes, especial popular amongst the older Asian ladies who tend to favor cakes with less sugar.</li><li>The whole time we were there people were in and out getting cakes.</li><li>But beyond that, you can pick up better meringue, cakes, and pastries in other cafes and high end grocery stores.</li><li>Their cakes are ok, but if I 'm eating a cake with lots of calories, it might as well be sweet.</li><li>There was quite a wide collection of different assortments of cakes, though I was told their cheesecakes were n't the best.</li><li>My favourite was mango, this was a super crumbly cake and goes so well with coffee: 3 Would definitely go back to try another one of their pretty cakes!</li><li>Price was $ 20-40 for entire cakes ( not sure about how much per slice, though .. but since it 's an Asian place, you do probably get your money 's worth).</li><li>The cakes are reasonably priced and not too sweet like most Asian bakeries.</li><li>People who usually buy cakes are in a joyous mood trying to celebrate a joyous occasion.</li><li>Despite the bad service the cakes here are good.</li><li>My family has been going to Maxim 's for at least 15 years for their cakes.</li><li>The other cakes are ok.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
