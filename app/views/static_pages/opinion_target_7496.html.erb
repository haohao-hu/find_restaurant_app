<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 7496' %><h2>eggs benedict with smoked salmon<br />occurrence: 1</h2><div><ol><li>Ordered over-medium once and received over easy, which was unappetising and went uneaten ... love this mom and pops place! the staff is quite friendly and the owner always greets us personally whenever he 's around. i have personally only ever ordered from their all day breakfast menu so i ca n't speak for their lunch and dinner but it is the best breakfast at the most decent price. while i have ordered many breakfast dishes, my favorite go-to is the eggs benedict with smoked salmon and asparagus. i must have had this dish once a week for the past year and it 's been cooked to perfection every time. the sauce is not too heavy, not too light. the eggs are always made the way you like it- i make sure i get them to soft poach them. home fries are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. weekend mornings and brunch time get pretty busy but it is always worth the wait:) Solid breakfast choice if you 're in that area.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
