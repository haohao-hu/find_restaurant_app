<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 4' %><h2>menu<br />occurrence: 814</h2><div><ol><li>I have n't tried many other things on the menu because I tend to stick to what I like ( selective eater over here) but I have tried their egg drop soup in the past which was very good as well as the roast beef sandwich.</li><li>I 've been told the other things on the menu are pretty good too, but I 've only ever tried the various salads.</li><li>My only complaint is that they crossed off chicken feet on the menu.</li><li>Mt girlfriends family has made a tradition of going here every year for dinner on New Years Day ( why we keep going when one of the kids got their meal AFTER everyone else ate last year) Anyways, I tried a few things on the menu until I came across the souvlaki ( the meat, veg and rice was nothing special, but wow did I ever fall in love with the dressing on the Greek salad).</li><li>The server gets 4 stars for being patient and upbeat but did n't know what anything on the menu was.</li><li>As I pursued the menu I was told there is no chef, but he should be there in ten minutes.</li><li>Food here is pretty good, but the best thing on the menu is the Spicy Salmon Maki- you can definitely taste the spice!</li><li>The menu has Chinese/Korean and with English description of what each dishes are.</li><li>Since we are have 3 of us and we are all sharing, we decide to order varieities of dishes to try out the menu.</li><li>They, errr, did n't really look like the ones on the menu.</li><li>The menu is n't all that great, the service was unfriendly and the bacon cheeseburger I had was `` just okay''.</li><li>It deserves 5 stars for several reasons: 1) The decor is very Chinese, and youthful, and hip, I like what they did for Chinese new year 2012 2) The menu has been redesigned.</li><li>Have not try any cooked food on the menu.</li><li>The menu is n't too bad but I ca n't bring myself to buy another fruit dessert because they are something easy to prepare and costs quite a bit at 31 kitchen.</li><li>The only thing missing from their menu is the egg or milk pudding ( dun daan) I 'm not sure why they do n't make it.</li><li>I was warned that there would be nothing for me to eat here besides the salad bar, but I figured that was an exaggeration- surely there must be some appetizer, composed salad, or pasta that was n't full of meat on the regular menu.</li><li>I wanted Pizzaiolo since they carry vegan pizzas and generally, places that have vegan pizzas on the menu will taste better than ones that let cheese do the heavy lifting.</li><li>Their menu is simple but still caters to a wide variety of selections which is a good thing.</li><li>The rest of the sandwiches on the menu are `` supreme'' and around $ 10.</li><li>The menu really only consists of like 15 items, but each one is interesting in its own way.</li><li>The menu consists of Chinese and Thai dishes.</li><li>Note that this review is based on ordering the chef 's choice or tasting menu, which had to be booked in advanced.</li><li>Jollytops, kindly have these removed from your menu and work on improving quality and serve these ' maruyas' fresh and never more than a day old.</li><li>Since we were in a rush we browsed the menu.</li><li>The one I ca n't see always shows the menu.</li><li>This is one crazy Flea Market that basically has everything from antiques, persian rugs, perfume, clothes, car parts, electronics and knock off stuff Come hungry because the food court at the back offers the most diverse menu Caribbean, latin american, chinese, and a girl that makes awesome cupcakes.</li><li>The menu is pretty standard for what it is.</li><li>We ordered have had almost all they had on their menu, my favorite nontheless is their chicken and lamb shish kebob.</li><li>They constantly run out of Laffas ( A larger form of Pita bread) and their descriptions of what is on the menu is not entirely accurate of what they offer.</li><li>Once you 're over the tackiness of the place you take a look at the menu, only to realize that their bento boxes are almost $ 30 !!!</li><li>The menu was ridiculously expensive- $ 15.50 for the roll we ordered ( sorry, forgot the name, but it sucked!)- we had to pay $ 1 extra for spicy mayo, which they gave quite a bit in a small dish.</li><li>Its menu not only had all the same items as DD but it also had lasagna, soup combo!</li><li>Do n't expect a large menu or a fish of the day.</li><li>The menu was outrageously expensive for the food that 's offered.</li><li>The staff is extremely patient and willing to suggest different items on the menu.</li><li>The menu was all in Farsi.</li><li>Now on to my review**** Spicy Chicken House is a smaller restaurant with an inexpensive menu.</li><li>Food portions were TINY and prices are high ... ( i speak of the ala carte menu not AYCE) came in on a near empty Wednesday night ... promptly seated .. then that was it .. they litterally just forgot about us .. no tea no menu .. they just went to the back and dissapeared for a good 13 minutes or so .. cant even wave anyone down. when we finally got the menu, anything remotely resembling a deal cannot be used with the groupon ... ( ALL bento boxes) so i ordered a chirashi.</li><li>We dined a la carte, the Mizuki Roll looks awesome on the menu, with a thick slice of salmon torched .. what was served tho was a wafer thin slice of salmon that was barely there.</li><li>Good selection on menu.</li><li>But then upon studying the menu, you could not order the bento boxes on the last page of the menu either.</li><li>All you can eat prices: Mon- Thurs Adults $ 24 Fri, Sun &amp; Holidays $ 26 ( I do n't know where Saturday falls into because the menu is clearly missing that) Certain Chinese newspapers have cut-out coupons for this place.</li><li>The `` Free Dinner'' did not have an asterisk beside it on their menu but their 15% off did.</li><li>The menu is quite large, even for the lunch menu, which is definitely a plus.</li><li>The food at this place is very good everything on the menu is worth trying and prices are fair as well, how ever the service sucks!</li><li>Then last year they changed their menu, ingredients, and prices.</li><li>I do n't care if I 've been to a million sushi restaurants or the same sushi restaurant a million times, a sushi restaurant needs to have photographs on the menu!</li><li>The menu was large with tons of combos, platters and specialty rolls.</li><li>The menu is HUGE.</li><li>The menu of this place is very similar to Tomo with a few tweaks here and there.</li><li>The menu is extensive and a bit confusingly organized.</li><li>We also ordered three rolls, Spicy Killer ( i think ?) which Mr. H and I assumed was shrimp tempura on the inside but the entire roll was deep fried ( makes me think the menu is very clear).</li><li>I was really excited by the many options on the menu, and when my order arrived I was blown away!</li><li>Prices were fair and I will definitely return to this restaurant as there were so many great sounding items on the menu ( many unique combinations).</li><li>The menu there is exploding with hundreds of interesting options.</li><li>I would recommend anything on the menu.</li><li>They offer many a la carte items, and the menu is well laid out and the items are explained properly.</li><li>First, the menu is extensive!</li><li>They have a very limited menu- no food and no iced coffee ( only hot coffee and iced caps).</li><li>It 's my `` go to'' place for comfort food, yet I ca n't get myself to try anything else on the menu as a main ( except for the appetizers, of course).</li><li>The staff seem to enjoy chatting about the items on the menu.</li><li>I suspect all the food on the menu is good from the moans of pleasure from tables around us, along with the lineup of customers arriving without reservations, but there are gems throughout the menu that will become your favorites.</li><li>They have quite an extensive menu but what impresses me most is that most of their pasta dishes are around $ 11-13.</li><li>***** UPDATE***** The menu has changed since this review.</li><li>I 've had several different items on the menu and so far none have been anything less than great.</li><li>There was basically nothing on the menu aside from pasta.</li><li>The service is good and the menu is not too expensive.</li><li>I can get past that because they had loads of other good stuff on the menu.</li><li>Atmosphere was great, service superb, and the menu was extensive and very reasonable.</li><li>The menu does n't have an extensive selection of meals as other Viet restaurants but they do have the basics of spring rolls, pho ( beef and chicken), pho beef stew, rice and noodles.</li><li>They also have a great drink menu with bubble tea ( $ 4)!</li><li>The menu- tiny print, poorly designed, unclear wording, not enough images- shows 2 or 3 combos, none of which would be practical for a single person grabbing a bite so they can muster up the energy to deal with the TTC.</li><li>The menu is n't extensive but the gluten-free options make this a viable choice if you 're looking for Celiac-friendly Italian dining.</li><li>The best meal on the menu, Veal Marsala, is now gone.</li><li>The menu has n't changed much over the years, but no real need to.</li><li>The last part of their menu are Thai food.</li><li>The picture of this fried rice on their overhead menu was very yellow.</li><li>The regular menu ( lunch/dinner) is quite extensive so I was a bit disappointed when the brunch menu was so tiny.</li><li>Anything you want- they will make whether its on the menu or not!</li><li>So I had an amazing omlette ( came with a gigantic plate of home fries and toast) but not one of the ones on the menu.</li><li>If I 'm not sure what to eat around my area this place is the place to go since their menu is so vast.</li><li>The menu is varied and surprisingly broad.</li><li>They have a menu for all price range so weather on a budget or not you can get a filling meal.</li><li>It had a surprisingly large menu and the prices were n't too pricey, but I would n't consider it as cheap either.</li><li>Everything on the menu is Amazing.</li><li>I forgot what my dad ordered but he really liked it ( I think it 's G1 on the menu ..) he asked for it to be mild and that 's what he got.</li><li>First off, looking at their menu, they had a variety of Korean ginseng chicken soup like green tea ( very interesting).</li><li>Their menu is also smaller than most.</li><li>The menu is easy to navigate.</li><li>Her English was not great but made a sincere effort to explain the menu and food.</li><li>The menu is a bit limited though.</li><li>Pros: Ginseng Chicken soup that ca n't be found at most Korean restaurants Very well done side dishes Cons: Pricey for a Korean restaurant Not much variety in menu No Gamjatang ??</li><li>After having a seat and looking at the menu, you find there 's really not much variety.</li><li>The menu is small.</li><li>Bit bummed they did n't have gamjatang on the menu but it was nice to try something new.:) As for the interior of the place, it is clean, crisp and classy.</li><li>They had things that looked really good on the menu.</li><li>Note that the menu is huge and can feel overwhelming.</li><li>However, I 'm positive that nothing on the menu would disappoint!</li><li>I found this restaurant on yelp with rave reviews, so my friend ( who loves szechuan food) and I try it out. upon walking in, we are the only chinese customers in the restaurant. the menu is mainly an english one with our favourite szechuan dishes missing ( ex.</li><li>She still did not acknowledge me until I stood up and asked her if i could have the menu for delivery.</li><li>I had the hunan beef ( with a chili sign on the menu to indicate it was spicy).</li><li>She noted while looking at the menu `` I 'm looking for something on this menu I ca n't cook.'' ( Hmmm.</li><li>She noted while looking at the menu `` I 'm looking for something on this menu I ca n't cook.'' ( Hmmm.</li><li>The menu promises everything from Italian to Israeli, with soups and sandwiches thrown into the mix.</li><li>I will have to come back here and try everything else on the menu!</li><li>The menu is huge and awesome.</li><li>It is well worth the long wait which just shows how popular it is and the menu is exquisite.</li><li>One of the 2 women from the Kitchen comes out after awhile to give me a Menu.</li><li>I would definitely come back and try other items on the menu.</li><li>The menu said the carne asada just came with rice and salad but I was pleasantly surprised to find beans, tortilla and plantains with the meal.</li><li>The menu offers the staples: platano, arroz, beans, yuca, pescado frito, pupusas, sopas, carne asada, chicharron, etc.</li><li>The menu almost entirely consists of some sort of fruit.</li><li>I have been here several times and there is defiantly a nice wide variety of items on the menu.</li><li>We both highly recommend the soups.:) The next great feature is the menu is equipped with little GF logos throughout to make it easier for gluten intolerant people to select an entree.</li><li>Not a bright idea to have Chinese, Thai &amp; Japanese food offered on 1 menu.</li><li>Anyway, the AYCE menu is amazing because, surprisingly, they have GOOD sushi with very little rice and a lot of stuff.</li><li>There are not many Asian-style restaurants that include gluten-free options, but Spring Rolls does ( although not specified on the menu, the waitstaff are familiar with ingredients).</li><li>I did not walk into this place with high expectations since it is not known for their gourmet flavours and unique menu.</li><li>However, in having a simple and classic breakfast/brunch menu, orders should be flying out of the kitchen in perfect sequence and properly cooked.</li><li>I love egg benedicts so I ordered a vegetarian option that was not on the menu ( the menu in general is not super veg friendly) for some reason they give you an option of having the eggs hard, medium or soft which I never experienced before in any of the brunch places. bennies just always come soft- otherwise they 're not bennies but hard boiled eggs on top of an english muffin, the portion included only side of fries and two bennies with spinach. no slices of orange, no toast included. total of $ 9 the spinach somehow had very grassy taste. hollandaise sauce was too salty and flavorless ... the whole food tasting experience was just blah. on the other end the service was very nice and even though they confused my friend 's order the replacement came in in matter of seconds and she was charged less. but I 'm not going back for eggs ... maybe will check pancakes or waffles.</li><li>I love egg benedicts so I ordered a vegetarian

far!</li><li>Japanese and Korean BBQ with a massive menu.</li><li>Would definitely return to try some of the other items in their extensive menu.</li><li>Kum Kang San is nearly hidden behind the trees on Dufferin St. However, the interior is quite large and the menu is HUGE!</li><li>Unfortunately they do n't have a website yet, but take my word for it- the menu is awesome!</li><li>The weak part of the menu is everything else.</li><li>As well their menu does have a couple of more items.</li><li>The menu is a bit short and features some Malaysian curries and Hainan chicken as well as traditional Vietnamese dishes.</li><li>Menu is reasonable and priced similarly to other pho houses.</li><li>We then decided to order several items to split and she scoffed as if we were being cheap for wanting to try more items on the menu.</li><li>Vietnamese Delight has a few ' lunch' specials ( available 11am- 5pm!) for $ 6.99 that include either soup or a spring roll but I opted to order from the main ' placemat' menu and had the Malaysian Curry Chicken with rice for $ 6.99.</li><li>From looking at the menu, I thought the chicken is boneless but no I was wrong.</li><li>What I also like about this place is how current the menu is- they offer many dishes and noodles on the menu that is currently popular in Sichuan, and you wo n't find it anywhere else in Toronto.</li><li>What I also like about this place is how current the menu is- they offer many dishes and noodles on the menu that is currently popular in Sichuan, and you wo n't find it anywhere else in Toronto.</li><li>Their menu is relatively large and even has pictures which I found very helpful and tempting.</li><li>The mango was also pretty good, however the strawberry was better balance in the desert. and the waffle had a good presentation value. the only thing about the waffle is that its definitely not what they show you on the menu, on the menu they advertise the oreo waffle as a waffle infused with oreo and chocolate flavour, with vanilla ice cream on it.</li><li>The menu has a fair amount of selections including coffees, teas, combos with desserts and of course shaved ice.</li><li>I 'm not a student anymore so if they ca n't serve good food/drinks then I 'll look somewhere else. coming out of kbbq, I was looking for something sweet to end the night. headed down south on Yonge st and made a pit stop here at this cafe. did n't really get a chance to read any reviews on this place but decided to make my way up to the second floor to give this a try. pictures in the menu looked pretty good but it was actually very deceiving. let 's start with the hot drinks.</li><li>If Starbucks/Timmies had this on their menu, I 'd order it every day in the winter.</li><li>I 've tried a number of items on the menu and have been happy with all of them ( steak sandwich, souvlaki, ribs, wings, KILLER greek salad) I promise to take pictures next time ...</li><li>If you are nearby, feeling hungry and cold, do n't hesitate, come in and order up a bowl of pho without even looking at the menu, you will be happy very quickly.</li><li>My plate was also a recommended top ordered item on the menu.</li><li>Some items are extremely inexpensive for what you get, while others seem a tad high ... examine the menu and be aware.</li><li>They also usually have specials for that day for pasta and pizza that is n't on the menu.</li><li>Overall, it was a good experience and we 'll be back to try a few other items on the menu.</li><li>Typically, the pizzas are the better option on the menu.</li><li>Prices have gone up and the portions have in fact decreased, even though the menu is still the same.</li><li>We 'll definitely be back and for those of you that want other options, there were many choices on the menu, Enjoy!</li><li>The menu does not match the dining experience you think you 're going to have.</li><li>I have not had everything on the menu but every time I dine at Miller I am underwhelmed.</li><li>I continue to be disappointed about the menu but the location and ambiance is great.</li><li>Other than that, the menu remains pretty much the same.</li><li>A whole section of the menu is devoted to burgers, beef and otherwise, all sided with serviceable slaw and regrettably frozen fries.</li><li>That said, a substituted blue cheese Caesar or cheddar-laced potato cake from the steak portion of the menu turns one 's attention elsewhere.</li><li>But looking up and down the menu, I just feel a bit underwhelmed by it all considering the price.</li><li>I know, it sounds extreme but the menu is to die for.</li><li>I hear the `` Comfort Foods'' section of the menu is the best- I ordered the Beef Tenderloin Cavatappi off of this once and it was amazing.</li><li>The menu is not extensive, but they are good at whatever they make, always fresh oysters and salads, wide variety of wines will not leave anyone disappointed.</li><li>Staff was attentive and friendly and seemed to make strong recommendations from the menu but not so much from the cocktail menu.</li><li>( $ 25) with Nova Scotia Lobster Tail ( $ 15) and Mashed Potatoes because it sounded very appetizing on the menu.</li><li>We encouraged our guests to choose anything they wanted on the menu.</li><li>Lots of choices on the menu.</li><li>Overall: We will 100% be coming back and I will be trying new foods from a great menu which has something for everyone.</li><li>Simple menu and reasonable prices compared to most steakhouses out here- it 's a solid 3/5.</li><li>The dessert and holiday menu were a little meh but the awesome steak made up for that.</li><li>I 'm sure the menu is decent but I did n't try it.</li><li>The menu was interesting- like high end pub fare- maybe that 's the difference between a pub and a tavern ?</li><li>Oysters on the menu always wins a star for me!</li><li>I ordered nabe/chicken noodle, really like it, the California roll is also very tasty, they got plenty of food on the menu, I 'm goona try the teriyaki next time.</li><li>Quality sashimi balanced by tasteful cooked plates, beautifully arranged plates, beautiful ambience, extensive ETOH menu, and charming chef and waitress.</li><li>They offer lunch specials until 3pm and an extensive menu.</li><li>Overall I would definitely come back and try the other items on the menu.</li><li>I always get the American breakfast on the menu.</li><li>Portions are massive, everything else on the menu is awesome ( kebob 's are unbelievable, sides are unbelieveable, my dad can eat a whole serving of rice just plain).</li><li>The menu is vague, and the sandwich toppings are very different from what I 'm used to.</li><li>I have never been to a Kelsey 's but the menu seemed limited.</li><li>The food is average, the menu is simple with burgers, chicken fingers, pasta 's and chicken.</li><li>I 've pretty much eaten almost everything on the menu.</li><li>Their menu has not changed for years, and items to choose from are limited and pricier than Jack Astors or Moxies.</li><li>Not to say that they do n't have any other food options on their menu- I 've had the salmon before.</li><li>The menu itself is pretty decent, lots of choices standard fare like burgers, steak frites, sandwiches .... prices were really good too.</li><li>The absolutely worst part is that no where on their menu was it mentioned that these items had peanuts or nuts.</li><li>It takes 5 minutes to add a sticker to your menu to be cautious and considerate.</li><li>The menu does list a few things that I had not seen at other Iranian restaurant like tongue, liver and other special sides.</li><li>I keep wanting to try something else on the menu but I ca n't not order the jerk chicken.</li><li>All your Korean standards are well represented on the menu.</li><li>The food was n't bad but when things on the menu are n't what they seem, we have a bit of a problem here.</li><li>I should note that the Chicago and Yoko special rolls did n't end up looking anything like pictures on the menu.</li><li>Fast service the food is always fresh and delicious they can make anything on the menu just the way you like it and the portions are just perfect for sharing so you can order multiple items to share.</li><li>I would definitely pay for this if it was on the menu ( shhh .... do n't tell them or they might just start doing this) and it 's probably why I come here instead of other sushi places.</li><li>They do have a very extensive menu with very many choices and you wonder how they can cook all these things so well.</li><li>So I did have a long look at the menu and I must have been taking too long ( 5 minutes) because the waitress came and took my drink order.</li><li>Our waitress barely spoke english and did n't really know the menu, the manager who came to explain was a bit under dressed like she was heading to a new years party in Phuket.</li><li>Overall I think this is the best Sushi place in York Mills because the menu offers something for everyone and everything is good quality and tasty.</li><li>Also, there was korean food on the menu too with all korean people working there but the server was very pushy in the way she acted like we asked for a couple minutes with the menu and she would push her way to get us to order when we literally had no time with the menu ..</li><li>Also, there

the menu does only come with one soup and one salad ( if I 'm not mistaken), and if they bring you two of either one ( usually the soup), it means you 're probably not going to get the other one ( usually the salad), so you might want to clarify which one you want.</li><li>They do allow you to share this menu, but the menu does only come with one soup and one salad ( if I 'm not mistaken), and

really liked their menu too.</li><li>The menu said there would be falafel, but we didnt get any.</li><li>Even though they were about to close, they were super friendly and patient with us as we studied the menu and tried to decide:) We settled on the Jerk Chicken dinner with ox-tail gravy.</li><li>Heard they are finally moving to a bigger location in the same mall- perhaps some new items on the menu too ??!</li><li>What is going through his head I will never know, but damn do they know how to make a good sammich. jerk chicken with cole slaw on cocobread. it is fuckin delicious. no lie. yeah the place is a little dark and grimy but there is no better spot. they recently got rid of their old grooved changeable letterboard menu, sad !!!!! my brother moved to asia and pines for the jerk chicken sandwiches from allwyns!</li><li>The menu is quite limited though and I was disappointed that there is not a single pasta dish.</li><li>The menu accommodates the mid-town location, surrounded by a lot of competition by including an appetizer of frites and a burger on the menu, but make no mistake someone here really knows what they are doing in the kitchen!</li><li>After a big kerfuffle between a couple of staff members, a menu was brought to us at the cashiers.</li><li>My girlfriend said, I think he said `` when you 're ready to order it would be over there'' I asked another server we 're ready to order, she said the same thing I could n't believe it. it 's a restaurant not a fast-food restaurant. we were given a menu, they brought bread but yet I had to walk to a small corner with the menu where there was one guy taking everyone 's orders. waited about 7 minutes to order.</li><li>You sit, look at a menu, then go down a corridor to order, then a waitress brings it to your table.</li><li>They have a large menu and several vegetarian options, about 4-5 entrees ( not just a veggie souvlaki folks).</li><li>So after about 10-15 minutes, she finally comes to our table with our menu.</li><li>The menu was n't impressive at all, with the few choice of meat entrees being at least $ 18.</li><li>Being a Scottish expat a was especially excited that they had both haggis and black pudding on the menu.</li><li>Having been here a few times and enjoying the staple haddock and chips I ventured out to some of the other items on the menu.</li><li>Great quality food and a nice, variable menu.</li><li>The menu consists of many favorites and they have specials littered across the wall like many a familiar restaurant.</li><li>The menu is limited; however the wings &amp; fries are excellent ( other options include chicken fingers, chicken pot pie and pepperoni pizza).</li><li>There are other items on the menu including tacos and quessadillas, but not much else.</li><li>Either way- it is worth ordering if you ever see it on the menu, especially at Tutto Pronto!</li><li>I 'm very much looking forward to going back and trying even more off of their great menu.</li><li>The menu is Chinese and Philipino at the same time.</li><li>You simply jot down the number of the item that you want on the slip and when the wait staff returns, return the menu and paper with your order and they 'll return with all of your food.</li><li>FOOD I had my same pho with rare beef, beef intestine ( they say it more eloquently on the menu).</li><li>I looked at the menu and after looking through it all I had decided on what I wanted to eat.</li><li>Order something on the Menu that is cooked by the Kitchen and sharable.</li><li>The menu said pork bone soup with potatoes.</li><li>They literally had 2 waitress doing stupid task like arranging the menu at the counter instead of cleaning up tables or seating customers.</li><li>I was pleasantly surprized that they offered grilled chicken heart skewers and sizzling flounder on the menu and gladly ordered a few rounds to indulge.</li><li>Everything else is done quite nicely, everything on the menu quite delicious.</li><li>Everything on the menu is great ... although I would be careful with the grilled fish.</li><li>Some of the things that stood out from their menu: scallop sashimi ( diced to small pieces) and steamed egg.</li><li>A lot of variety on the menu!</li><li>Only giving 3 starts because the beef teriyaki was undercooked and raw when they served it, and they forgot some items on the menu.</li><li>To sum everything up, I would definitely come back even though I will not be ordering sushi rolls, there were many items on their menu I loved other than the rolls, lets just hope I receive them hehehehe.</li><li>The food is good and there are a lot of good points and must tries to this AYCE:- scallop sashimi ( it was quite delicious and fresh)- beef tataki ( although I was n't a fan of it)- gui ling gao ( in the dessert menu- not something I 've seen at other AYCE places)- takoyaki tastes really good ( the flavour is on point!)- grilled squid ( reminded me of night markets, it was very tasty, was n't too chewy at all)- grilled eggplant ( there 's a sweet sauce and it is grilled nicely)- chicken wing skewers ( they 're so good!, the wings are skewed on so the bones are pushed down)- pop is included in the menu ( so no extra charge for all you pop lovers!).</li><li>The menu is much more limited than other places like 168 Asian Buffet and the salmon sushi could use a little more seasoning.</li><li>If you are like me, I usually end up ordering one or two of almost everything on the menu to get my moneys worth.</li><li>It was just a standard AYCE japanese restaurant, despite that their menu is quite larger than other competing japanese AYCE restaurants.</li><li>There was a lot on the menu and the pricing was also pretty good.</li><li>The menu consists of a large placemat-sized paper where you mark off the quantity of the items you 'd like to order.</li><li>Service is quick Menu is n't the biggest I 've seen but still had plenty of options Food overall is just ok- passable but I 've had better.</li><li>The mango yogurt is definitely my fave dessert on the menu.</li><li>Amazing variety of items on the menu.</li><li>It 's a great place with a good variety on the menu.</li><li>I liked this AYCE, they have some unique items on the menu but was not able to try them all.</li><li>Second, they do not have ginger milk as a dessert on the menu.</li><li>Realising we could, we saw that this was the more reasonably priced menu and choose two things to order.</li><li>We then ordered grilled eggplant which was indicated to be vegetarian on the menu and once again, it had tuna flakes in it.</li><li>Menu was a bit limited.</li><li>The AYCE menu is pretty long- lots of options between sashimi, sushi and hot food.</li><li>Other than a few `` house'' rolls and sashimi, the menu is n't that restricted for lunch.</li><li>We came here on a Sunday afternoon for a family lunch and it was super packed inside but they gave us a menu to look at while we waited outside.</li><li>The menu has all these Filipino dishes with some Chinese thrown into it as well.</li><li>Variety: there 's a generous variety of choices to choose from on the menu, perhaps the most compared to other restaurants.</li><li>It was n't fishy at all)- Kare Kare ( it was n't my favorite dish on the menu.</li><li>Overall a great menu I have been ordering ( sit down and takeout although they do offer delivery) for years.</li><li>I had #19 ( seafood and assorted meat egg noodle) on the menu ( see picture) since this place is famous for it.</li><li>But the server had our menu, tea, and utensils as soon as we sat down.</li><li>The menu is rather large, but primarily Vietnamese.</li><li>If you do n't see it on the menu, just ask.</li><li>Pretty much the only place in the area that you can eat something healthy. i 've eaten here for years, everything vietnamese on their menu is bang on portions are good, service is good this place has character people of all color and all walks of life come here 5/5 stars.</li><li>He starts yelling saying, `` you come here in person I cannot explain to you what 's on the menu, you will not like what I tell you''.</li><li>Call ahead of time to make sure what you want to order from their menu is available that night.</li><li>The menu has a reasonable selection with all the standard choices.</li><li>I 'll give them credit, this is the only one item on the menu that clearly stands out.</li><li>The dinner sets at the back of the menu are good, you get a whole lot of food from $ 8 to $ 11.</li><li>One item on the menu that was particularly good is their Kanpung Chicken, a fried chicken served in a spicy chili sauce, it packs some serious heat but well worth your lips going numb!</li><li>The menu offers up pizzas with an over emphasis on their chicken items as well.</li><li>The menu they gave us said $ 6.99.</li><li>She showed me another menu where $ 6.99 was crossed out by hand and had $ 7.99.</li><li>Decent food---lot of choices on the menu!</li><li>The menu was typical Eastern European.</li><li>This place reminds me so much of all the Hungarian Places that used to be along Bloor in the Annex--the strange decor, the menu with the liquor listed at the end, the staff and the way the place fills up at a drop of a hat.</li><li>They have great old world charm, wonderful and attentive staff, many of which know my mother-in-law by name, and an expansive menu.</li><li>This place offers take out as well as dine in options and have a varied menu.</li><li>The only thing I noticed is that the menu indicates coffees do not have free refills ( which is fine, but it appears to be $ 1 a refill), and the spicy is not as spicy as you 'd expect.</li><li>Being a vegetarian AND a Mexican, I was pretty thrilled to see a lot of good veggie options on the menu.</li><li>My fiance is gluten free, and there was a ton of stuff on the menu she could eat, which is a rare treat.</li><li>They do n't have all the items on the menu available sometimes.</li><li>2) The menu has SO much variety.</li><li>You can pretty much pick things randomly off the menu and be pleasantly surprised with most of it.</li><li>The menu is large and they have a whole page dedicated to fried rice and rice dishes.</li><li>Large variety on menu.</li><li>Coworkers and I wanted to order for the Easter Weekend, we made out pics based on the menu on the website.</li><li>They even have bubble tea ( it 's not on their menu but they have the non-flavoured ones).</li><li>They had a lot of pork on the menu.</li><li>And the rest of their menu is pretty good too.</li><li>The menu is as large as the place and the portions.</li><li>I had to use my cell phone flashlight to read the menu.</li><li>The menu is black.</li><li>Menu looked good with lots of options at good prices.</li><li>It 's an extensive menu far too rich to itemize here.</li><li>I shall be back to eat my way through the menu.</li><li>They serve a ton of stuff on their menu and usually they have daily special that rotate weekly which includes tea and soup.</li><li>I sat down and they gave me a different menu from everyone in the restaurant, when my friend got there she asked for the other menu, which clearly was only given to the Asians.</li><li>I ordered one dish and had studied the menu diligently.</li><li>Like other HK style cafes, their menu is extensive, but as I said before, it 's the pork cutlet on rice that keeps me coming back.</li><li>Menu is extensive, but sadly no Thai iced tea.</li><li>We sat down and waited for someone to bring us a menu, they took too long so we just grabbed one from the reserved table behind us that did n't show up.</li><li>The menu is extensive and they actually have a lot of set menu 's ( Bento sets, Sushi and/or Sashimi set dinners, Curry dinners and Vegetarian Dinner sets).</li><li>Firstly, they add tea to the menu, I 've never in my life had to pay for tea while having sushi, and here they charge $ 2, and $ 2 is n't a big deal obviously, however it 's the fact that I can walk 30 seconds to one of probably 15 sushi places in the area and they 'd never even try to charge for that.</li><li>The menu is also over priced, but we managed to find the spicy maki set for $ 13 which seemed on par with other restaurants.</li><li>We get the menu and order 2 thai soups as that 's what we came for, and the man says, `` you need to order more'', and points aggressively to the menu 's fine print which says, and get this ...</li><li>Their menu is n't that big but they 're good at what they do.</li><li>The menu will give you a bit of sticker shock considering the decor and the amount.</li><li>But if you look at the menu, any main you order should hit that.</li><li>The first thing I noticed when I got the menu was that it stated for dine-ins, each person had to order a minimum of $ 10 ( before tax), something that I rarely in restaurants, and kind of unreasonable as most of their main dishes were actually only $ 9.99.</li><li>The menu is small and offers your typical curries and noodles amongst other dishes.</li><li>I looking at their `` take out'' menu and was debating whether I should order Tom Yum soup as a take out or stay in ..</li><li>Pho is offered on the menu, as is the other common Vietnamese rice dishes but I do not know how it fares to their main dish, the namesake of this restaurant.</li><li>The price is reasonable and I will go back to try other items on the menu!</li><li>There are several meal plates on the menu.</li><li>There 's a massive menu, so do n't worry, you have choices.</li><li>Love how easy it is to see the menu too.</li><li>The bubbles have the perfect texture and flavour ( not too sweet, and a hint of tea) and their menu has the same variety as well.</li><li>I like the fact that they have a top 10 menu which allows newcomers to try any of these drinks that wont disappoint.</li><li>#1 and #2 on the menu are what I usually order; not too particular about bbt, but it 's always half sugar and no ice for me: P This place is way too small just like every other Chatime chain there is, be prepared for a 30min line!</li><li>Everything I 've tried on their menu is great.</li><li>I also like that they have a large menu, since sometimes you do get tired of the same ol types of bubble tea.</li><li>- Menu is extensive enough that you can bring a picky eater here.</li><li>We started off with the Soup of the Day ( $ 5)- I forget what the soup was called ( the soup of the day is n't written on the menu but the server will tell you about it) but it was a sort of creamy corn soup.</li><li>I ordered off their chicken pasta section of the menu- the Raffaella ( $ 16)- chicken breast, roasted red peppers, sundried tomatoes, snowpeas, penne pasta, and a rose sauce.</li><li>While I do n't think I 'd order the pastas we got this time again, I would come here again for that creamy corn soup, to try more of their desserts, or to try more on their menu- Paisano 's has a lot to offer and I 'm always down to try more Italian cuisine.</li><li>I ordered my usual linguini and white clam sauce, not on the menu but they always accommodate me, it was delicious as always.</li><li>The menu is laid out in a slightly quirky fashion for the entrees, with a bit of repetition.</li><li>The menu itself seems quite dated ( particularly the photos) and lacked creativity.</li><li>The menu is large and varied, and the portions are very generous.</li><li>I used to also order a great seafood pasta dish with linguine in a tomato sauce, but I have n't been able to find it on the menu lately.</li><li>Perhaps the menu changed, but other than this one thing, I do n't notice any other differences.</li><li>I will definitely be back to try more items on their extensive menu.</li><li>The menu offers up some of your pub favorites like wings, burgers, and beers.</li><li>Everything on the menu was decently priced ( our bill was under $ 20 for two people), and the service was attentive enough.</li><li>The menu is big and has most of your standard items ... my favorite was their sweet and spicy fried chicken.</li><li>Everything else on the menu was actually quite cheap as most things were under $ 10.</li><li>So visit #2 started off with a game of matching what the special combo consisted of vs. items on the menu ( detailed in English).</li><li>The menu says it 's good for 2 people but I swear it 's for 3 people.</li><li>$ 33.99 on the menu ?</li><li>The table next to us had to ask for the menu a million times before they got it and they were there before us.</li><li>Food offerings on the menu are Italian with emphasis on items other than the pastas.</li><li>I 'm not well versed in Italian cuisine, so although the menu had descriptions, it still looked like a foreign language novel to me.</li><li>The price you pay for the food is amazing and they have something for everyone to enjoy on the menu.</li><li>TBH- I am very generic when it comes to Italian food- so half the time I had to google image what I wanted- Ordered the bruschetta and much like everything on the menu it was on the $ $ side for what the value is.</li><li>Meals all seem to come with a chap chae and pancake appetizer that are n't announced on the menu.</li><li>A few staple Korean dishes on the menu are excellent.</li><li>When a restaurant has a small menu like this restaurant, one expects awesome food.</li><li>Looking through the menu, there was so much to choose from .. we all decided to pick one appetizer and one main dish.</li><li>Our Korean server was nice and a great server who knew the menu pretty well.</li><li>A lot of unique dishes on the menu.</li><li>It was a part of the price fixe menu.</li><li>The menu was sooooooooo limited.</li><li>Wish they had more food options on the menu.</li><li>As soon as she arrived, the waitress tried to take our order, which my friend did not even have a chance to look at the menu yet.</li><li>Normally on a regular day, The Thai Islamic, and the Thai Basil Noodle on their menu is super delicious!</li><li>First of all, they 've completely changed the menu.</li><li>My mom had a cocktail and ordered the $ 25 summerlicious menu ( shrimp satay, bass fish, custard) and I ordered the pad Thai and spring rolls off their a la carte menu.</li><li>Fresh coconuts on the menu are wonderful.</li><li>Pros: Very nice decor Good Service Cons: Not much variety on the menu Portions could of been better Hidden automatic gratuity ?</li><li>I would say, a total of 20-25 items on the menu.</li><li>The papaya ice cream also tasted amazing with the mango sauce over it I would definitely go back again to try more dishes on the menu!</li><li>ALLERGIES As with all Thai food, their menu is heavy in shrimp.</li><li>Though, I did n't order it, I was pleased to see they had Thai tea on the menu.</li><li>The menu consists of all your Chinese staples for around the average price.</li><li>FOOD: The menu was fairly consistent with what you expect from any Pho place, so I went with a `` Beef Satay Noodle Soup'' and a HK style tea.</li><li>There was some kind of grease on the menu, ughhh ...</li><li>The waitress left us alone with the menu for so long that we thought we would walk out of the door, and she would not notice.</li><li>Is McDonalds modifying the menu ?</li><li>The menu offers up jerk chicken and jerk pork with some additional items like goat, patties, and rice.</li><li>The menu is extensive.</li><li>I 've had everything on the menu including the festivals.</li><li>I do n't even normally eat red meat, but they had so many lamb things on the menu, and all the scents of the food around us smelled so good, I decided this worth a compromise, and it totally was.</li><li>Every Lamb and Beef dish on this picture friendly menu is AWESOME. go in for a warm lamb stew or chef 's special soup in the winter, or cool garlic cucumbers in the summer. their beef or lamb chinese style pancakes are YUM -- delightfully puffy and filled with perfectly seasoned meat. their house special beef noodle soup is cravable! you can taste the time and love in the soup base. ughh so goooood .. and the hand pulled noodles are as real as they get outside of la chine. seriously ? who cooks like this anymore outside of china ? -- these are classic techniques! the decor is kind of hilarious though, a lil step up from a hole in the wall, it 's definitely clean, but it also feels like you 're in the middle of nowhere china, really really first gen. like you 've escaped the city. and nothing matches. the walls are cheerily painted like you 're walking into the plateaus deep into china, starkly contrasting the leather booths and the crazy yellow seat covers that match the trilingual waitress 's outfits ( they mainly speak mandarin, some canto, and english). the TVs are always playing old 50 's chinese black &amp; white talkies, and there are neon signs boasting great halel food! the chef is usually out and about greeting the customers- he 's won awards for his food, and i agree -- this place is seriously the best regional lamb and beef dishes that 's hit the east side of this city since ... johnny 's burgers. i highly recommend this place! because i 'd be so sad to see it go under because no one knows about it. deserves my YUM YUM approval fo sheezie;).</li><li>They have good menu.</li><li>Not everything in their menu is great but it depends on what you have tasted so far.</li><li>Here 's what I recommend: The spicy lamb skewers sweet and sour soup spicy mini lamb chops There are interesting dishes on the menu like Jellyfish and Oxtail so if you are feeling adventurous go for it.</li><li>Tried like half the menu so far, things I 've never even heard of before and it was all delicious!</li><li>I honestly will need to make more trips to see how the rest of the menu is as the portions are way too large to order multiple dishes for sampling!</li><li>Other than that, menu is slightly above mediocre.</li><li>We went all out with the menu.</li><li>Judging by the look of it outside and the menu, I did not expect to walk into a aesthetically pleasing restaurant.</li><li>The menu is Northern style food that mixes the BBQ with spicy cuisine as well.</li><li>Very good food and service here: the servers were All very attentive and helpful with recommending various choices on the menu.</li><li>The tempura items were ok, nothing else on the menu particularly stood out.</li><li>The menu is all you can eat and you can pick from one of two menus which determines how much you pay per person.</li><li>Upon arriving, the server was very friendly, greeted us and gave us the menu 's.</li><li>What I disliked was that there was no sushi on the 14.99 menu, just Maki Rolls, and no miso soup on it either.</li><li>The menu consists of shawarmas ( Lamb, chicken, beef), falafel, kebabs ( beef or chicken) in a pita or as a platter with salad, hummus, garlic sauce and rice or fries for the meat options.</li><li>With the vegetable combo plate besides everything that is stated on the menu they do also give you pita bread so you can make a sandwich for yourself if you like.</li><li>The menu is pretty standard; kabobs, shawarma, falafel, hummus etc.</li><li>The only notable difference on the menu was that there was a single pork item.</li><li>We were baffled to see that menu looked Lebanese and the waitress was Croatian.</li><li>I 'll be back to try more on the menu.</li><li>Kivas had a change in management many years back- and they have done a great job stepping up the menu and food a few notches.</li><li>Everything on the menu is delish!</li><li>The menu is quite large and in addition to all the egg options you have, you can also build your own omelette.</li><li>You wo n't find any bacon or sausage on the menu here, being it 's Kosher.</li><li>My friend ordered `` The Greens ' Egg White Omelette'' On the menu below all the Omelettes it states `` All omelettes served with toast and home fries'' however when the waitress took our order she told us that the omelette my friend ordered did n't get toast and home fries.</li><li>This last thing is a bit nitpicky but the pictures of the food in the menu looked like they were taken on a cheap cell phone, not appetizing looking at all.</li><li>When we first arrived, I actually overheard the table next to us exclaim that the menu and the food had changed so much since they had last dropped in ~ 7 months ago.</li><li>Seems like it went downhill after the menu has changed.</li><li>Server came back multiple times to ask for our order when we did n't even had a chance to read the menu.</li><li>The menu had a good selection of items to choose from, and most importantly after a day of moving, the pints were cold.</li><li>Menu looked great; however very pricey for PUB food.</li><li>The menu is a bit confusing on a few items and could use to be a bit more detailed.</li><li>The first thing we notice from is that the menu has been changed and of course the price has been increased.</li><li>Limited menu ... furnishings and decorations from 50 years ago ... terrible place for the price.</li><li>The pricing was higher than on the menu and they did n't have XL sizes.</li><li>I have to say they are good for pho, but not so much for other items on the menu.</li><li>It 's nice and open, clean and the menu is quite vast.</li><li>I 've been coming here since it opened, and I 've never been disappointed with anything on the menu.</li><li>Though I 've tried most of the menu, I do n't usually order many of the `` advanced'' HK foods, but companions have always been pleased.</li><li>The pictures on the menu are accurate to what the food looks like and it tastes great. hmm, i see a trend here. yet another `` chinese'' restaurant in my neighbourhood where we waited for ten-fifteen minutes with no server ( and this time we were one of two whole tables in the place). and again, i walked out. i 'd heard decent reviews from friends, never got a chance to see if the food was any good. smells great! poor/nonexistent service.</li><li>Staff are always friendly to us and go out of the way to serve us. consistently great chinese food. this restaurant and all their chains are extremely successful. theres always a lineup .. not sure if thats a good thing or bad thing but the food is great so that makes sense. the service is fast and efficient and take out is easy. ill alawys keep coming back here and their practically open all the time. great restaurant hours. the menu is vast and the assortment is amazing.</li><li>The menu was huge and can be a little overwhelming if you 're an indecisive person like I am.</li><li>Congee Queen is definitely a good place to get some really good tasting Chinese food, and because it has so much variety ( HUGE menu!) its easy to find something to please everyone if you are coming here with a group.</li><li>Pretty much everything on the menu aside from the beverages is a safe choice ( they 're not bubble tea experts after all).</li><li>The menu has some really nice photos of the food -- beware that serving sizes are large, larger than the photos, so do n't order more than you need because you expect the serving sizes to be smaller than they are.</li><li>Takes me 10 minutes to read the menu and next table is done eating.</li><li>They have two menus: a regular menu with very little pictures, and then a `` hot picks'' menu which is full of pictures.</li><li>I could have ordered the entire menu.</li><li>Customer service is not very good. really excellent food, large diverse menu, generous portions. will certainly be back.</li><li>The menu said spicy.</li><li>There 's so much on the menu you could literally try something different every time you go.</li><li>I would visit the Congee Queen again- the menu is extensive ( much more than congee), the food was prepared with care and the staff were very attentive.</li><li>Menu is similar to any chinese restaurant, but I find it much cleaner.</li><li>Ordered calamari ( had a chili sign on the menu which is supposed to be spicy) there was no chili whatsoever.</li><li>For a place called Congee Queen, everything non congee on the menu was really good also.</li><li>Everything on the menu is shareable I find so do n't order too much or you may not finish.</li><li>Food is typical Asian fare although their menu indicates they have `` new taste'' section where some of the traditional dishes are experimental with some ingredients.</li><li>I remembered they used to have a more traditional look with wooden furnitures but this time around the decor had become more modern and the menu was slightly altered.</li><li>Overall the food quality was good and similar to the other location, but the menu has limited options due to the restaurant size.</li><li>Cheapest drink you can find on the menu is $ 5, but that 's just plain small size bubble tea.</li><li>It can get noisy ( especially with the sound of the blender) but I do enjoy seeing other people 's orders, as the beverage menu is quite extensive.</li><li>Overall it was good, and maybe other items on the menu would have been a better value.</li><li>And WHY did n't they tell us so at the beginning or state it somehwere on their menu ?!</li><li>My friends who have been down to Joon 's on Bloor St. said that the menu here is smaller, however this was a fun restaurant with friendly staff and a cozy atmosphere.</li><li>First impression of the menu: cheap prices relative to its competitors.</li><li>The menu also seems to have changed since the last time I was there ( a couple of months ago).</li><li>Hearty comfort food for me! n the mash potato side dish is so yummy too! towards the end when u only have a bit of chicken n pieces of veggies left in ur pan, you can ask them to make fried rice with it. they will bring over rice, hot sauce/sesame oil mixture n mix it all up for u. the owner lady even formed the rice into a heart shape for me n my boyfriend one time. it was too cute ~! the Dak Gal Bee is so good there, every time we go that 's all we get. so i do n't know how the other items on the menu taste. oh and the minimum order for Dak Gal Bee is 2 people portions. service is fine, waitresses are pleasant, but sometimes do n't speak much English, but who cares, food 's good!</li><li>I was super excited for the fried rice, because the menu says that at the end, they put the rice in for you, add sesame oil and seaweed, then mix it up with the remaining sauce and stuff at the bottom of your pan.</li><li>The downsides: Menu is quite limited.</li><li>I 've never tried anything else on the menu besides the Dakgalbi ( because it 's THAT good).</li><li>It took 10 minutes to get a menu, another 10 minutes to finally get a hold of someone to take our order and another 20 minutes to get our food.</li><li>The only complaint is that some of our food was not brought out, this may be due to the Chinese on the fill out sheet not corresponding with the menu or a mistake on our parts but the staff were very friendly to quickly bring us anything they or we missed out on.</li><li>The menu is incredibly diverse as well!</li><li>The menu is AYCE and comes in Chinese and English.</li><li>The menu is good.</li><li>The menu has all the main things you get with hot pot.</li><li>But there 's lots of variety on the menu and the lamb is superb.</li><li>The only thing I found was the menu is a bit confusing.</li><li>I may give Sushi Bong another chance someday when in need of a quick fix again, and may try something else on their menu to see how that fares.</li><li>Dynamite roll seems to be the most popular item on the menu.</li><li>The menu is very limited but with plenty of choices already.</li><li>Came back and wanted to try other things on the menu and bought a White Tuna &amp; Green Onion Maki, Hae Du Bap, and a Small Sashimi ( 36pcs) but there was literally 11pcs of salmon, 11 pcs white tuna/butterfish, 12 pcs tilapia, 2 pcs of hokkigai/surf clam.</li><li>They are quite creative with their menu and presentations.</li><li>Though the menu printed a little chilli pepper beside a couple of items to denote spiciness level, I did n't find them spicy whatsoever.</li><li>So I would recommend skipping this if there 's other items on the menu you want to try.</li><li>Spicy fish fillet noodle soup- my friend ordered this, again there is a chill pepper beside it on the menu but it is actually not that spicy.</li><li>We will definitely come back again and try out other plates on the menu !!!!</li><li>I could have sworn the menu said beef stew noodles like the photos here on yelp.</li><li>I have to say I was surprised to see lamb on the menu.</li><li>MENU The menu had mostly Northern Chinese food style.</li><li>The menu also had variety of noodles shanghai style.</li><li>Large menu that includes dim sum and soup dumplings that rivaled Din Tai Fung.</li><li>Their menu caters to most people 's palettes, the clean decor and decent service definitely helps in securing it as a `` safe'' restaurant to hold a gathering.</li><li>Some popular items on the menu such as shanghai soup dumplings, beef noodle soup are much better at other restaurants.</li><li>They specialize in Northern Chinese, but have a pretty diverse menu.</li><li>Ordered steak and eggs ( one of the simplest things on the menu).</li><li>The menu is gigantic ( pages, and pages, and pages, and pages, and pages, and ...), so there is definitely something for everyone.</li><li>This and the broad menu keep us coming back.</li><li>While there is a large menu to choose from, I have yet to find anything I 've ever actually enjoyed.</li><li>Omelettes- You can choose your own ingredients or choose one of the kinds on the menu.</li><li>The menu seemed somewhat limited and the types of dishes offered seemed more like Manchu-Wok/Canadian style Chinese food.</li><li>The menu is pretty diverse ( in terms of only Italian food! haha).</li><li>So basically you walk in, read the menu, drool, place your order then walk down to the cashier with the number for your table.</li><li>But as soon as I saw this on the menu, I just HAD to get it and I must say that I was very pleased with my selection.</li><li>As for the flow of the place, the menu that takes up the top of a main wall hurts my neck, I always go straight for the ordering station and grab a menu.</li><li>Via = Street | Cibo = Food We ordered three items from the `` all-day'' menu.</li><li>You go up to the counter and order your food from an extensive menu and get a number for your table.</li><li>Good not great for overall food on the menu.</li><li>The Asian server with glasses did n't smile and did n't seem very enthusiastic, smile and I would have given a tip:) Hard to understand the menu since everything is in Italian, it took 5 min of studying the ingredients to understand what was on the menu.</li><li>The Asian server with glasses did n't smile and did n't seem very enthusiastic, smile and I would have given a tip:) Hard to understand the menu since everything is in Italian, it took 5 min of studying the ingredients to understand what was on the menu.</li><li>Protip- Look through the menu in advance, as there is no server to answer question until you get to the cash.</li><li>Ordered: Porkbelly BBQ ( Sam Kyup Sal)* Pork belly BBQ served with mushrooms, onions and veggies for wrapping* You cook this on a BBQ grill at your table* Served with green onions and you can add it to your ' ssam' Green onions with chili powder and some vinegar for you to eat with the grilled meat Ordered: Marinated Beef ( Ju Mul Luk)* Beef mixed with veggies in a sweet sauce* I much prefer this over Bulgogi which I find it to be too sweet* This you also cook at your table with the grill Ordered: Kimchi Stew ( KimChi JjiGae)* It was interesting to see vermicelli in a Kimchi stew* The soup was just spicy enough and not too sour* Usually you eat this with a bowl of rice Ordered: Dumplings ( Mandoo)* These were Mul-Mandoo which means it is cooked in boiling water* You dip this into soy sauce Ordered: Spicy Soup ( Jjam Ppong Tang)* This is usually a noodle dish but this specific one was made without for drinking* It makes a nice dish to order when you are drinking soju* Filled with seafood and veggies Ordered: Seafood Pancake ( Hae Mul Pa Jeon)* There was n't much seafood in the pancake* I did n't really enjoy this Ordered: Spicy octopus &amp; pork* This is a table top cooking with veggies, octopus and pork* You can adjust the spiciness of this dish* Usually comes in 2 portions but we added an extra serving* Because there was so much food it did take a while to cook Conclusion: Now that I 've been back 3 times and tried couple things off their menu, I am convinced that even from their never-ending menu- they serve good Korean food.</li><li>The menu states that it can feed two people but like Chris C said in his review, it could have EASILY fed a third person.</li><li>Very delicious, great value, excellent side dishes and a ton of variety on the menu.</li><li>The menu is in both Korean and English, explaining what the dishes are.</li><li>Be prepared for an incredibly tiny store with a massive menu!</li><li>It was priced at $ 45 and the menu says it feeds 2 people but I 'm sure it could have fed a third person.</li><li>I basically pointed at the picture on the menu and before I knew it there was14 different dishes on the table ( refer to picture and you will see what I mean).</li><li>We had to ask million times for menu, tea, water, bill etc. we were very unhappy about the service and left a small tip.</li><li>So now that I 've finished my ranting and raving about the side dishes ( namely the pancake), onwards with a review of the actual food from the menu, pricing and service.</li><li>They have a huge menu and each come with at least 7 banchan side dishes and a potato pancake.</li><li>The menu might be confusing, so I 'll leave 2 recommendations here.</li><li>It is hard to read the menu.</li><li>However, if you do n't eat spicy food there are not that many choices on the menu.</li><li>If you cannot eat fried food, do n't come here because 99% of the items on the menu are fried related ( since it 's called the Fry lol).</li><li>Although I would n't say everything on the menu are gonna be perfect for everyone, if you find the right chicken, you will find yourself coming back for more.</li><li>Can be VERY spicy so read the menu carefully.</li><li>I love korean bars and as soon as I saw the menu, I knew this would be no exception.</li><li>Decent fried chicken, but the menu can be a little confusing for people not well versed in the Korean language.</li><li>I usually get the aloo gosht or the lamb biryani, best items on the menu in my opinion.</li><li>McDonalds has improved its decor and menu over the years and I have visited this location a few times.</li><li>Today I wanted red pea soup, and although it 's on the menu they do n't have it.</li><li>They have slightly updated the menu but the restaurant is still in a time-warp.</li><li>The building is old, the interior is old, and the menu has barely changed in the 40-plus years I personally have been going to this place.</li><li>Now I would never complain about that ratio ... but here 's the kicker ( s): The breaded strips of chicken had a very odd, smoky flavour which after a hesitant second bite, revealed itself to be a strip of bacon wrapped around the chicken ( um, Jewish neighbourhood and no mention of it on the menu), the two chicken wings had a distinctive metallic flavour, the pork ribs were terribly chewy and dry, the shrimp had a mealy, thick dough around them that was n't even fully cooked through and had a terrible, raw-fish smell and taste that lingered in my mouth for an hour afterward and the chicken balls were ok.</li><li>Simple setup, simple drinks, simple menu.</li><li>As the owner or even manager he undoubtedly knows the menu says all sandwiches come with fries, roasted potatoes or rice, which I pointed out to him.</li><li>I really do hope that there 'll be more selections in the future = D On a separate visit, I had the sweet potato crepe which is a newer item on the menu.</li><li>Workers are friendly and I 'd come here again to try more of their menu:).</li><li>There are always new items on the menu.</li><li>The menu itself is fairly extensive for such a small restaurant ranging from savoury crepes to dessert crepes onwards to shaved ice and a variety of café drinks such as coffee/lattes/teas etc.</li><li>Upon entrance you can see some desserts and a menu in case you are waiting for a seat.</li><li>One of the main reasons my friends and I came here was because of the sweet potato items on the menu!</li><li>The menu is pretty versatile, though it is the typical dessert selection you can find almost anywhere ( but I did n't come here for something new anyways haha).</li><li>There was a mediocre number of selections to choose from despite three different menus ( one menu was just the pictures of another menu, and I did n't really look at the third menu).</li><li>The menu was accompanied by a book of pictures showcasing all of their dishes.</li><li>I definitely would go back to try the other items on the menu.</li><li>WiFi password was provided on the stand up menu as the server was prepping the table.</li><li>I would rather try something else on the menu.</li><li>Before I start talking about the food, this is the cutest place ever*-* it 's not exactly big, but the space is so well decorated, and everything is so pretty and the staff are so nice and ARGH I CAN' T EVEN. anyways. onto the foooood the menu is pretty small, and everything on it is around $ 8-10 dollars.my mom and I split a savoury one first ( mushroom).</li><li>The last thing is that neither the `` photo book'' nor the menu showed all the variety of cakes offered.</li><li>The Chinese items on the menu are not something to recommend though!</li><li>The menu describes it as" ' Hue' style beef &amp; pork with vermicelli soup."</li><li>You can try anything else on the menu such as the BUN or rice dish and equally wo n't be disappointed.</li><li>So we grabbed the menu from a neighbouring table and used the calculator to check the number and it turned out they overcharged about $ 2.</li><li>Large menu with not only lots of pho, but good choices of vermicelli dishes ( bun) and rice dishes.</li><li>Huge menu would attract indigenous or exploratory patrons.</li><li>Also #528 on the menu is a favourite with my friends.</li><li>I will need to pop in more often and enjoy some food as there are a few more things on the menu I need to try.</li><li>The menu has changed quite a bit since the last time I went to a Montana 's.</li><li>There are so many interesting menu items I could have chosen.</li><li>Pros: + tasty food + fast service Cons:- the menu was warn and unatractive- some of the food came a bit burnt.</li><li>The menu was on a clipboard with loose papers.</li><li>One of them was missing the first paper and was replaced with a different type of menu.</li><li>We got 4 tortillas and asked for an extra one which was given for free ( but written on the menu) Overall I would recommend this place during a game that you do not care too much or if you want a low key dinner.</li><li>I 'd say that most of the Japanese items on their menu are pretty much safe choices -- you 'll want to try their udon and sashimi.</li><li>The menu had a lot of options, nothing special or different from regular sushi places, and the price of it was the good part.</li><li>The menu is a bit limited, and the price a bit high, I must admit, but when I need a quick lunch or take-out dinner, it 's a staple.</li><li>Perhaps I did n't order the right items on the menu but I was quite disappointed when walking out- its the same feeling you get when you finish watching a bad movie in the theaters.</li><li>Initially I thought this place was an authentic Japanese restaurant, but then after I saw the menu, I realized this place is another Korean-owned Japanese restaurant.</li><li>When we were ordering, the menu said that all items for lunch comes with 4 pieces of vegetable roll, miso soup, salad, and dessert.</li><li>A specialty roll came exactly as described on the menu, no more and no less, and was fairly average.</li><li>Menu was pretty exhaustive and lots to choose from and lots of space in the restaurant it seems.</li><li>- I have tried almost everything on the menu.</li><li>This place has a simple menu, which makes it nice to come to as a brunch place.</li><li>I ca n't wait to try out other items on their menu!</li><li>The breakfast special is priced very well ( especially before 11am for 4.99) however the menu is a but on the pricey side for a diner. the food quality and taste, did however make up for this. its a great little place to pop into for a more gourmet style diner food experience.</li><li>I 'd be eating some of their crispy fries or slurping up a killer milkshake as they 'd press their noses to the windows examining the menu.</li><li>The menu was standard and since we were only interested in breakfast I did n't really look at the second side.</li><li>I did n't see the final bill but the prices looked reasonable on the menu.</li><li>Dropped in here again but during the day, not a large menu beyond breakfast but the food was still fantastic.</li><li>Menu is a tad on the $ side.</li><li>3.5 stars The menu had a lot of variety and I wanted to try almost everything that was listed.</li><li>For the money I was really expecting more but I will definitely be back to try the other items on the menu.</li><li>I 'll definitely be back to try out one or two other items on the menu ( the caker is up next!).</li><li>Ive been here many many times, and have tried pretty much everything on the menu.</li><li>They had other non breakfast type foods on the menu but the breakfasts is what you come for.</li><li>You can order anything on the menu at breakfast.</li><li>Our server was great and the menu was quite diverse.</li><li>The rest of the items in the menu look reasonable prices.</li><li>The best roll on the menu is the deluxe jumbo spider roll.</li><li>The menu carries all the staples of a typical sushi restaurant, the quality is passable and the portions are good.</li><li>Their menu is quite big and have a lot of options to pick.</li><li>They have an awesome and cheap lunch specials and the rest of the menu is n't bad either.</li><li>The menu had some other cuisine on it which I find strange and unnecessary but at least everything looked appetizing.</li><li>I would see myself trying it out again because other stuff on the menu looked interesting.</li><li>There are a lot of non-Filipino food on their menu but if you 're gonna come here, you might as well try the Filipino food.</li><li>Previously they did n't have pork in their menu at all ... which I found very odd because a lot of Filipino food consist of pork.</li><li>Delicious, fast Korean food, but the menu is quite limited.</li><li>The menu is relatively simple, it 's pretty much just one page and features their main dish- the Soon Tofu.</li><li>Small menu, limited options, but fast service, good tasting food which is decently priced.</li><li>The menu is n't extensive but they know how to get it all done efficiently.</li><li>Due to the lack of variety of their menu ( which I have no complaints about), the food arrives at the table within 5-10 minutes tops.</li><li>The menu is simplistic and really helps to show the images on there.</li><li>Although the menu is really limited, you should probably know that this restaurant is only known for its single type of dish.</li><li>The menu is small with I think only 8 options where most of the 8 are types of tofu soup.</li><li>The menu is limited but, as the name suggests, they 're famous for their soon tofu.</li><li>The menu is short ... several varieties of Soon Tofu plus bibimbap and bulgogi.</li><li>They have a very small menu ( around 10 choices) that they specialize in.</li><li>A very small menu but the staff were very nice, the food spicy and very delicious.</li><li>One of the popular Korean food places around Yonge and Finch, Buk Chang has a very limited menu.</li><li>They have a small menu but really that 's all you need the Korean classics.</li><li>But I mean, seriously, you go to Soon Tofu to eat tofu in boiling soup, not 5-star-hotel-style Korean buffet, so no one should complain about the lack of choices on the menu.</li><li>The menu consists of a few varieties of soon tofu as well as a couple of other Korean dishes, all in all about 10 dishes on offer.</li><li>Everything on the menu is under $ 10 and the beer was $ 4 so this is definitely a great option for a really good, cheap meal.</li><li>The menu only has 9 items but they do them right ( as far as I 'm concerned).</li><li>My only beef with Buk Chang is the limited menu .... ugh.</li><li>In fact, I was n't very familiar with most of the items on their limited menu.</li><li>Simple Menu.</li><li>Their menu is simple- 9 total items listed.</li><li>Menu has only 8 or 9 items.</li><li>The menu was not that big as this place only serves Soon Tofu.</li><li>The menu is limited but they are good at what they do!</li><li>Food not bad, easy simple menu.</li><li>I ll go back again for tofu soup. everything on the menu ( 9 things) is divineness. service is quick, but that 's asian food for ya!</li><li>The side dishes were average, I still prefer Joons or Oh Geul Boh Geuls side dishes but moving on, the menu was fairly simple it had variations of soon tofu, bulgogi and bibimbap.</li><li>I would go again if I were craving soon tofu but I would like to try out the bulgogi there as well. this stuff is addictive .. simple menu, u just pick either the soup or the meat, or bibimbop ... and go from there .. but i tell u, whatever u choose u wo n't regret .. i had bibimbop and soft tofu soup with the seafood .. was fantastic .. i was so full but had to finish everything .. was that good .. usually packed so def recommend going off peak time ..</li><li>Their menu is smaller than most Korean places on Yonge st. However, this only means that they are able to perfect what they have.</li><li>They have a small menu but what they do ( tofu soup) they do amazing.</li><li>The menu had only one page, simple to choose from, easy for indecisive person like me.</li><li>Simple menu, food was delicious and arrived within about 5 mins.</li><li>The process here is fast, and the staff know how busy they get and do n't wait for you to waffle between options- probably why the menu is smaller to limit the need for debate, and if you ca n't decide between two options either order them both or come back again.</li><li>The menu was small, and precise.</li><li>The menu is small and concise, which is perfect because I prefer it over a lengthy menu.</li><li>The menu is pretty teeny tiny, but I like to think it 's because they have perfected the items on it.</li><li>Only 9 things on the menu.</li><li>Menu is tiny, only 9 food items, very limited # of drinks ... was looking for Korean BBQ ribs, none on the menu so I had the broiled BBQ beef which was good, served with a few side dishes, loved the dark little bean type item, not sure what it is though ???</li><li>All their choices are good, I have tried with friends all of the items on the menu!</li><li>The menu is very small but everything is delicious.</li><li>Between 5 of us we got five different dishes so I was able to taste most items on the menu.</li><li>Well not this exact one, it was the original one in k-town downtown Toronto, but they have the same menu.</li><li>Their menu is small, only 2 pages with one page full of a variety of tofu stews and some other traditional korean dishes.</li><li>First the menu are missing dishes at this location.</li><li>#8 on the menu was the beef was extremely sweet.</li><li>Same menu, set up and prices.</li><li>Their menu is small with only about 10 items up for grabs, but its the tofu soup, accompanied with a variety of side dishes, that have people piling into line for.</li><li>Their menu is small but that just means they are specialized in a certain number of dishes.</li><li>The only thing that I was n't happy about is that they do n't serve alcohol beverages when I searched the pictures before going it showed a menu with beer and soju but not the case anymore.</li><li>The food was quick and almost all items on the menu were under $ 10, which quickly filled me up.</li><li>The menu is small with options for the types of ingredients with the soft tofu and the spiciness level.</li><li>The menu is simple but everything you find on that list delicious, especially their hot pots.</li><li>The menu is limited but the food is great and always consistent.</li><li>They really only have 3 items on their menu: bulgogi, bibimbap, and tofu soups.</li><li>Simple menu, but good food.</li><li>The have the menu on point.</li><li>I was surprised at the small menu!</li><li>I 'm not quite sure whether that 's what it 's called on the menu or not, but that 's pretty much what it is.</li><li>Interesting place, menu has less than 10 items mostly for $ 7.08.</li><li>Number 7 on the menu ( i obviously do n't remember the name).</li><li>Despite the limited selection on their menu, the food was delicious.</li><li>Like the other location, the menu is not that extensive but the prices are reasonable and more importantly, the quality is the same.</li><li>Unlike places that boast that they have over 100 or even 300 items on their menu, the fact that this place is about 10, you know that each item will be their very best.</li><li>The menu is simple with only 10 or so items, but it works.</li><li>Besides, the choices of meals are too similar to be considered exciting, and the menu has not changed in ages `` yawn''.</li><li>There are no real lunch specials on the menu, nothing thrilling or exciting for a special deal.</li><li>The menu is very regular and has nothing special. its competitive nowadays, the worse was ... they did not have a quarter of the things they even list on their already limited menu.</li><li>The menu is very regular and has nothing special. its competitive nowadays, the worse was ... they did not have a quarter of the things they even list on their already limited menu.</li><li>ALL of these things were listed on the menu ... they also seem very stinge with everything. servings are small ... which could be a good thing ... i ordered beef sashimi .. that must be the most horrifying color i have ever seen ... it looked like rotting corpse from the walking dead color. just looked wrong .. please see pics. ordered the beef ribs ... it came out jet black burnt ... see pic. why would you bother serving it ? it makes no sense. the dude left a paper on our table and did not take the order, so i brought it to the front since i was going to the washroom ... he then gives me a lecture saying dont give orders to the front desk. i wouldnt have to if your service was better. water was never filled once. the only reason this place gets 2 star is because they had red tuna as a sashimi choice. which btw came out two different colors .. one time it was red .. the second time i ordered it was light pink ... i suspect they gave me F grade fish the second time around.</li><li>The food also came out really slowly, and a lot of items on their menu they actually did not have ( this happened for about 5 of the items we asked for- mostly the desserts).</li><li>Remember it 's my first time here and we have n't had an offer of getting a drink or pre screening the menu.</li><li>Our first set of order which was hardly even six choices from the menu took atleast an hour to be served.</li><li>Their menu does n't have anything unique or special, pretty typical selection for AYCE sushi restaurant.</li><li>I am a purist, so i stick to the traditional a la carte menu, so i can not comment on the AYCE.</li><li>The menu is classic with all the standard offerings.</li><li>I like sitting at the cooking tables but not every item on the menu I enjoy.</li><li>Cons: The menu does n't offer anything inventive or that I have n't had at many other restaurants and wedding halls, but I guess going traditional is n't bad in and of itself, as long as it is good!</li><li>Soup was good, Jambalaya was very mildly spiced, eventhough it is shown as spicy on the menu ....</li><li>The prices at this restaurant are very fair and just about everything on the menu would be considered a good value for the price.</li><li>This North York location has an extensive menu.</li><li>The menu is not very big, but no matter.</li><li>Ordered the ramen from the menu and they did n't have a spicy indicator nor did they ask what spice level I wanted.</li><li>Nothing on the menu looked appetizing to me, not that I 'm saying it was n't delicious because it was AMAZING but it was n't what I was used to.</li><li>Pork bone soup is a must and it 's one of the cheapest dish on the menu.</li><li>Another server proceeded to raise his voice at us and told us, `` You should read the menu.</li><li>I have n't really ventured out to other food items on the menu.</li><li>My girlfriend ordered pork bone soup which was the main reason why we stopped by, because she loves it!:) so i tried a new item on the menu and an app for the both of us.</li><li>I of-course felt uncomfortably and did not want to pay for something that i did not enjoy and on top of all, it was a new item on the menu.</li><li>Service is minimal, basically give you what you need, the menu and water when you sit, chopsticks and bowls after you order.</li><li>Nothing new or remarkable on the menu.</li><li>Spring rolls were decent, and the menu is more vast compared to some other Viet places.</li><li>During that same dining experience, they also accommodated a large group with noisy kids, and a vegan who could n't eat what she had ordered due to a mix-up on the menu.</li><li>Then they gave us the menu with a small order sheet to write our order but forgot the pen.</li><li>Looking forward to going back and trying other things on the menu:).</li><li>We were given a complimentary pot of tea and given time to look at the menu, no pressure to order right away.</li><li>The menu had a good selection of dishes, with the hot dishes clearly identified for people ( like myself) that are not overly familiar with Vietnamese cuisine.</li><li>Ordering is also done by paper and pencil, be sure to specify customizations for applicable items ( usually in brackets after the item name on the menu).</li><li>There 's also ginger `` sauce''- not on the menu but also a Chinese kitchen basic that you can order at no added cost.</li><li>Menu is also in english.</li><li>I do believe they use the same menu for lunch and dinner, which would explain the dinner-like price point.</li><li>You can find some tastey things on the menu.</li><li>The `` all-you-can-eat'' menu advertises pictures of options that are n't actually available as part of the all-you-can-eat deal, and when I commented that this was misleading, I received a lecture from the rude waitress that it 's a really good deal so I should n't complain.</li><li>How is this place--with their overpriced menu, awful food, cheapy decor, and mediocre service--still in business ????</li><li>Their dessert counter was full of various delicacies and the three page menu lended to even the most colorful of palates.</li><li>Their menu is n't very big.</li><li>The menu is n't very big and consists largely of very sloppy sandwiches that have a surplus of salty tomato sauce on white bread.</li><li>Hey, they DON' T have an extensive menu and I love that!</li><li>The menu consists of rotisserie chicken, buffalo style wings, ribs, and some fish and chips ( though the pictures do n't make them seem appetizing).</li><li>I check out the menu to the side and a lady comes out to take my order.</li><li>I ca n't wait to taste much more food from their huge menu.</li><li>Menu is small and focused on exactly what they do best- wontons, beef brisket, fish balls, wonton noodles, rice noodles etc.</li><li>Ca n't really go wrong with any choice on the menu.</li><li>The menu is very simple, and has decent tasty soup.</li><li>We love Chez Cora in Ottawa and Montreal, and although the menu is the same, this Cora 's is simply not as good.</li><li>Once seated and having a chance to look at our menu, a miserable woman introduced herself as our server.</li><li>My son ordered the one egg from the menu, which was laughable in that it was a small scramble with a piece of bacon ( no bread on the side).</li><li>Although this place offers a gluten sensitive page on their menu, which means there are items in the menu which you should be able to order from, ( with fine print targeted at celiac suffered- which I made clear that I was not) the waitress will refuse to take your order and will leave you sitting there while the rest of your group sits and enjoys their meals!</li><li>Their menu is extensive and one has the choice of choosing from their many options ( e.g. fruit, omelettes, crêpes, eggs, etc.)</li><li>As always, if eggs benny is on the menu, I simply must try it!</li><li>One of my party members has a serious gluten allergy, and initially we were pleased to learn about their gluten sensitive menu (*** APPARENTLY GLUTEN SENSITIVE GLUTEN FREE!***) How does that make any sense ?!</li><li>The menu features a mix of Korean and Japanese cuisines including some Korean takes on Chinese dishes.</li><li>They never have the Korean beer, even though it 's on the menu.</li><li>The only reason I did n't give Nak Won a full 5 stars is because, after having sampled the entire menu, I just think they 're sub par when it comes to beef ribs and soon dubu.</li><li>I 've ordered many soup stone bowls from their menu and all are good, and I usually pick them based on whether I feel like having a spicy dish or not that day.</li><li>The menu says they have chicken, pork or beef bibimbap but that 's a lie.</li><li>This is the first time I 've seen barg made of veal and I was surprised that many dishes on the menu were also veal.</li><li>They took food off the table before people were finished and charged us so much more than what appeared on the menu or is appropriate for the quantity of food ordered.</li><li>If I were to rate this restaurant on quality of food alone it would be a 3/5 overall, but the consistency of the food, large portions, big menu, and excellent service keeps me coming back for more and bumps it to a 4/5.</li><li>That said its greasy ( just about everything on the menu)!</li><li>Navigating their menu is like walking around the hallways on the first day of high school.</li><li>When reading the menu I was really excited but turns out the menu sounded better than the food itself.</li><li>When reading the menu I was really excited but turns out the menu sounded better than the food itself.</li><li>Summerlicious was on and we were informed that we could not order from the regular menu.</li><li>My mom got some sort of fish which is no longer on the menu, or modified cause I can no longer find it.</li><li>At any rate, their menu looked appetizing.</li><li>My favorite item on the menu is their spicy tempura mushroom.</li><li>If you 're a RED TUNA fan, you can get it here- and its one of their best fish on the menu ( comes in sushi, roll, and hand roll only, not sashimi.)</li><li>I like the food here; its hot food is especially good, sashimi pieces are large, and the menu has a great deal of variety.</li><li>Everything we ordered from the AYCE menu was very tasty and fresh ( including sashimi).</li><li>The menu has the standard all you can eat options, I do n't think I felt that anything was missing or anything is inventive either.</li><li>I find that the menu is smaller than the other sushi buffets that I 've been to ( Sushi Fun, Sushi Legend) and the food was just average.</li><li>The Friday night/weekend night menu is really awesome.</li><li>Dim Sum there is about par for the course in offerings with a few different options, but the menu seems to change quite often.</li><li>- Costly/unique ingredients ( e.g. baby yu-choy) are cooked using basic preparations ( e.g. just boiled or steamed and served straight-up) and ordered only `` by chance'' ( i.e. not on the menu) as waitstaff walk with trays of plastic bowl-covered plates.</li><li>Their menu features a number of meal specials, which appear reasonably priced for family or group dining.</li><li>Great Falafel and the menu looked great.</li><li>The menu was incredibly limited- especially considering this establishment considers themselves a sushi restaurant -- they did n't even have a proper sushi menu.</li><li>One would think that a surf ' n turf item would be one of the best on the menu.</li><li>The menu is quite extensive and they include quite a few staple dishes associated with this cuisine.</li><li>Tips: the menu has freebies when you order a certain amount, but it 's only applicable if you 're not buying a discounted item in your total.</li><li>I noticed right away that they had some creative additions to their menu: Creamy butter chicken, cheesy beef poutine, savory Asian BBQ, Smokey Maple Bacon &amp; Grilled Chicken Club.</li><li>The food is quality, and their menu has a huge selection.</li><li>Their menu has a Plethora of items ... everything from Pasta, Steak, Burgers, Desserts, Salads, Chicken Fingers ... basically they have everything on their menu.</li><li>It 's quaint inside, the menu is decent and I believe in the summer they have a patio.</li><li>At first, Symposium Café gave off the '' coffee and tea '' vibe and then you dine in and their menu is like 50 lbs heavy.</li><li>Ordered from the date night menu ... not very impressed .. the chicken was very dry had a gross olive paste smothered on it .. the rice was littered with salt and the plate was soaked in soya sauce ..</li><li>The menu is limited.</li><li>The menu has not too many option.</li><li>Over all decent place but with a very limited menu.</li><li>Good:- Our server was attentive and pleasant, great job- Salad was reasonably fresh- Fries were pretty good Okay:- Wings were passable, certainly not `` best in the city'' as stated on the menu Bad:- Ribs ... like other reviews noted I 'm pretty sure they 're boiled, not smoked ... perhaps thrown into some sort of smoker briefly after they 're cooked but certainly not smoked over a long period of time, which is disappointing for a place with `` smoke house'' in its name- The chicken was dry and had very little taste, also not at all `` smoked'' like it says on the menu- The `` pulled pork'' was just ... wrong.</li><li>Good:- Our server was attentive and pleasant, great

bother greeting us, two of the girls stayed at the bar until 10 Mins after ( menu was already on the table).</li><li>Beer makes me happy. this was ok --- SUMMARY --- Plus 's: good place to hang out, decent food, Minus 's: sitting on the patio means breathing all the car exhaust from the cars on Yonge street --- MORE DETAILS --- we choose a platter for two ... it consisted of: very tender chicken ( i picked it up and a piece of meat fell off- SO TENDER) first time i had cornbread- it looked burnt on the bottom, so i just ate the top part not bad ( it would n't ' be my first choice) pulled pork was ok chicken wings were fairly good beef brisket was pretty good .. ribs were kinda dry ... in the end everything kinda tasted the same. fries were good- not too salty. stepping in, the restaurant itself is nice, there are booths or table seating indoors. the main window is a garage front that opens into the patio area facing yonge st. interior has exposed beam ceilings and there 's many nostalgic memorabilia decorated throughout. we ordered a couple of things from the menu 1. spaghetti with beef brisket- yeah i know an experimental dish but i was feeling like spaghetti and if the brisket was good -- you know that would been amazing. unfortunately the brisket was covered in tomato sauce so I could n't taste it in it 's full glory or not ..</li><li>We had a platter known as `` around the world'' which gives you a sampling of all the meats on the menu.</li><li>The owner ( ?) is extremely friendly and personable ( also speaks perfect English)- very eager to explain every item on the menu, which was a bit hard to read.</li><li>The owner can save himself a lot of time if they just revamped the menu.</li><li>I was sort of craving a soon tofu chigae, which I 've had at a couple other places, but the menu did n't have the anglicized names of dishes and I was too hungry to bother asking.</li><li>Just from looking at the menu, you can tell this place is authentic, and about half of it is BBQ combos, drink combos, etc ..</li><li>I was with a bunch of Korean BBQ novices ( myself mostly included) so the owner took his time to explain the menu, the food, the culture, and more.</li><li>Best menu item: hockey pucks and honey beef.</li><li>The menu looks shorter than the Harbor front location but they are good enough to include everything I like ~ Owner reads my mind I love the pan fried chicken dumplings.</li><li>If I have to name one thing I do n't like is I do n't see any congee on the menu ...</li><li>Menu is pricey for Chinese.</li><li>There is a good selection in the menu but food is not great if you are a dim sum fan.</li><li>The menu looked good and we ordered lunch boxes which were ok.</li><li>They were both pleased with the menu.</li><li>The menu, again, really confusing to read, took me a while to decipher where the wing prices and flavours were, and what their drink specials were.</li><li>TL; DR service was terrible, menu confusing, wings n fries still awesome!</li><li>The food consists of the menu served downstairs.</li><li>Have n't had any good experiences when trying anything else on the menu.</li><li>The menu is the same as downstairs.</li><li>Forget the menu.</li><li>The menu is extensive.</li><li>It is owned by the same chain as the Sushi Delight location and they have the same menu basic menu but they have a lot of different dishes that the Danforth location does not have too.</li><li>The waitress was really impatient in explaining to us and we wished that it was stated on the menu itself.</li><li>Their menu is pretty big and they offer more than just sushi.</li><li>The price is generally moderate but some dishes on the menu can be pretty pricey.</li><li>Menu is very reasonably priced and you usual Japanese offerings.</li><li>It seems that the menu is geared towards impressing the Chinese palette for fresh seafood ( i.e. lobster, crab), which- as a herbivore- I ca n't say too much about.</li><li>Varied menu in a nice, diner environment but they are very much focused on the regular customers at the price of the occasional visitor.</li><li>The servers know their food and are always happy to recommend items on the menu.</li><li>My usual order is their Prime Rib ( the lighter cut has been taken off the menu), and the side veggies are now bok choy ?!</li><li>The menu is nothing to excite, unless you are a meat lover!</li><li>The menu has slightly changed, I believe for the better.</li><li>The menu features Victorian-era dishes as well, including Cherries Jubilee ( first created in 1887, to celebrate Queen Victoria 's 50th year as monarch), and Peach Melba ( first created in 1892, named after Australian soprano, Nellie Melba).</li><li>Of course that was n't indicated anywhere on the menu, so while I do n't blame service for it, I do blame for clumsiness on the owner 's part.</li><li>Once I placed my order, the server was trying to take my coworkers menu right from her hand as she was asking questions.</li><li>A few favorites on the menu failed to impress.</li><li>When we sat down we were scanning the menu and trying to decide what we should get ( since I have never had Korean before).</li><li>An oriental single lady walked in and was seated right away, given and menu and within 3-5 mins placed her order.</li><li>I gave this restaurant a 3 because the menu and buffet does not have much variety in it and really disappointed me.</li><li>Sister restaurant to the Great Khan in Markham ( see my review of that as menu and offerings are similar).</li><li>Virtually everyone I knew has good things to say about this place--the authenticity of the `` wok'' taste, the low prices, the homely/cozy atmosphere, the large menu with wide varieties of items, and perhaps most importantly, the fact that it opens well after midnight!</li><li>Still, this has the same great menu ( very extensive) with large portions for good prices.</li><li>The spicy calamari, which is called something else on the menu, was extremely good as well as very fair value for the dollar.</li><li>I wish I could recommend something, but I feel like everything on the menu leaves me satisfied every time.</li><li>Now, given the choice, I would go to Congee Queen any day of the night if I was given the option because their menu is more diverse but still offers the more traditional dishes but I 've observed that CW is beginning to implement some of CQ 's special menu items now like the Soft Shell Crab Fried Rice ( which I thoroughly enjoy).</li><li>Busy Busy!: This place is busy during prime time because of it 's affordable menu and large portions.</li><li>Overall: Bottom line is that this place serves it 's purpose as a Chinese restaurant that has an affordable menu with good noodle/rice/congee dishes and sharing plates.</li><li>I seemed to settle into some go-to choices on the menu but some stand outs include the salt and pepper squid, cantonese chow mein and the shredded pork &amp; preserved duck egg congee.</li><li>A bit overwhelmed, we ordered off pictures instead of just going off the menu itself.</li><li>I always end up there when I am hungry but have no specific craving because everything is tasty on the menu.</li><li>There are so many options, that it does n't matter what you 're feeling for and who you 're with, there will be something on the menu that will satisfy most tastebuds.</li><li>The ambiance was clean, the lighting was bright, and the menu was large.</li><li>They have an extensive menu, with congee and other Chinese delights.</li><li>Outside of congee, the rest of the menu is also well done.</li><li>The menu has all your Cantonese staples and I 've been here a couple of times so I 've sampled around.</li><li>Congee Wong has made many of my sick days a lot more pleasant ... have a sore throat ... cant eat ??? order a bowl of congee ... order some dough fritters on the side ... the warmth soothes the neck and with the pepper sauce mixed in ... the congee is amazing ... dont get me wrong, there are other items on the menu that are wonderful as well ... authentic chinese style ... i have pleased a lot of sick friends by bringing them some congee when they were sick!</li><li>Their menu sounds like it 's italian or french food, but it 's not.</li><li>The interior is very dark though- my mom had to use the flashlight on her phone to read the menu.</li><li>I noticed that everyone who ordered the set menu was getting this chocolate mousse cake, so I was looking forward to that, but what ended up coming was something different.</li><li>Deep fried spicey squid is my fave on their menu but I 've never been disappointed with anything I 've ever ordered!</li><li>Pics needed on the menu.</li><li>We were all a little skeptical as everything on the menu was under 6 dollars, but there was a lot of people eating there, so they must be doing something right.</li><li>The menu is on a large chalkboard at the back of the store.</li><li>Also, bring cash and you pay at the cashier. soooooo, did you hear about what happened to the goldsteins ? how about the shmaltzbergs son michael, i heard he got an earring! no ? really. what a hoodlum. oy a broch. this might make virtually no sense to you at all or it might make all too much sense to you and either way when you are eating in the cramped space that is bagel plus youll hear this conversation in any number of incarnations at much louder decibel levels than in this review. right at the lip of one of torontos jewish areas ( spanning from as far south as eglinton you might say to as far north as sheppard all along bathurst as its spine) sits this boisterous place thats half bakery and takeaway and half sit down. there are classic chopped eggs, tuna, lox, cream cheese, and herring. then they have a bit of middle eastern flair with falafel plates. the falafel are huge and crispy. they also, make a great spinach salad with a huge ice cream scoop of chopped egg- im sure you can get a huge scoop of just about anything on it. and just about anything you get, will come with, as you would expect, a nice big bagel. i always enjoy my food whenever i go- the menu has long been set and they do it well, but i could do with a little less all the bar mitzvah talk. but when in poland ...</li><li>I have to say Il Fornaro has the most extensive menu I ever see in an Italian restaurant ...</li><li>I ordered the following from the prix fixe menu:- Caesar salad- Penne Cacciatore- Cheese cake The menu also came with flatbread as a starter, in which I did the usual Italian way of eating by dipping some extra virgin olive oil.</li><li>Once I made it in I found that the atmosphere was good and the menu had a good variety to choose from.</li><li>The best items on the menu are butter chicken, lamb vindaloo, and shrimp biryani.</li><li>We all had a mixtures of dishes, butter chicken, vindaloo, tikka masala, naan breads and they even did a special of bombay potatoes ( it was n't on the menu!) the food was just divine!</li><li>The menu is quite extensive and offers all kinds of meats like Chicken, Beef, Lamb and even seafood platters.</li><li>The menu has mostly the usual fare, egg breakfasts, pancakes and waffles, a variety of diner meals.</li><li>The menu is n't really that big, I mean there 's basic ramen, hot ramen, `` ramen delicacies'' and some appetizers.</li><li>I come here pretty often and tried most of their items on the menu.</li><li>Those who are familiar with Sonoya should expect the menu to be the exact same.</li><li>I 'm quite confused because the menu I saw yesterday was quite similar to the locations downtown ( slightly less items).</li><li>Since the King of Kings is in the menu, I never have a problem getting it.</li><li>I 'd also encourage you to explore the menu a little bit.</li><li>The menu online threw me off as there are alot more choice on the menu.</li><li>The menu is n't overwhelming ( another feature I appreciate) and there are pictures which helped with my rookie order.</li><li>Menu is old/battered and dispersed in the restaurant, unlike the other Kenzo establishments ... for example, some of the items are found on the wall ( takoyaki and a few other menu items was not listed on the menu but advertised on a piece of paper on the wall), place is also very old, small and cramped- you 're sitting on wood rather than comfortable chairs.</li><li>They 're a small corner sub shop on Yonge and have a rather small menu.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
