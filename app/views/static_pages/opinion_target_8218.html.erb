<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 8218' %><h2>bulgogi dish<br />occurrence: 1</h2><div><ol><li>I still ate it however i did add a lot of salt in the soup so that helped somewhat. the service i would give a 2.5/5 because the employees do n't respond to you, even if you wave down a waiter they 'll just ignore you. i did find my bf 's bulgogi dish appetizing, along with the kimchi. although my gom tang was n't as expected, i will probably be back here on a random night craving for some korean food. i am pretty sure there are better dishes they have to offer. pretty convenient that there 's a private parking lot. ( that 's a plus for me bc we hate looking for parking and paying the ticket in general).</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
