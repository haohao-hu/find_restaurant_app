<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1119' %><h2>dumpling soup<br />occurrence: 4</h2><div><ol><li>My dumpling soup was good though, but nothing you ca n't find at other Korean restaurants in the area.</li><li>I also tried their dumpling soup before i do n't know if it was over cooked or just poorly made it was pretty broken when i got it which wasnt how its suppose to be like.</li><li>What we had: Kimchi soup, dumpling soup, and vegetable soup ( all soups come with a bowl of purple rice and shared side dishes) Taste: 6/10 They give you a little raw egg to crack into your soup, which is a nice touch.</li><li>I ordered stone bowl bibimbap and it was alright, but kimchi chigae was n't great, and dumpling soup was definitely below average and it took them 40 minutes to make it!</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
