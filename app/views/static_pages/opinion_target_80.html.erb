<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 80' %><h2>waiters<br />occurrence: 99</h2><div><ol><li>The dishes are big and the waiters are friendly.</li><li>The waiters are very friendly, and the washrooms are the extremely clean.</li><li>In fact, I can recall as a kid having my dad 's birthday there and the waiters singing rousing, embarrassing numbers that were downright hilarious and borderline risqu√© as far as a seven-year-old was concerned.</li><li>The waiters looked bored by your order.</li><li>Conversed with multiple waiters in both mandarin and English, and they were always gracious.</li><li>Got rude stares from two of the waiters for ordering only one dish ....</li><li>Becoming weary and famished, I tried flagging one of the very few waiters working that Saturday early/mid afternoon ( which is not an unpopular time for the type of food they are serving).</li><li>Prioritizing was clearly not in order at this restaurant and I could clearly see the waiters and supervisors/managers scrambling to multitask orders but not their eggs ( horribly corny pun intended).</li><li>The service was average, as there were not many waiters during the time we dined.</li><li>One of the waiters dropped a cup and did n't bother washing it.</li><li>One of the waiters almost bent over backwards for us, accommodating our very particular pizza preferences ( we wanted half the pizza with marinara and half with pesto), attentively refilling our waters and bread baskets, and just all around ensuring our dining experience was a good one.</li><li>The waiters were unbelievably friendly and personable.</li><li>Our waiters made it that much better with their keen interest to our enjoyment of every aspect of the dining experience.</li><li>She 's lovely but the service is horrible and waiters are rude ...</li><li>We had to flag down waiters all the time just to ask for the items we orders.</li><li>You wait quite the while for a lamb wrap but waiters laugh at the time of delivery.</li><li>I later on found out the reason, it was because I witnessed one of the waiters cleaning the table with a cup of tea that the previous customer drank from; He literally dumped the cup of tea onto the table and wiped it with a cloth.</li><li>The waitresses and waiters removed the empty dishes quickly.</li><li>I do n't like having to flag down waiters to follow up on forgotten orders.</li><li>The service is always efficient and the waiters are friendly even when you order takeout.</li><li>They tend to take their time getting it and I have had to ask different waiters for water on multiple occasions.</li><li>I have been here many times before, and some of my favourite pastas are the following,- linguine clams pasta- shrimp Portabello pasta I wish their waiters would smile a little.</li><li>The waiters barely spoke English and the specials were posted only in Korean.</li><li>Some waiters do not tell us about the special dish for the day unless we asked.</li><li>So it was really quite, and there were only 2 more tables with customers, so customers obviously expect waiters to be attentive.</li><li>But when we went in, there was photoshoot going on for the restaurant, and all the waiters were around it, not realizing that there were customers waiting infront of the door awkwardly for few minutes.</li><li>Yes the price is above average, but when the restaurant is so nicely decorated and the waiters pick every last piece of scrap that fell on the table then I can accept the higher prices- not to mention the food was awesome.</li><li>Seated quickly; the waitress was attentive and easily flagged ( is n't it the most frustrating thing when it seems like all the waiters in a restaurant are giving you the silent treatment ?), and the waitress also `` forks'' the duck off the bone for the crispy duck pancakes entree, which was incredible to watch.</li><li>But the waiters ignore you unless you wave them down ( it was n't busy when we showed up around 5pm on a Sunday).</li><li>That being said, waiters are friendly and do n't pester you too much, so it 's a win/lose situation.</li><li>Yes, the waiters are friendly, however waiting for them to approach you, take your order, bring you the stuff ( e.g. water, food, etc.) took forever, literally more than 30 minutes.</li><li>The place is definitely under-staffed and it 's definitely not the waiters and waitresses faults for not being up to par with service.</li><li>Came on a Thursday night ... only two waiters and the service was extremely slow.</li><li>It was not too busy and waiters can cover all the tables.</li><li>The waiters also speak both English and Cantonese.</li><li>I had to ask for side plates, ask 3 times for a plastic spoon, and kept sending dishes back with waiters that were n't ours BECAUSE NO ONE HAD TAKEN OUR ORDER YET !!!</li><li>Yes, the customer service could be better at times as you do have to often flag down the waiters during the rush meal hours.</li><li>I feel sorry for the busy waiters For individuals with a smaller appetite, this might be a nice place to warm up.</li><li>The waiters were quite nice and checked up on us enough to refill the water right on time and make sure we did n't need anything else, but without smothering us OR leaving us deprived of water and napkins.</li><li>With only two waiters rushing around the whole place, I 'm actually really impressed with the level of service.</li><li>I swear you are better off speaking mandarin with the waiters here.</li><li>I 'm going to base this review on my last visit, and think positive, usually its a terrible time at this particular location because the waiters have not changed in 30 years and they have no personality plus they like to charge you for the bread!</li><li>The waiters hyper and twitchy.</li><li>It was kinda creepy because four waiters and waitresses surrounded our table with the duck and started cutting it up.</li><li>The waiters were quick in collecting our plates and did n't make me feel rushed in anyway.</li><li>Especially if I feel that the tips are n't going towards the waiters.</li><li>No more waving, or calling waiters over.</li><li>The waiters are very disrespectful and it damages the restaurants overall quality.</li><li>But I found the waiters pleasant the desserts great.</li><li>The waiters are always attentive to your needs and comes to fill your glass up with water without you asking.</li><li>The very first thing that I have to mention is their EXCELLENT level of service and degree of attentiveness.* appreciative applaud* The waiters would check up on you every now and then to make sure you 're doing okay with everything.</li><li>One of the waiters rolled out an anti-slip mat leading from the kitchen to part of the dining area onto the floor.</li><li>It had disappeared and the waiters acted like they had n't seen it.</li><li>All the waiters seem super busy and they even forget their smile.</li><li>The waiters are n't that nice either.</li><li>The place was really clean and the waiters were really friendly.</li><li>The waiters we 're uber nice though lol !!!</li><li>The waiters were attentive and were easy to flag down if you needed anything.</li><li>The waiters were very pleasant as they were very helpful in helping me and my friend make a selection, as it was our first time trying Soon Tofu.</li><li>The rice is later scraped out by one of the ( good looking Korean male!) waiters so that you can later pour your extra soup into this bowl to flavour the rice still stuck on the side of stone bowl.</li><li>Definitely going to return here very soon .... prompt, friendly waiters do n't hurt either;-).</li><li>The service was horrible, and the waiters were n't helpful at all.</li><li>The waiters are generally friendly, but amount of sushi delivered were often less than what was ordered.</li><li>The sushi was n't fresh, the waiters showed no interest.</li><li>Do n't expect the waiters or the busboys here to acknowledge your existence.</li><li>The waiters are nice but the place gets packed late at night so be ready to wait a bit sometimes.</li><li>The price is decent and the food 's great. the waiters are always pretty nice and things are served pretty fast, even during rush hours.</li><li>Service can be amateurish and non attentive and the waiters feels too relax gossipping within themselves.</li><li>The waiters started clearing our personal dishes before we had stopped eating.</li><li>The Waiters are friendly and attentive.</li><li>I recommend this place for their food and not their service ( waiters are fast, but not very friendly nor patient- I do n't know if they are burnt out or what, but they never look very happy) ...</li><li>All waiters are great also get Zaffron Bread.</li><li>The waiters are friendly, and ours even explained the history of koobidehs, which was quite interesting.</li><li>Also because of the tight space waiters were slower because they had to wait until someone passed.</li><li>Many times we could see our food ready on the ledge but the waiters were nowhere to be seen.</li><li>This one time, my friend was paying with credit card, and one of the waiters got really stressed and accidentally ( or maybe on purpose) cancelled the transaction after taking the machine away from my friend ... and he had to do it again.</li><li>It is a really comfortable place for sushi and the waiters and waitress has really good servings ( it 's really fast).</li><li>The waiters were quite tentative in collecting empty dishes as well as exchanging the plates full of lobster shells with clean plates.</li><li>When we dropped by here for lunch on a Sunday, there were probably 6 waiters working along with around 12-15 customers.</li><li>The waiters not familiar with how to deal with costumers at all.</li><li>For the most part, the waiters &amp; waitresses are good and the service is good.</li><li>When I 've gone mid day for a late lunch, St. Louis is quieter and the waiters seem to have a bit more breathing room.</li><li>My experience with tako sushi was not as bad as others but I will agree that the waiters are not the best.</li><li>Atmosphere was nice and quiet, service was decent, waiters were pretty friendly and helpful.</li><li>Most of the time they get the correct order, but usually it 's a fairly slow service where most waiters speak little English.</li><li>The young male waiters would chatter between Mandarin and Cantonese and seem to have no sense of what good service means; do n't expect thank you 's or any polite nods.</li><li>Blarring tv, kids screaming cold eggs and complaining waiters Used to be good about 3 yrs ago and all the noise and drama was worth waiting in line on a Saturday for the food but the food got terrible too.</li><li>I stood by the cash register for about 5 + minutes to order my meal with several waiters passing by.</li><li>I finally had to flag down one of the waiters to get their attention.</li><li>The Highlights:- This place is gorgeous both inside and out- Ample amount of seating for both small and big groups- The waiters are all very professional and seasoned in the food serving business ( you wo n't find your neighbor 's 16 year old kid working here)- Free hors d' oeuvres at the start of your meal ( pickles, olives, cottage cheese, and garlic bread)- Reasonable prices ( all main entrees come with a salad or soup of the day ... a good amount too)- Parking is a plenty and free- Desserts are made on site and delicious ... and you can get it for a low price- Bottomless coffee for $ 1.75- Quiet so you can carry on a conversation with your dining companions I will definitely be back.</li><li>One of the waiters was very rude when we tried to explain the situation.</li><li>All the waiters are rude, unresponsive and disrespectful to us!</li><li>I talked to one of the old waiters, and he said that they are using better grade beef but it does n't taste any different to me.</li><li>We did not see a waiter through the evening unless I had to flag him down because usually there are waiters every few minutes to come by and top of your water or freshen up your appetizer tray &amp; pour your wine.</li><li>Service: Despite having a call button, there were only 3 waiters so we had to keep reminding them to bring us water and food/drinks that we ordered.</li><li>I feel like the salads are n't very fresh: ( Also, I find that every time I 'm there, I always feel rushed by the waiters because they constantly remind me they close at 3 and we need to finish eating soon.</li><li>The waiters and waitress do n't smile and can, at times ignore you, just like in Hong Kong.;-) 2) The prices for how much you actually get 3) The taste for how much you pay These three things, when considered as a whole, forces me to give it a 5 star rating.</li><li>At around 9:50pm, we were the last table occupied, and the waiters started to give us evil eye.</li><li>Service can be slow and the waiters are not always on the ball, but they are polite.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
