<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 162' %><h2>bulgogi<br />occurrence: 40</h2><div><ol><li>I normally get a bulgogi dinner box which comes with sashimi, dynamite rolls, rice, bulgogi, green salad, miso soup, potato and chap chae for $ 11.95.</li><li>My friend had the daily special, which was shrimp tempura, bulgogi, salad, some rolls and I believe rice, there was also miso soup for only $ 7.95.</li><li>The menus were fairly substantial, offering everything from cooked food ( yakitori), noodle soups, the standard sushi fare, and even a few Korean dishes ( bulgogi, etc.).</li><li>To be honest, I felt the bulgogi was slightly underseasoned and the karaage was n't anything special.</li><li>I got the bulgogi which was very tasty ( portion and price were reasonable), my friends got the dol-sot bibimbop ( portion was a bit on the small side but looked quite delicious), and naengmyeon ( generous portion size and perfect for the hot weather we 've been having lately).</li><li>From bean curd soup, pork katsu, sushi, sashimi, kalbi, bulgogi, bento boxes, amazing tempura Udon and much much more. + + + + the atmosphere is cozy and quiet despite being right beside Sheppard ave. Great friendly service from this Korean owned restaurant!</li><li>Free: miso soup, tofu appetizer Bento box: tempura ( good), salad ( meh), 6 california rolls ( good), chap jae ( ok), bulgogi ( ok) My friend told me their chirashi is good and that their fish is really fresh.</li><li>We had a group of 6 and ordered a set meal that came with noodles ( and some veggies) in soup, seafood pancake, Tangsuyuk ( Sweet, sour, and crispy pork), bulgogi in a pot where the server cooked for us, and pork bone soup, and of course several side dishes.</li><li>On to the BBQ, we had bulgogi ( marinated beef), kalbi ( beef ribs), marinated chicken, and pork stomach ( bacon).</li><li>The bulgogi was quite tasteful, and the kalbi is the usual fare.</li><li>The bulgogi was nothing special, but decent.</li><li>It 's gotta be bulgogi to be GOOD!</li><li>It started to get pretty frustrating, since lettuce wraps for bulgogi is essential before the meat gets cooked to a crisp.</li><li>This place is our all time fav and we come back regularly for our bulgogi cravings, but it does get quite busy on the weekend.</li><li>Our bulgogi hot plate arrived and it was n't even hot!</li><li>The Bulgogi was a bit on the dry side though.</li><li>I have had their bulgogi and Kimchi Soon Tofu.</li><li>The side dishes were average, I still prefer Joons or Oh Geul Boh Geuls side dishes but moving on, the menu was fairly simple it had variations of soon tofu, bulgogi and bibimbap.</li><li>I would go again if I were craving soon tofu but I would like to try out the bulgogi there as well. this stuff is addictive .. simple menu, u just pick either the soup or the meat, or bibimbop ... and go from there .. but i tell u, whatever u choose u wo n't regret .. i had bibimbop and soft tofu soup with the seafood .. was fantastic .. i was so full but had to finish everything .. was that good .. usually packed so def recommend going off peak time ..</li><li>My go-to dishes are the kimchi soon tofu and the bulgogi.</li><li>The Broiled beef is just bulgogi that is cooked on a stone pot.</li><li>Not only do you get the soup that fills your tummy with superpowers ( hell yeah), but you get a big bowl of rice and unlimited side dishes! unlimited !? yes.* great place to meet a friend that you have n't seen for awhile* hell, eat solo there too, plenty of seats ... but expect to wait a bit during the supper time 6-8:30pm ? roughly. waiting time is no more than 15 mins max cheers and enjoy! if you 're 3 or more, order the sizzling bulgogi on the hot plate to share !! when you have something that sizzles, you ca n't go wrong.</li><li>My fianc√© always gets the bulgogi, I mix it up always but every soup is good:) I love their purple rice !!!!</li><li>Their bulgogi is also really tender and tasty.</li><li>If you do n't want stew, they also have bibimbab and bulgogi.</li><li>The beef is marinated well for the bulgogi.</li><li>They really only have 3 items on their menu: bulgogi, bibimbap, and tofu soups.</li><li>Got the bulgogi in the stew ( tastes awesome, and comes with glass noodles, tastes like a sukiyaki but better).</li><li>Their bulgogi is alright, but I prefer the bulgogi from a restaurant across from them.</li><li>Got the bulgogi which was soggy and drenched in oil.</li><li>I was here last night for the first time ever and my overall experience was OK .. my boyfriend had been here before so i assumed it was n't a bad place to eat. he had bulgogi ( korean beef) with rice, and i had gom tang/ gomguk ( like assorted beef soup with rice) i was not impressed with my gom tang, it hardly had any taste to it. literally it tasted like water, not that water has any taste- but that 's my point; it tasted like nothing!</li><li>I love the bulgogi !!</li><li>We ordered food to go:- bibimbap ( 3/5) Pretty good but I guess not the best take out option- bulgogi ( 4/5) Very yummy and not overly greasy- glass noodles ( 5/5) Delicious!</li><li>I 've often brought friends and suggested they order some meat katsu, bulgogi, kan poong ki ( sweet &amp; spicy chicken) or bi bim bap ( veggies, rice, beef, fried egg, &amp; spicy sauce).</li><li>They food is pretty decent, I usually have the pork bone soup, the mackerel with tofu soup or the bulgogi in soup.</li><li>My friend had the bulgogi and she really liked it.</li><li>I could have used more of the bulgogi because the amount of protein seemed a little stingy.</li><li>The bulgogi tasted pretty good, but it definitely was n't what I would consider spicy.</li><li>Spicy Bulgogi ( $ 8.95)- with 8 piece of spicy rolls- my DC commented that the bulgogi is a little spicy, but of course I found them to be A-OK Lunch Combo Special B ( $ 15.95)- the fish selections are just little boring: Salmon and Tuna- Good big portion but the price to match too- Shari rice is nicely prepared Waitresses here are nice and smiley, services are good and efficient.</li><li>I assumed she 'd bring pork but she came with some small pieces of bulgogi looking meat.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
