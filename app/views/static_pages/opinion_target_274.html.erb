<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 274' %><h2>plate<br />occurrence: 15</h2><div><ol><li>A simple plate of Barg ( tenderloin) set me back $ 20 tax included.</li><li>The food was also surprisingly good, and portions are unusually generous: The salmon sashimi lunch actually has enough pieces to not leave you still hungry yet does n't cost an arm and a leg, the bento box was varied and tasted good, and when I tried the kalbi dinner, the plate was stacked with so many large pieces that it puts to shame most other kalbi entrees I 've tried.</li><li>My plate was also a recommended top ordered item on the menu.</li><li>Beef tataki sashimi, herb tuna sashimi or something like that, maguro hand roll .. actually hand roll because there 's too much rice, scallop sashimi- ordered ONE and it came out as a small plate unlike how the rest of the sashimi is served.</li><li>The salad and bean concoction were both good additions to the plate but are not items that qualify to boost them to a three and hence a recommended eat.</li><li>Sure, the plate was gigantic ... but it was a huge mound of soybean sprouts !!</li><li>The large amount of garlic paste and hummus on your plate is also worth noting!</li><li>The waitress was nice enough to ask me what 's wrong with the plate when she saw that the entire plate was unmoved.</li><li>The food came on a small plate where everything is little in portion.</li><li>The owner explained that they pour water in before serving because the plate is sometimes too hot and it will burn the food.</li><li>Definately tasty but to much of the plate was showing.</li><li>We said okay no problem, THEN another 15 minutes later we get our cucumber maki roll and the plate was DIRTY, oily, had fish pieces and mystery crumbs.</li><li>The best part of the plate was a garden salad on the side, which was okay.</li><li>Ordered from the date night menu ... not very impressed .. the chicken was very dry had a gross olive paste smothered on it .. the rice was littered with salt and the plate was soaked in soya sauce ..</li><li>I do n't mean to be a snob or anything but I do get a hearty chuckle when I see a group of people order rice or noodle dishes just for themselves partially because the plate looks ginormous in front of them and partially because I cannot fathom how they can finish it: P.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
