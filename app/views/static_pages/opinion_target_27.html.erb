<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 27' %><h2>Beef<br />occurrence: 308</h2><div><ol><li>Waitress: Potato Me: Beef and Barley ...</li><li>They have the best Turkish kefta mix to flavour ground beef, or better yet a mixture of beef and lamb.</li><li>I told the waitress `` NO ONIONS, NO EGGS, NO CHICKEN, NO BEEF, NO SEAFOOD, and NO GREEN PEPPERS ( the green peppers was a choice).''</li><li>Overall 2/5 portion was good, price, and taste of the rice was lovely, the beef was a bit bland, and presentation was satisfactory.</li><li>Like most sushi restaurants they have lunch deals -- which are bento boxes of your typical beef, chicken or salmon teriyaki meat, rice, salad, soup &amp; fried tempera.</li><li>The Manti- Bucharian beef and lamb dumplings were outstanding The Last Samurai Sushi was soo good my wife decided to take another one home ... she said that it was the best sushi she had ever had in Toronto!</li><li>We tried the falafel appetizer, kabob ( mixture of beef and lamb), chicken tabaka ( also known as butterfly chicken), and the salmon dish.</li><li>The color was kind of off- all sashimi had a warm taste and it was covered in water- it just did n't taste pleasant, we ordered a second round of sashimi .. same thing Rolls- Our roll order was forgotten on the FIRST ticket .. mmm .. we ordered their signature roll .. it was really meh .... and the nori was chewy handroll- the Nori was very soft when it came ... portion of rice to filling .. rice more .. filling a bit .. no good Hot Food- beef roll enoki, and green onions, short ribs, grilled shrimp, grilled cutlet, grilled mushroom, grilled beef, grilled chicken heart, etc etc ( The shrimp did not taste fresh again) but overall the beef were all pretty good! ( or 2nd order some of the grill items were once again forgotten !!!! they were n't even full for the evening !!)</li><li>The food I liked today includes the short ribs, sakura rose sushi, skillets, chicken kagame, calamari, takoyaki, beef and mushroom wrap.</li><li>The beef was so tender and delicious.</li><li>The beef teriyaki uses good beef unlike other restaurants I 've been to.</li><li>He ordered the beef and yam sushi which he always gets and loves.</li><li>It made me think of eating beef.</li><li>The menu does n't have an extensive selection of meals as other Viet restaurants but they do have the basics of spring rolls, pho ( beef and chicken), pho beef stew, rice and noodles.</li><li>Beef was also slightly over done.</li><li>The beef are fresh and just perfectly done every single time ( never over cook.</li><li>I hate well done beef in a pho).</li><li>The batter was soggy and was more like a thick fish n ' chip type batter, the beef tasted like 2 day old roast beef and it was cut very thick.</li><li>Had lots of pork, beef, shrimp and vegetables.</li><li>In terms of what we ordered: Mussels- excellent Chicken souvlaki- great Prime rib- no good, dont order this Garlic bread- excellent Steak and shrimp fajitas- steak not so good, shrimp was excellent Seems like they are n't too good with their beef, but everything else was great.</li><li>Beef Bone Soup with Rice Cake and Dumplings ( $ 9.99) has a nice a dedicate flavour.</li><li>Being vegan, I have to exclude the beef and egg from my bibimbap, so the variety, freshness, and flavour of the veggies is what I look for.</li><li>Beef was also very sweet, and excellent bowl overall.</li><li>I got the beef and mushroom bibimbap.</li><li>In fact if I did n't know it had beef, I would not be able to tell.</li><li>Not AS crispy as the beef, bit less sweet.</li><li>None of us went for the seemingly notorious ginger chicken, but from what I can recall, the sweet and sour chicken balls, the fried dumplings, the chicken thing my gal ordered, and the crispy beef were all delicious, served fast, and priced right.</li><li>I focused on the non-fried beef and chicken dishes with the sauces on the rice from some of the other dishes.</li><li>The two standout dishes of the night were crispy ginger chicken and crispy beef.</li><li>The beef came in thinner strips and was caramelized to the point of delightful, near-jerky chewiness.</li><li>Quick eat Crispy ginger beef came burnt as shit and they did n't slice up the beef.</li><li>Ordered the House fried rice with beef and broccoli.</li><li>The beef was tender and the broccoli was also soft ( which was weired texture wise but was ok by me.).</li><li>Highlights for me were the crispy chicken, crispy beef, chili chicken, and sizzling shrimp with scallions and ginger.</li><li>Cutting through the Carne was table-shaking teeth-grinding madness, Beef was Flank variety Minute Steak style thickness.</li><li>The service and quality of food is extremely disappointing as chicken was their only option since they burned their beef.</li><li>Curry Goat Roti: $ 7.95 Beef Roti: $ 6.95 Eggplant Roti: $ 5.95 ( prices as of Aug 2014, before tax. cash or debit only) Both times we got Peanut Punch to drink ( $ 1.50), which is a fun Jamaican treat.</li><li>Good szchewan beef and Cantonese chow mein.</li><li>Therefore, my rating is based on the overcooked noodles and beef that is n't raw when served.</li><li>We go there or Pho more particularly Beef tendon, lean beef, and tripe and for Tom Yun soup for my wife.</li><li>Rare beef was not rare, and the beef balls were cold, so I had to submerge it in the soup and save it for later to eat.</li><li>Though overcooked rare beef is common at chinese pho restaurants, I have NEVER had a cold beef ball before, this was the first.</li><li>I love the Duck with Konjac and the cold beef and tripe with five spice.</li><li>Saw a guest ordered a dish in the hidden menu, called beef in sour soup.</li><li>It was my idea to visit Hot Spicy Spicy because I remember from previous visits to this plaza that from the outside, they advertise Beef Noodle and that is a natural attraction for me.</li><li>The BEEF was very tender in my opinion and the Cilantro/Scallions gave a bit of fresh flavour to the saltiness.</li><li>The beef covered in hot oil and spices in a bowl used to be better but something has changed about it.</li><li>Lots of beef.</li><li>The portion was very good for its price, I am surprised at the amount of beef they put in.</li><li>My parents had #42 Pho Dac Biet ( Special Pho, which contained rare beef, well done beef flank, brisket, soft tendons, tripe and meat balls).</li><li>Lots of tender slices of beef.</li><li>They put SOO much beef that I had large pieces of beef still left by the end of my meal.</li><li>I had my usual pho with rare beef.</li><li>I ordered their pho with well done beef and beef tendons.</li><li>The broth was flavourful, and had a good amount of beef and tendons.</li><li>The broth is tasty and they give you a very good amount of noodles and beef.</li><li>When I got home I realized that they literally gave me frozen beef.</li><li>Not rare beef, FROZEN.</li><li>That 's rare beef, tripe, tendons, beef balls plus the noodles and broth for $ 6.50.</li><li>Beef.</li><li>The server had told us in advance that the beef is served medium rare, which was fine, because we usually order meat rare to medium rare.</li><li>The beef was average in taste and extremely fatty.</li><li>A whole section of the menu is devoted to burgers, beef and otherwise, all sided with serviceable slaw and regrettably frozen fries.</li><li>The beef was cooked to pefection.</li><li>Food wise, I got the beef ( medium).</li><li>Beef Barley: it was a little bland, I 'd add Lil more salt &amp; pepper, coriander, Lil lemon and garlic.</li><li>Try their beef, lamb or chicken kabob, way better than Lahore in Little India.</li><li>My family and I went here for dinner last week and ordered chicken biryani, beef seekh kabobs and chicken kabobs with naan, Naan 's were very good, fresh out of the tandoor oven along with the beef and chicken kabobs.</li><li>The spicy mustard that went with the rye bread and the beef made the dish all the more salivating and I took home a pound of the corned beef following my meal ...... three homemade sandwiches later with Wolfie 's meat, I 'd still go back for more I quite liked the friendly man who served us the two times we went.</li><li>This one did, the beef was rubbery and dry as if it was microwaved then served on to a hot plate.</li><li>I ordered Beef Teriyaki U-dong ( as written on their menu) and, well let 's just say after finishing my meal, I ordered another one to go.</li><li>But must mention the following too:- Line up to pay- Onion grilled with the skin still on ( from no frills to the grills)- half chicken not fully cooked inside but burnt outside- too much tahini in the hummus- beef a bit dry Other than that the rest was good.</li><li>The beef was very tough- could n't stab it with a fork and had to use my hands.</li><li>Unfortunately the beef was dry.</li><li>The beef was kind of dry, which the sauce had to make up for.</li><li>The chicken and beef tasted juicy and their garlic mash sauce tasted really delicious.</li><li>- Nope!)- No Pita bread, but seemed like sausage buns that were tunred into a type of Garlic Bread ( WTF, right ?)- Lemon Potatoes seemed like they were cooked in Campbell 's Vegetable Soup and had an orange colored sauce on them ( Really, Campbell 's ?)- Meat was of a lower quality and smaller size chunks- beef was heavily spiced which is never a good sign when eating meat.</li><li>I tried my boyfriend 's steak &amp; ale pie ... tasty tender beef chunks and really good pie crust.</li><li>I had ordered the beef in the past and wanted to try something different- preferred the beef to the chicken for sure.</li><li>I had ordered the beef in the past and wanted to try something different- preferred the beef to the chicken for sure.</li><li>I also enjoyed the Korean beef with purple rice as the beef was soft and sweet.</li><li>FOOD I had my same pho with rare beef, beef intestine ( they say it more eloquently on the menu).</li><li>We get the same things every time: a large pho with rare beef, brisket and tripe, a Vermicelli salad with either grilled pork or chicken, a small plate of spring rolls.</li><li>My favourite is their Bun Cuon and pho with rare beef and beef balls.</li><li>Eat a lot of pho with my buddies and this place was the recommended spot if wiling to make the drive ( close to my fiancée 's house) I love the thicker noodles as compared to other places and even though my well done beef is NEVER well done I still love this place because that seems to be the norm I usually get well done beef with beef balls and always enjoy the meal despite the mountain of fat that ends up beside my bowl A place to try if you have not already.</li><li>If I do n't plan on eating it right away, I freeze the rare beef and then just boil it later with the soup before dumping the noodles in.</li><li>I had the rare beef and brisket pho and my nephew had the rare beef and meatballs pho.</li><li>I had the rare beef and brisket pho and my nephew had the rare beef and meatballs pho.</li><li>Pho with rare beef and beef balls- Noodles was decent, but standard.</li><li>The beef short rib is usually my favourite, but this time the meat was too fatty.</li><li>Love the beef short ribs and variety of fresh, delicious hand crafted sushi that they offer here.</li><li>The noodles, tempura ( veggies only, the shrimp was meh), beef and rock shrimp were the highlights.</li><li>I ordered everything from salmon rolls, spicy seafood udon, grilled chicken and beef, seaweed salad, and a variety of other items on their packed lunch menu.</li><li>Service is quick and friendly. went for lunch before and went again for dinner, the sashimi were fresh and thick cut the way they are suppose to be and the beef and the scallop sashimi was delishhhhhh !!!</li><li>I usually order the beef or seafood ramen as well.</li><li>Sul Lung Tang- Beef Bone Soup ( $ 7.95) a milky, cloudy soup with wheat flour noodles serves with rice.</li><li>Beef Bone Soup supposed to have simmered for over 12 hours and have this comforting effect and give Korean the I am at home vibe ....</li><li>We sat down placed our orders, I took the beef and garlic rice dish, my friend took a Korean beef steak dish, and the third guy took a shrimp and rice dish.</li><li>The beef in my dish was tender, garnished with a lot of onions and some brocoli and a large serving of rice.</li><li>I went there and I ordered a large rare beef to go came hone and I had 3 pieces of meat and almost no been sprouts I was pissed I called and complaining because obviously I was hungry and I wanted more than three pieces of meat she said oh well the chef put the same amount of meat for all of them so I got even more mad nice excuse me I paid for a large you 're telling me that they put the same amount and regardless of the size so why would I be paying for a large and getting a small you 're ripping people off she would n't do anything for me saying I 'm not in control I ca n't do anything next time I 'll just give you more meat I want it was so mad Plus to make matters worse my boyfriend went and walked into the kitchen and it was filthy there was literally a bowl of meat sitting on the floor it was disgusting boy caught it I swear to God I will never ever ever ever again it is disgusting and they are rude and they rip you off I wish I could knew how to delete my old review.</li><li>Regular size Pho- I expect more than 4 thin slices of beef!</li><li>I then moved on to asking what kind of beef and chicken dishes they had with garlic and a soy sauce base.</li><li>The beef I had was good.</li><li>The beef was okay.</li><li>The beef was tough- pieces of steak not ground beef but the beef was chewy and not cooked through.</li><li>The beef was tough- pieces of steak not ground beef but the beef was chewy and not cooked through.</li><li>The beef was melt in your mouth tender, the sauce was a bit spicy for my taste, but he enjoyed it. ( we asked for next time, and you can request a milder sauce) We 'll definitely be coming back for more !!</li><li>Some of the beef was more chewy than the rest but overall the dish was good.</li><li>The beef was OK nothing special also sweet for some reason.</li><li>Rice Noodle with Beef and Black Bean Sauce ( $ 7.95) has the same rubbery beef, tons of noodles but not enough sauce.</li><li>I just got home and the beef is completely burnt and disgusting ( I can post a picture if anyone is interested).</li><li>The soup was awful, the beef was okay just not much flavor, The tempura shrimp were good and the Cali sushi that came with it was simple like grocery store simple in taste.</li><li>Definitely a ginger chicken, pineapple chicken curry, golden beef, some vegetables and another curry and all of it was really good.</li><li>Beef was tender, the butter chicken was flavorful and the cheese naan was unlike anything I 've ever tried!</li><li>We ordered the Goi cuon ( Beef and pork summer rolls) to start.</li><li>Boyfriend had the Pho Tai Gan Sach which was made with well-done beef, beef tendon and beef tripe.</li><li>The beef was a little overtenderized and the tripe was cut too thin in my opinion.</li><li>Started off with Goi cuon ( Beef and pork summer rolls) Rice paper was inferior &amp; contents were not at all flavorful.</li><li>Bun Bo Hue is a spicy noodle dish made of beef, pork &amp; vermicelli.</li><li>I ordered Pho Tai Gan Sach which consists of well-done beef, beef tendon &amp; beef tripe.</li><li>The beef was overly tenderized &amp; the tripe was cut way too thin &amp; the soup base was a downer.</li><li>I love their beef and veal dishes.</li><li>It was barely warm, and the overall amount I got was n't worth the price ( and very little beef was added).</li><li>The beef was marinated very well, plentiful, and sweet.</li><li>It was dry, beef was tough and there was hardly anything in it.</li><li>After seeing many reviews, I wish we tried the crispy beef.</li><li>The beef is super tender and the curry is absolutely amazing!</li><li>Pannang Curry- I liked this dish best. very tasty! the beef was cooked well and very very tender.</li><li>The beef in the beef salad was average, although the salad itself did taste a little awkward because of the pairings of raw thai basil, cilantro and mint ( hard to pickup with a fork too).</li><li>For our meal, we had the crispy beef, shrimp pad thai, and rice with panang curry- all very good.</li><li>The beef was cooked well and could have fall apart with a fork if you really wanted it too.</li><li>The crispy batter on the beef maybe could have been thinner, but I did n't mind that too much.</li><li>My fourth coworker got the golden curry with crispy beef.</li><li>The beef fell apart it was so nice and soft.</li><li>We had the Crispy Beef Panang Curry ( which tasted like not nothing we have tried before-crispy outside and THE softest beef EVER) and the Chicken Royal Pad Thai which was a bit sweet and really good as well.</li><li>The curry itself is amazing and not too spicy and the beef is tender on the inside and has a light crispy outside. i ca n't get myself to try any of the other mains! for apps i 've tried their mango salad ( note that there 's coriander in it, which I hate and mint leaves which I also do n't like), beef satay ( not bad), and their fried calamari ( I would get this again and loved the honey chili dipping sauce it came with). desserts I 've tried their mango sticky rice ( the mango was not sweet and really hard) and their deep fried banana with honey ( just standard). the decor here is super cool and there 's a nice patio area for the summer, I love this place!</li><li>Some recipes seemed somewhat different than I remembered ( the crispy beef with golden curry was just ok but I used to love it).</li><li>The beef is so nicely cooked and the genius of it 's crispy texture goes so well with the complex sauce it bathes in.</li><li>Shrimp Panang is a Thai fried curry sauce made with coconut milk, sweet basil and lime leaf, usually topped off with bell peppers, peanuts and chicken, beef or shrimp.</li><li>Their saving grace is the crispy beef.</li><li>Panang curry with crispy beef- while the curry was creamy and went well with the rice, the beef was lacking any texture and again the breading was too thick.</li><li>My favourite part was the beef itself, which was tender, juicy and battered- and the light batter coating made for a nice crunch.</li><li>We got the beef in the Chili sauce which I did not like.</li><li>The rare beef was quite raw, but cooks in seconds in the hot soup.</li><li>The beef was so fat that even tasted like pork.</li><li>Rare beef and tendon pho, it was a pretty decent broth considering its a Chinese viet restaurant.</li><li>Every Lamb and Beef dish on this picture friendly menu is AWESOME. go in for a warm lamb stew or chef 's special soup in the winter, or cool garlic cucumbers in the summer. their beef or lamb chinese style pancakes are YUM -- delightfully puffy and filled with perfectly seasoned meat. their house special beef noodle soup is cravable! you can taste the time and love in the soup base. ughh so goooood .. and the hand pulled noodles are as real as they get outside of la chine. seriously ? who cooks like this anymore outside of china ? -- these are classic techniques! the decor is kind of hilarious though, a lil step up from a hole in the wall, it 's definitely clean, but it also feels like you 're in the middle of nowhere china, really really first gen. like you 've escaped the city. and nothing matches. the walls are cheerily painted like you 're walking into the plateaus deep into china, starkly contrasting the leather booths and the crazy yellow seat covers that match the trilingual waitress 's outfits ( they mainly speak mandarin, some canto, and english). the TVs are always playing old 50 's chinese black &amp; white talkies, and there are neon signs boasting great halel food! the chef is usually out and about greeting the customers- he 's won awards for his food, and i agree -- this place is seriously the best regional lamb and beef dishes that 's hit the east side of this city since ... johnny 's burgers. i highly recommend this place! because i 'd be so sad to see it go under because no one knows about it. deserves my YUM YUM approval fo sheezie;).</li><li>Beef or Lamb pancakes- can be oily but the bun has a nice texture.</li><li>The BBQ menu was excellent bbq lamb, chicken and beef.</li><li>Hand Made Beef Noodle Soup ( $ 5.99) was quite savory, the noodle cooked al dente with a good bite.</li><li>My friend said the food is actually classified as Islamic, so all the dishes are lamb or beef.</li><li>Everything I 've tried at this restaurant was fairly good; I 've had lamb skewers, both the beef and lamb in a sliced bun, and lamb and beef ramen.</li><li>The beef was tender with sweet and garlic flavours which gave the dish a nice balance.</li><li>We especially loved the whole garlic cloves that were cooked with the beef.</li><li>We ordered bean sprouts, hand made beef noodle soup, spicy beef lung, sizzling beef and veggies as well as lamb skewers.</li><li>Friend and I ordered beef fried rice, chicken teriyaki, beef, chicken and avocado with spinach sushi.</li><li>The menu consists of shawarmas ( Lamb, chicken, beef), falafel, kebabs ( beef or chicken) in a pita or as a platter with salad, hummus, garlic sauce and rice or fries for the meat options.</li><li>The menu consists of shawarmas ( Lamb, chicken, beef), falafel, kebabs ( beef or chicken) in a pita or as a platter with salad, hummus, garlic sauce and rice or fries for the meat options.</li><li>If in your plate, the beef, the rice and the salad is not good then I really do n't know what to rate this place as.</li><li>Over the years I 've had most things but my fave is the veggie combo with either chicken or beef.</li><li>The downside was caused by an underseasoned rice side and the lack of flavours in the beef it self.</li><li>All the meats, lamb, beef, chicken are very flavourful and tender.</li><li>They have the mandatory required tripe, tendon and brisket with rare beef.</li><li>I ordered rare beef and beef balls pho.</li><li>The pho was so little, beef was quite tough and chewy, the tripe was good.</li><li>Tried the Beef curry first; the beef was tender but very dry.</li><li>Yeung chow fried rice, spicy salt and pepper squid, beef and dough fritter rice noodle roll and general tao chicken was what we ordered.</li><li>Firstly, we had beef and chicken dishes, both `` felt'' like they had been treated with a meat tenderizer.</li><li>Beef, Ginger and Green Onion- Beef was that gelatinous kind that was probably cooked a decade ago and then frozen.</li><li>Beef, Ginger and Green Onion- Beef was that gelatinous kind that was probably cooked a decade ago and then frozen.</li><li>Pho: beef is surprisingly tender!</li><li>Cantonese chow mein, turnip patties, fried squid, house congee, general tao 's chicken, snow pea leaf, gai lan/Chinese broccoli, beef and broccoli, roast pork, BBQ duck, fish maw soup, hot and sour soup, soft-shell crab fried rice, eel fried rice ...</li><li>Also, their Singaporean Vermacelli, their Yeung Chow Fried Rice, their beef Ho Phun .... well, any of their noodles and fried rice are awesome. oh, but do n't try their Thai dishes ..... it 's not their forte.</li><li>And my friend stir fry noodle with beef was even worse.</li><li>The beef is tender no texture and taste like cardboard.</li><li>Great place for late night eats, special congee is loaded with shrimp and beef balls. gota try the turnip cake.</li><li>Very very disappointed I have to say, the food was not fresh, the beef was almost a blackish color and tasted sour, when I pointed out to the waitrese and the manager, they said that 's the way it should be.</li><li>They have pork, beef, chicken, short ribs, and pork belly marinated in Korean BBQ Marinade.</li><li>The beef and short ribs were easily the best part of the meal.</li><li>I ordered the beef and seafood table stirring.</li><li>It 's required that you order two portions and you ca n't mix and match ( ex: 1 order of chicken 1 order of beef), but it 's ok !!</li><li>The menu items and the quality of their beef.</li><li>Sadly, the beef here is n't the best ( even for AYCE).</li><li>The beef was really good- along with the dipping sauces.</li><li>We ordered the lamb, beef, taro, udon noodles, napa cabbage, shrimp ( with shell), tofu, and some other stuff.</li><li>I would suggest to always go for their special rolls, my ranking of my favorite rolls over there:- Rainbow- Moon River- Hard Rock- Beef- Spider.</li><li>The soup base and noodle are good but the meat itself is too dry, especially the beef.</li><li>Tomato + egg + beef is the main ingredient.</li><li>The beef and pork were chopped and cubed, and tasted average.</li><li>On our visit, we ordered a Biang-Biang Mian ( hand-slapped and pulled ribbon noodles, stewed beef, sauteed tomato fried egg, and mixed vegetables) and a Lamb Pao Mo ( lamb stew, bean sprout, organic cloud ear mushroom, tomato, ground garlic, ginger and scallion with hand pulled noodles stir fried in wok, finished with house special marinara sauce) plus wood ear mushroom to share.</li><li>The beef is stewed so well, not tough at all.</li><li>The beef was juicy and the serving was pretty hefty.</li><li>They used pretty good cuts of beef.</li><li>I love their hand cut noodles soaked in soy braised beef soup with chunks of tender flavorful beef.</li><li>After having drank a spoonful of broth we resorted to just eating the noodles and the beef ( without drinking the broth) but because of how salty the broth was, they just tasted like salty noodles and salty beef.</li><li>After having drank a spoonful of broth we resorted to just eating the noodles and the beef ( without drinking the broth) but because of how salty the broth was, they just tasted like salty noodles and salty beef.</li><li>Lots of delish beef.</li><li>To top it off, there was so much white pepper in the soup and our slices of beef was dry and bland.</li><li>I like the scallop and melon in there! 3. beef and onion roll: surprisingly tasty, which was above my expectations.</li><li>Stir Fried Ho Fun with Beef.</li><li>I personally really like the beef and green onion roll.</li><li>We ordered several plates of dumplings, sadly most of them were pork ( my cousin ordered not realizing that my sister does n't eat pork or beef).</li><li>I like the beef and broccoli as well as the fried rice with shrimp and eggs.</li><li>It was really delicious when the beef was stuffed inside the bread.</li><li>Both were disappointing, especially the beef.</li><li>We complement our meal with Hot and Sour soup, dumplings, fried rice, and the crispy beef.</li><li>Then, we had an assortment of dishes including fried pork cutlets, fried green beans, tofu, beef and onion, Chicken with sprinkled garlic and for me, vegetarian dumplings ( but no meat).</li><li>Because of the small portion, we ordered another dish- sizzling beef.</li><li>As a result, the beef was drowning in water and it tasted really bland.</li><li>The barbecue sauce was the right amount of sweetness to accompany the thin slices of beef.</li><li>The beef was braised nicely, the meat was tenderly split apart and not tough at all.</li><li>In my bibimbap I only got 3 pieces of beef ...</li><li>The beef was top quality and you can tell by how marbleized the meat was with fat.</li><li>My only qualm was that the beef was a bit low quality and had some tough, sinewy pieces in it.</li><li>A spicy beef, fried rice with pork in an clay pot ?</li><li>The beef and lamb combo was pretty tasty with a little kick of spice but not too hot.</li><li>Most recommended dish will be obviously their pho dac biet ( special famous beef noodle soup) with all the works including thinly sliced beef, beef balls, beef shank, beef tendon ( mmm my favourite!) and noodle with lots of bean sprouts and mint.</li><li>I took the package to work and opened up the styrofoam container to find it brimming with shredded cabbage, some other stringed vegetable, herbs, bean sprouts, noodles, beef and some sort of ham.</li><li>We ordered- bun bo hue- special pho- beef and beef ball pho- rice- cha gio- three cafe su da The food was definitely a disappointment.</li><li>The broth tastes delicious and they have a generous serving of beef.</li><li>The grilled beef is passable although, I find that they do n't cut the beef into small enough pieces.</li><li>Order 205 is one of my favourites which includes beef balls and think slices of cooked beef!</li><li>The beef in the soup was n't right.</li><li>The beef and pork meat were so dry/tough/stale and not tasty.</li><li>Ordered #3 with beef, pork, tofu spicy kimchi.</li><li>Ordered the Combination Soon Tofu ( Beef, shrimp, mussels) with medium spicy.</li><li>I had the combination soon tofu, while my girlfriend had the Bulgogi Soup ( beef), and we were impressed!</li><li>The soup starts off with a refreshing beef taste and then the taste slowly deteriorated.</li><li>Combination Soon Tofu + Dolsotbab ( Beef, Shrimp, Mussel, $ 7.08) had a great broth as the base and what else took it over and above Tofu Village was that the Beef was not sniff-able sized but were edible bites and more pieces than Tofu Village.</li><li>Combination Soon Tofu + Dolsotbab ( Beef, Shrimp, Mussel, $ 7.08) had a great broth as the base and what else took it over and above Tofu Village was that the Beef was not sniff-able sized but were edible bites and more pieces than Tofu Village.</li><li>Good comfort food- they mainly serve Korean tofu soup, comes with either seafood, dumplings, beef etc.</li><li>On top of mussels, beef, tofu, and other goodies, the combination comes with an egg that you crack and get to watch cook in your soup ( and eat it too)!</li><li>Nonetheless, I was willing to try something different so I ordered Kimchi Soon Tofu + Dolsotbab ( kimchi, beef, pork).</li><li>My dining companions ordered a similar dis but with beef, shrimp, and mussels.</li><li>I chose to try the Combination Soon Tofu ( Shrimp, Mussels, Beef), while my friend decided to try the Dumpling Soon Tofu.</li><li>The kimchi tofu was awesome with the mix of beef, pork and kimchi and I got it regular spicy which had just enough kick.</li><li>The beef was good as usual marinated to perfection as my little ones gobbled it up quickly.</li><li>There are only a few menu 's here, beef, mixed, seafood, bean paste ' soon tofu', comes with stone bowl rice and ' noo roong ji' afterwards. bi bim bap, bul gogi and some others which most of them are pretty good.</li><li>I had the BBQ beef with rice, and I personally thought the beef was too sweet, but some folk might like it that way.</li><li>My mainstay is the Kimchi Soon Tofu but hold the beef, ' cause I do mine veggie style!</li><li>I usually get number #4 which is soon tofu with beef and dumplings with mild spice.</li><li>Food: Bulgogi BBQ plate- beef was over cooked and many pieces were burnt.</li><li>Cheap thin slices of beef were used compared to other Korean restaurants.</li><li>The soon tofu is served with your choice of beef, seafood, or dumplings, and comes with a bowl of purple rice in a stone bowl.</li><li>#8 on the menu was the beef was extremely sweet.</li><li>I do n't like sweet food, it had beef and glass noodles and my mouth was burning because it was so sweet.</li><li>If you are not a big fan of hot soup, that 's okay because their bi bim bap ( rice w/ veggies, egg, beef, mix w/ Korean hot sauce served in hot stone bowl) and bul go gi ( marinated beef on sizzling plate) is amazing too.</li><li>Also, the combination tofu is described as having beef, shrimp and mussel ( sic) and as we joked, they were very accurate in their

chicken, beef, pulled pork, pulled beef, fish and shrimp) and toppings ( four salsas, cheese, beans, sour cream, lettuce).</li><li>Then you pick your meat ( chicken, beef, pulled pork, pulled beef, fish and shrimp) and toppings ( four salsas, cheese, beans, sour cream, lettuce).</li><li>All three were good, but the beef was my least favourite.</li><li>I was here last night for the first time ever and my overall experience was OK .. my boyfriend had been here before so i assumed it was n't a bad place to eat. he had bulgogi ( korean beef) with rice, and i had gom tang/ gomguk ( like assorted beef soup with rice) i was not impressed with my gom tang, it hardly had any taste to it. literally it tasted like water, not that water has any taste- but that 's my point; it tasted like nothing!</li><li>I had a large rare beef and tripe pho, and an order of fresh roll pho broth: good flavour and not too greasy portion: good amount of noodle, could have used more beef and tripe for large size bowl.</li><li>I had a large rare beef and tripe pho, and an order of fresh roll pho broth: good flavour and not too greasy portion: good amount of noodle, could have used more beef and tripe for large size bowl.</li><li>We had pho with rare beef ( medium), a viet pork sandwich, and cold rolls ( p2, vb1, a2).</li><li>Pho was very good, beef was pink when it came out.</li><li>Family favourites:- Soup Filled Dumplings ( $ 5.99): ah XLB ... while I would n't say it 's the best that you can get in the city, it is way above average- Steamed Chicken Dumplings ( $ 5.99): juicy and plump- Rolled Onion Pancake with Sliced Beef ( $ 5.99): portions have been shrinking over the years, but it 's a great way to have your sliced beef and green onion pancake all at once- Deep Fried Tofu with Garlic Sauce ( $ 3.99): actually ordered this by accident once, but what a great mistake.</li><li>I would stay away from the Westernized dishes ( e.g. beef w/ broccoli, sweat &amp; sour pork, etc.) as I have n't found them to be any good.</li><li>The soup was mildly spicy and the beef was perfect.</li><li>Less beef and smaller pancake ?</li><li>Actually the wonton and fish ball is good, but not for the beef.</li><li>The wontons are a good size and the beef is really tender.</li><li>The beef there was definitely on the lower end and the fish balls had bones in it.</li><li>The beef had very little taste, and needed to douse it in hot sauce- Pork cutlet bibimbap had a generous portion of meat.</li><li>I 've often brought friends and suggested they order some meat katsu, bulgogi, kan poong ki ( sweet &amp; spicy chicken) or bi bim bap ( veggies, rice, beef, fried egg, &amp; spicy sauce).</li><li>My friends ordered beef in a stone bowl, some fried fish and pork bone soup.</li><li>They only have beef ...</li><li>Beef is soft.</li><li>Also had the beef which was good.</li><li>The protein ( chicken, lamb, beef) are 4-star restaurant quality.</li><li>Excellent quality meat kabobs such as chicken, veal, beef.</li><li>My friend had the crispy beef special and it tasted a bit sweet and the pieces of beef were a bit tough.</li><li>The spicy beef and the green curry are good.</li><li>We went in a large group and a lot of us ordered the beef.</li><li>I selected the trio of snails, beef and chocolate from the table d' hote.</li><li>Food- i ordered the make-your-own noodles with beef broth, beef short ribs and bokchoy.</li><li>The prime filet of beef was good, high quality beef.</li><li>Teppan Combination ( Sunday special) This consists of a platter of prime beef, scallops, and chicken.</li><li>The beef, although I had asked for medium rare, was too overcooked that day ( to medium) and therefore, ruined the experience a bit for me.</li><li>Chef was a little low key for Teppanyaki ( which was ok in my mind), there was several types of beef, sushi grade fish etc ...</li><li>One guest ordered Salmon, the rest ordered beef.</li><li>Salad, Soup Teppanyaki main plate that consists of Chicken, Beef, Scallops, Zucchini, Onions and mushrooms with a single scoop of ice cream to finish the dinner.</li><li>Three types of beef.</li><li>The beef was good and cooked liked I aske.</li><li>Some items are more expensive than they should be ( this is definitely the case for the beef, which was just a frozen pile of cheap beef slices).</li><li>Some items are more expensive than they should be ( this is definitely the case for the beef, which was just a frozen pile of cheap beef slices).</li><li>My last recommendation is definitely a crowd pleaser- sizzling chicken ( or beef) which comes in small and large.</li><li>Now I suspect that it was intended for us to cook our OWN meal however, I do believe one of our dinner companions ( you know who you are!) actually guilted the owner into cooking it for us!;) The beef was seasoned nicely and cooked perfectly with onion, garlic, carrots and mushrooms.</li><li>The beef was juicy and it was actually really medium rare.</li><li>We are in Canada, they should be using dry aged Prime Canadian beef.</li><li>Higher quality beef ( did n't think it could be done) and they 've added some more appetizer and main course options.</li><li>We irdered a mix of table and a la carte Table cooking Fresh beef ( looks and price loke wagu) $ 31 very small portion and not work the price Short ribs good but pricey at $ 30 Special Sliced pork belly $ 20 very good but I usually order the regular pork $ 17 ( best bet) A la carte Ka ja tang solid Bi bum bap good The side are a little better then the other korean place around and found the Noodle side dish with seasame oil excellent but they do offer free refill on that dish.</li><li>If you have time and some cheddar to spend, then I insist on getting their beef short ribs in unique sauce.</li><li>Pick your meat ( pork, lamb, beef, chicken or several different kinds of seafood), veggies ( plenty of options), noodles ( 3 varieties) and sauce ( large selection of pre-mixed or create your own) and hand your bowl to the cook who has it ready for you in a minute or so after tossing it around on a huge hot plate with no oil, just water.</li><li>The novelty with the Mongolian Grill is that you are presented with a wide variety of raw meats ( beef, pork, chicken, and lamb) and vegetables, some seafoods ( shrimps, fake crab and squid rings), noodles ( egg, rice, udon, etc.) and a stupefying selection of soupy sauces ( spicy, curry, honey garlic ... more than 10 in total) and condiment sauces ( ginger, garlic, oyster ... more than 20 in total).</li><li>Shrimp, chicken, beef, tofu, you name it- they can grill it.</li><li>Then you get in this line where you pick your meat ( choice of lamb, beef, chicken or pork), then you pick your vegetables, then noodles then whatever sauce you want.</li><li>Then there is the MONGOLIAN BBQ part- starting with proteins, you get a choice of chicken, lamb, beef, shrimp, calamari, tofu- there is lots to choose from for everybody.</li><li>The congee is one of the most flavorful I 've had and the beef in the noodle dish is very tender with the noodle having that smokey pan-fried flavor.</li><li>However, I do appreciate that their food is not too oily or salty!- other pros: LARGE portions, large variety of congee and noodles, friendly staff- con: can become very crowded: ( side dishes I 've tried and liked: tofu and garoupa, house special chicken, mushroom and beef, tofu and mixed veggie congees I 've tried and liked: mixed vegetable and sweetcorn, sweetcorn and beancurd. congees I 've tried and disliked: sliced fish congee tastes bland ....</li><li>Tender beef and fresh mince green peppers &amp; yummy sauteed soup, little bit 2 greasy though.</li><li>Find something else. went there with a friend for lunch, it was buffet. the place was quite small but with a lot of places to sit! they have large tables too! the service was great, fast and friendly people. the buffet include: one soup 2 or 3 salad options many dips and sauces 1 rice 3-4 kind of vegetable dishes 5-6 meat dishes ( include chicken, lamb, beef, shrimps) they also have bread ( nan) and appetizers ( could not remember the names) they also have desserts ( 2 kinds) and fruits the taste was very good and not too spicy, however they have really extreme spicy sauces! the price was around 10 dollars as a neighborhood restaurant it one of the best options in the area and for sure I 'll be back:).</li><li>The menu is quite extensive and offers all kinds of meats like Chicken, Beef, Lamb and even seafood platters.</li><li>Yes it 's a bowl of soup, but it is n't no frills though- it comes with fresh seaweed, a slice of turnip, half an egg, and few pieces beef.</li><li>Aroma- breathe in the salt and seaweed, you can readily exfoliate your face with the steam.:) Taste- noodles cooked with the right amount of chewiness, it soaks the flavours of the soup base nicely, beef was ample, it was very tender in the soup, the half egg cooked about right and not over done.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
