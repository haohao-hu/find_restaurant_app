<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 27' %><h2>Noodles<br />occurrence: 276</h2><div><ol><li>I went today to get the Noodles and beef special.</li><li>The noodles were stale, like they sat there for days, the meat was tough.</li><li>This is in direct contrast with the amazing Singapore noodles, Kung Pow chicken, Pad Thai and other various Szechuan dishes I absolutely loved last time.</li><li>Liked the noodles and beef dish ( not from the dim sum menu).</li><li>I got stir fry noodles and pan fried onion cake, the noodles were super oily and did n't have much taste and the pan fried onion cake was burnt.</li><li>The noodles and rice were cooked to perfection.</li><li>I ordered the black bean noodles and my boyfriend ordered the handmade noodles.</li><li>The handmade noodles were bland and had a horrible smell to it.</li><li>When I compared the supposedly `` handmade'' noodles to the black bean noodle dish, the noodles in both dishes were the same- not handmade at all.</li><li>When I compared the supposedly `` handmade'' noodles to the black bean noodle dish, the noodles in both dishes were the same- not handmade at all.</li><li>- Spicy Seafood with Tofu Soup- Grilled Marinated Beef with Rice in Hot Pot- Cold Noodles in Hot Sauce The banchan has so much varieties.</li><li>I though find the Cold Noodles are not as spicy as the other I have ... but it is better like that then having it drain in hot sauce!</li><li>The Noodles is still AMAZING but the Dumpling this time did n't go as well.</li><li>The noodles are nice and chewy with a lot of bite!</li><li>My suggestion comes for the noodles in beef broth and skip the dumplings if you cannot stand the garlic!: P** YELP ALERT** Man Doo Hyang is under new ownership/management.</li><li>Noodles were okay.</li><li>There 's mushrooms, vegetables, 6 dumplings, rice cakes, handmade noodles and some pork.</li><li>You get some of those delicious dumplings, and thick yummy noodles, rice cakes ( tip: wait to eat them at the end so that they 've soaked up all that flavourful broth), mushrooms, veggies ...</li><li>I usually order the combo specials ( $ 6.99ish depending on whether you want rice or noodles and such) which included a bubble tea and a small dessert.</li><li>They were also very nice and substituted rice for the noodles it was supposed to come with, thereby accommodating my non gluten, non dairy diet.</li><li>I would try this place again but I do not recommend the noodles here, I do not feel it is their speciality.</li><li>The noodles was good ...</li><li>Other `` toppings'' include: Sweet and Sour Pork Beef in Black Bean Sauce Chicken in Black Bean Sauce Mixed Vegetables Curry Chicken Fried Chicken Wings Fried Pork Chops Ma Po Bean Curd ( boiled tofu) Fried Bean Curd ( fried tofu) Spicy Vermicelli Noodle ( curry flavoured)*** Shanghai Fried Noodles*** Honey Garlic Pork Ribs Barbecued Chicken Chicken Balls Spring Rolls Egg Rolls*** = These noodles can be used as a base instead.</li><li>Considering most places raise their prices every 8-12 months, I 'm impressed! 3) My biggest complaint with most Chinese food places is that you have to order each dish separately, so if a group of people want fried rice, noodles, and a few different meats, they 'd have to order about $ 40 worth of dishes and then divide it up themselves.</li><li>You can choose from your sashimi, maki rolls, tempura, cooked items, rice, noodles etc.</li><li>They used instant noodles ( which is fine, just advertise it as such) and the egg that accompanied the dish was fried rather than boiled ...</li><li>The menu does n't have an extensive selection of meals as other Viet restaurants but they do have the basics of spring rolls, pho ( beef and chicken), pho beef stew, rice and noodles.</li><li>Their service was prompt, food was fresh- including the noodles, which is pretty hard to come by these days when you compare the price units on OrientK 's menu in the delivery side of the restaurant business in its neighbourhood.</li><li>She got a new set of utensils and broke the chicken into pieces, and mixed it with the soup, rice and noodles.</li><li>Noodles were n't crunchy at all, but rather soggy.</li><li>We ordered noodles, house fried rice, ginger and onion shrimp, crispy ginger chicken and the green beans.</li><li>I would have skipped the noodles, they were too saucy and did n't have much to offer.</li><li>Ordered the beef ho fun ( noodles were okay but i think they lightly battered and deep fried the beef before smothering it in black bean sauce).</li><li>Singapore noodles were bland and tasteless.</li><li>( I fought my urge to get the crispy noodles because not many people makes those, but they are usually much better for an eat in dinner, next time, next time) All in all a great experience, probably better if we shared this meal with more than 3 people because we have enough to serve another 3 in the fridge, all under 42 $!</li><li>To start the mango salad was n't thai at all ... hello is green mango not sweet! and where are the nuts and the onions ?? and the greens were all soggy and old ... then the soup it did not look like the picture in the menu and was super sweet ( i asked if it suppose to be that sweet, and she answer `` yes they put lots of sugar'') ... finally the noodles were swimming in sauce, in which i could not find the nuts and was super salty !!! ...</li><li>If you want something different than your usual burgers and fries, or tasteless noodles, give this a try!</li><li>The noodles was really good, refreshing and chewy at the same time!</li><li>I ordered the 12-piece Sashimi lunch special for an incredible $ 10.99; it came with a side of rice, noodles, two dumplings and the usual miso soup and salad.</li><li>Therefore, my rating is based on the overcooked noodles and beef that is n't raw when served.</li><li>Noodles were quite good but were thick rice noodles and not vermicelli as listed.</li><li>Their pho is ok, lots of noodles, meat is fresh but sliced very thinly.</li><li>The noodles are plain and do n't have the kind of bounce you 'd expect from pho.</li><li>The more you chew the noodles, the more it tastes like plastic.</li><li>The noodles were n't as al dente as I had hoped, but they did n't exactly disappointed.</li><li>Usually I am happy to please at a Northern Chinese Restaurants, just give me noodles, dumplings and something hot and spicy, I will be a happy camper.</li><li>The fish and flower tofu in chile oil is another personal favourite and their dandan noodles and yi bing oiled noodles are the best in the city.</li><li>So, I came here with my dad for dinner and we ordered: Spicy beef noodle soup- Big enough for 2 to share,- generous amount of beef, but was not very tender- soup base was not spicy and needs to be more concentrated- noodles tasted plain, but pretty chewy Spicy lettuce- crunchy and juicy- absolutely drowned in chili oil ( which made it more spicy than the noodle soup)- presentation was very unappealing Sweet and sour chicken- this plate screamed MSG with its neon orange colour- suprisingly there was a lot of chicken meat instead of flour Overall: Like I said ...</li><li>The noodles are overcooked and the sauce is subpar, but it satisfies the hunger when you are studying.</li><li>The soup is delicious, noodles are well timed, beef is tasty.</li><li>The noodles were nicely done ( not too mushy or too dry) and the flavour was tangy and sweet.</li><li>Soup was slightly salty, but we devoured the noodles ( cooked perfectly), the soft, luscious chicken and other vegetables.</li><li>The noodles have excellent consistency, a good ratio to the broth and are perfectly cooked.</li><li>That 's rare beef, tripe, tendons, beef balls plus the noodles and broth for $ 6.50.</li><li>They could of given us more sauce though, the noodles seemed barely coated in it.</li><li>So it 's a great place to grab a bite after shopping all the outlet stores on Orfus Rd. I had the Combo D, which was Spicy Crispy Chicken, stir-fried noodles and vegetables all for $ 6.95.</li><li>The noodles too were not oily/greasy like at most Chinese restaurants.</li><li>We ordered the Kashk Bademjam ( puree of golden fried eggplant with onion whey and mint), Persian soup ( veggies, noodles, pinto beans, whey, sauteed garlic and mint), and Koobideh ( charbroiled, seasoned ground beef) Kebab with rice.</li><li>My favourite is the `` Asheh Reshteh'' which is a thick Persian Soup with beans, noodles, greens and s topped with whey and fried onions.</li><li>We had these asian type noodles .... sooooo good !!!</li><li>We asked that they separate the sauce from the noodles so the noodles would be crispier.</li><li>The noodles were crispy on both sides, and only the sides, leaving the majority of the noodles on the inside not crispy.</li><li>The noodles were a combination of egg noodles and vermicelli, that included a `` sahog'' of various meat including chicken, shrimp, bits of lechon kawali, and some veggies.</li><li>The noodles are half big egg noodles ( I have no idea what they 're called but they 're udon like) and half vermicelli.</li><li>It 's laid back enough that it does n't feel like a crime to put your elbows on the table and slurp up your noodles.</li><li>The broth was good, the noodles seemed fresh, meat portion was decent. good sign What lacked was the portion sizes were smaller than the typical Pho restaurant and side dishes.</li><li>A large is a satisfying serving of meats, tendon and noodles.</li><li>Noodles: Fine and pretty standard, well cooked, but they put less of them per bowl than other places I have been to.</li><li>The vermicelli also has the perfect balance between the noodles, lettuce, pickled cucumber and carrot.</li><li>The broth is excellent, the noodles are not bad, pretty consistent, never undercooked or overcooked.</li><li>Pho with rare beef and beef balls- Noodles was decent, but standard.</li><li>You get to eat the chicken first, followed by thick and chewy noodles, and finished off with congee.</li><li>The ginseng chicken, the noodles and the congee in the end.</li><li>The noodles, tempura ( veggies only, the shrimp was meh), beef and rock shrimp were the highlights.</li><li>Individual portions of noodles, soups and chicken teriyaki.</li><li>There is a lot of it, but I find that the noodles are pretty greasy and do n't have too much flavor to it.</li><li>Noodles were less than average as they were still hard and stuck together by the end of our meal.</li><li>She said the noodles tasted sour like it was from an old batch or something.</li><li>My bf enjoyed the rare beef ball pho however said the noodles could have been better.</li><li>Appetizer Debriziners, Langos, the cucumber salad, paprikas, schnitzel, the noodles.</li><li>Some of the staples are the congee, the noodles and rice and usually a side order.</li><li>I liked that it was hot ( yes, I know I said it already), noodles were a little dry but the sweetness of the preserves cabbage saved it a little bit- place was clean, service was fast ( I went around 5:30-6)- probably it was midtown, prices were jacked up 1-2 dollars compared to uptown.- overall, you 're going to a diner and this place delivered what a Chinese diner needs to be.</li><li>The noodles were also pretty boring overall.</li><li>The noodles were all broken up.</li><li>If I say it 's not spicy ... it 's really not spicy* I did n't like the mozarella cheese, it had weird texture and it took away the spiciness of the dish* Instant noodles were good after it soaked up all the sauce* When you are 80% done, ask for your rice to be cooked and they will do it for you* I love the crispy bottom part of the rice Summary: I would go back to Joons, but would order things differently.</li><li>It 's $ 13.95 per portion and we added cheese and noodles.</li><li>And the noodles were chewy yes yes!</li><li>We had the fried glass noodles, pineapple fried rice and curry beef panang.</li><li>The noodles were chewy as opposed to soggy and it was just sweet enough.</li><li>The menu is small and offers your typical curries and noodles amongst other dishes.</li><li>Both noodles were 10/10 !! ...</li><li>Noodles were cooked perfectly, the beef shanks were flavorful, I was blown away.</li><li>I was hoping that I can get the noodles at a store, but the lady told me they made everything in the kitchen themselves ..</li><li>The noodles also arrived with a pair of scissors to cut up the noodles.</li><li>The noodles also arrived with a pair of scissors to cut up the noodles.</li><li>Broth was ok, noodles well prepared.</li><li>The octopus and squid were good and the noodles were never ending and were really the thing that was making me full.</li><li>My coworkers ordered the mango salad ( a little mealy and sweet, not spicy at all) and the Shanghai noodles, which were actually these clear, broad, tangly noodles that I 've never seen before.</li><li>The noodles were fresh and springy to the bite, with a lightly spiced sauce.</li><li>The noodles were neither over cooked, nor it was soggy.</li><li>Regardless, the noodles tasted great, but I found the chicken a bit dry and hard to chew.</li><li>The Taro dumplings and khannom jeen noodles was my favourite dish.</li><li>It was an interesting texture and the noodles were flavourful.</li><li>I love the Siam noodles and was really looking forward to that.</li><li>Islamic noodles were good but I would have preferred more sauce!</li><li>I thought they were generous with their meat and their small was more than enough for me, almost did n't finish the noodles.</li><li>Their noodles are freshly made and by hand.</li><li>The portion size for the noodles was a bit small but it was the perfect amount for just the two of us.</li><li>The noodles were good, however thick.</li><li>Beef soup noodle was quite good, the noodles were quite delicious ..</li><li>Delicious hand made noodles were nice and chewy.</li><li>The noodles was delicious.</li><li>Although the usual noodles, rice costs as much as other ball places, the meat dishes are a pretty penny.</li><li>The noodles was great and we ordered dumplings and more noodles.</li><li>Noodles are also well done here, very authentic and well priced.</li><li>Decor, space, and service were all amazing BUT the food was n't ( mind you this is dependent if you fancy Mongolian cuisine) I surprisingly found the curry fish to taste scrumptious but other items such as friend potato and noodles to be bland and in some cases very oily I would recommend this for someone craving traditional Chinese cuisine but if you are like me who enjoy Hakka style more I would avoid this place.</li><li>They used strong chicken stock instead of the classic shoyu, ruining the soup, the noodles were undercooked, and my mom was saying `` no, it 's fine I can just eat it'' but then had to stop halfway through.</li><li>I tried dipping the noodles and beef into the soup but it was still meh.</li><li>Congee and noodles is always good.</li><li>The congee is well seasoned and the noodles are never too greasy.</li><li>The noodles were crunchy and well dressed!</li><li>My friend had a noodle dish w/crab that was nothing but flavorless noodles and nearly no crab.</li><li>The Cantoneese noodles were excellent and not greasy which is often the case.</li><li>The dishes are really standard vegetable, rice, noodles, and congee with a different spin so avoid ordering two similar dishes or you may find them tasting similar.</li><li>Pumpkin congee hot pot with crab and glass noodles.</li><li>Also, their Singaporean Vermacelli, their Yeung Chow Fried Rice, their beef Ho Phun .... well, any of their noodles and fried rice are awesome. oh, but do n't try their Thai dishes ..... it 's not their forte.</li><li>Lots of choices from Congee, to main dishes, noodles, snacks almost anything Cantonese ( they have pho and pad thai too!) that you can think of.</li><li>Though the noodles did n't absorb the broth too well and tasted pretty bland.</li><li>So ... my verdict on these noodles were a mixture of good and bad.</li><li>I enjoyed the noodles, they were not soggy but very tender however, the pork ...</li><li>I feel like these noodles vary ( not in a bad way) from visit to visit, but they were good this time.</li><li>You have to pay $ 2.00 extra for each topping you want added ( ie. rice cake, mozzarella cheese, rice, noodles).</li><li>I usually order the daegalbee with noodles, cheese, and rice cakes.</li><li>The dish is predominantly Instant Noodles and rice cakes.</li><li>If the instant noodles is the main, then $ 11 is a rip off.</li><li>Also, we had noodles added as well with a moderate amount of spice.</li><li>I personally think that the noodles are a bit overrated and quite overpriced when you consider the add-ons.</li><li>The waitresses helped mix the chicken with the cheese and noodles, however she had to bring the cooking table away from us as our table was too small.</li><li>The best way to enjoy this dish: make sure you add on rice cakes, cheese and instant noodles.</li><li>The rice cakes are deliciously chewy, and the instant noodles help soak up all the extra sauce ( made the mistake of not getting noodles the first time, and it was just way too saucy and salty.)</li><li>Whenever I go I add the cheese, rice cakes and noodles.</li><li>We added noodles, cheese and rice cakes and it was yummy:) The spice is perfect, enough to clear your sinuses, but not sweat profusely from the heat: p The downside I can think of is that service is a bit slow and the add ons ( rice cakes, noodles, cheese, rice etc) are extra.</li><li>We ordered DakGalBee hot pot as our base and we also ordered cheese, noodles, etc with it by adding a few dollars.</li><li>Came here for lunch and got the beef &amp; glass noodles, which came with a bowl of rice ( $ 8.95).</li><li>When I first visited Joons on Yonge and on Bloor St for its Dak Galbi 10 + years ago, we used to order 2 portions for 2 people with some add-ons like rice cake or instant noodles and that would be pretty filling.</li><li>I got the Original Spicy Dakgalbee and added noodles, rice cake and mozzarella.</li><li>I just fear for the servers ' safety when they cook the noodles since the equipment they use to cook the dishes look a bit archaic. i used to go to the one in downtown and this time i thought i will give their yonge location a try !! ordered the chicken dakgalbee with their original joons sauce. and always its a must to add on cheese, ramen and ricecake !!! ( MY FAVVVV !!!) it was a little different as the dakgalbee was now cooked by a staff and brought to you instead of it being cooked right in front of you !! ( there was a little area on one side of the restaurant where a staff is cooking all the dakgalbee orders). i didnt like that as i enjoyed taking part in the cooking process and watching it cooked right in front of me !! the portions did seem smaller and the ramen ended up being overcooked. everything else was ok. maybe its just me but i find the downtown location tasted better!</li><li>I like all the options! especially tons of CHEESE with instant noodles ?</li><li>The dakgalbi dishes now require you to place a minimum of 2 orders per dish, which can be quite pricey, considering the popular add ons- rice cakes, noodles and cheese, are an additional ~ $ 2 each.</li><li>I always get it with the regular level spicy ( + rice cakes, noodles and mozzarella cheese) I would recommend asking them to put less vegetables ( they always put a lot and less chicken).</li><li>The JS1 is just normal dak gal bee with chicken and vegetable where you can add on the rice cakes, cheese, noodles, sweet potato, vegetable, steamed rice and fried rice for $ 1- $ 2 each.</li><li>Texture and chewiness is what I am an seeking in the hand-pulled noodles- amazing!</li><li>This is your answer Hand made and pulled noodles with a wide variety of options to serve all tasted Pretty much every bowl is under ten bucks so not a tough decision to make However there is only seating for 14 customers so it 's a bit of a bolt hole but worth the wait to grab a seat Great service and great food My dish had wide flat noodles and had the right amount of chew to them and it 's a huge portion All ingredients were fresh and it felt odd I was the only gaijin in the place where the waitress kept trying to explain to me how to eat ..... no I know chopsticks yeah h-mart yes noodles .... hahaha Excellent and unique food, savory noodles, excellent ambiance.</li><li>This is your answer Hand made and pulled noodles with a wide variety of options to serve all tasted Pretty much every bowl is under ten bucks so not a tough decision to make However there is only seating for 14 customers so it 's a bit of a bolt hole but worth the wait to grab a seat Great service and great food My dish had wide flat noodles and had the right amount of chew to them and it 's a huge portion All ingredients were fresh and it felt odd I was the only gaijin in the place where the waitress kept trying to explain to me how to eat ..... no I know chopsticks yeah h-mart yes noodles .... hahaha Excellent and unique food, savory noodles, excellent ambiance.</li><li>The noodles were the extremely wide type, which I personally like.</li><li>Ex. we wanted to order the combo ( cold noodles, pork momo, &amp; orange soda) but they did n't have it because the momos ran out, so we just ordered the cold noodles.</li><li>By the time we got our noodles, I saw the table next to us got the combo, so I asked the server about it.</li><li>Stewed beef noodles: the noodles were chewy and so authentic!</li><li>These noodles are hand made, they are a bit thick so you will get full!</li><li>The noodles, being thick, do n't get very soggy.</li><li>Good combination of diced pork cubes, tomato, egg and the hand-pulled noodles were fantastic ....</li><li>However it was a bit greasy by my standard, and toppings were all cold while the noodles were only lukewarm.</li><li>I think it 's a good portion and it 's very flavourful, The noodles from the xi' an combo is alright, nothing too special I think.</li><li>I had a bit of her noodles, it had a chewy texture, my first time having such noodles, not bad at all.</li><li>I chose wide noodles and now I know that I 'm not a fan of wide noodles.</li><li>Excellent noodles and good amount of fish.</li><li>More after the break Pros: Noodles are pretty well made Portions are good Cons: Place is way too small Right from the get go, you will notice this place is extremely small.</li><li>There 's a guy in the kitchen constantly hand making the noodles.</li><li>Fresh noodles are always a plus.</li><li>Also, you 're crammed in with everyone, who are all having hot steaming noodles as well as a kitchen constantly making noodles.</li><li>When you take out, the noodles obviously overcook a little in the container and are no longer as delicious as they should be.</li><li>It 's flavourful though--the noodles ( I prefer the fatter noodles, as I 've tried both), are chewy and they give you a pretty good amount.</li><li>It had a great range of flavours and the texture of the noodles was great.</li><li>Delicious noodles in a snug ( veeeery snug) little noodle shop.</li><li>They use homestyle handmade noodles, which is the biggest spotlight to me.</li><li>I do n't think they pull the noodles at the restaurants so it does n't have the `` fresh'' factor but the noodles are still good! 3.5 stars.</li><li>For apps we had the xi' an liang pi noodles ( sesame version) and the pork jia mo. The sesame sauce on the noodles was light and yet rich.</li><li>For apps we had the xi' an liang pi noodles ( sesame version) and the pork jia mo.
