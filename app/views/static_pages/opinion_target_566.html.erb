( seems like those are the consistent recommendations by the staff) ...</li><li>Our chicken souvlaki was tough, dry, and burnt black in some spots.</li><li>Came here for lunch as my favourite spot ( Triple Z) was closed; I really wanted to like this place as its so close to my work and the reviews are great, sadly I wont be going back .. had the chicken souvlaki and although it was moist the flavor was bland, no zest of lemon, no zing from garlic .. tasted like something I 'd get from a hospital cafeteria ..</li><li>We had chicken souvlaki but everything my hubby tried to order they were out of.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
