lamb.</li><li>The Gyros were dry and cardboardy, the lamb had no life left in it.</li><li>Try the gyros on a pita, or lamb on a bun.</li><li>Veal, steak, seafood, lamb.</li><li>Our only issue was with the lamb skewer dish that used lamb shank as its basis and thus was hard to chew ... perhaps if they had used 2nd cut lamb it would have worked out better.</li><li>We tried the falafel appetizer, kabob ( mixture of beef and lamb), chicken tabaka ( also known as butterfly chicken), and the salmon dish.</li><li>So if you want to get lamb or chicken doner, go earlier.</li><li>The lamb was absolutely horrible; the gamey taste lingered and i strongly question the overall freshness of their produce.</li><li>Along with a single skewer of mediocre lamb and a glass of wine, I was left with a bleak outlook on this restaurant and a $ 30 bill after tips.</li><li>I ordered the gyros and my boyfriend ordered the lamb.</li><li>So far I 've had burger, fish and chips, souvlaki, lamb, seafood chowder, breakfast, wings, salad and so on and such, for which I have nothing but praises.</li><li>I got for the pork, and he gets the lamb.</li><li>I 'm not normally a fan of lamb but this was just something else.</li><li>The Lamb poutine lacks gravy ... hello where is the lamb ???</li><li>The lamb was succulent, tender and wonderfully seasoned.</li><li>I think lula kebab, rack of lamb, chicken

originally wanted to get the PAPPARDELLE with lamb ragu but the kitchen was still cooking the lamb and wo n't be ready for another hour.</li><li>You can find anything from lamb hearts to saffron ice cream sandwiches.</li><li>Pros Nice location Ambiance is good Service is fast Friendly staff Good presentation Red curry was on par Cons Dinner for two $ 74 Duck was smoked and dry, gummy Lamb was as dry as it can get.</li><li>If you 're coming here to grab a hot meal- you should be here for the Cevappi, which are a ground meat sausages made with veal, lamb and pork.</li><li>Price wise look for it to top out around $ 12 for the 10 pieces of Cevappi on a bun with the `` fixins'', one you start eating these, they are seasoned and I normally do n't like lamb, but because of the mix of meat I am unable to detect the lamb from the other meats, which can be a good thing, if you 're like me and do n't like how grassy Lamb tastes.</li><li>I ordered the lamb hand pilaf rice, they served me `` fried rice'' with soy sauce and eggs, and the lamb were same size as rice, could you believe that ?</li><li>I do n't even normally eat red meat, but they had so many lamb things on the menu, and all the scents of the food around us smelled so good, I decided this worth a compromise, and it totally was.</li><li>They make magic with lamb here!</li><li>Every Lamb and Beef dish on this picture friendly menu is AWESOME. go in for a warm lamb stew or chef 's special soup in the winter, or cool garlic cucumbers in the summer. their beef or lamb chinese style pancakes are YUM -- delightfully puffy and filled with perfectly seasoned meat. their house special beef noodle soup is cravable! you can taste the time and love in the soup base. ughh so goooood .. and the hand pulled noodles are as real as they get outside of la chine. seriously ? who cooks like this anymore outside of china ? -- these are classic techniques! the decor is kind of hilarious though, a lil step up from a hole in the wall, it 's definitely clean, but it also feels like you 're in the middle of nowhere china, really really first gen. like you 've escaped the city. and nothing matches. the walls are cheerily painted like you 're walking into the plateaus deep into china, starkly contrasting the leather booths and the crazy yellow seat covers that match the trilingual waitress 's outfits ( they mainly speak mandarin, some canto, and english). the TVs are always playing old 50 's chinese black &amp; white talkies, and there are neon signs boasting great halel food! the chef is usually out and about greeting the customers- he 's won awards for his food, and i agree -- this place is seriously the best regional lamb and beef dishes that 's hit the east side of this city since ... johnny 's burgers. i highly recommend this place! because i 'd be so sad to see it go under because no one knows about it. deserves my YUM YUM approval fo sheezie;).</li><li>I ordered the hand-made lamb noodle soup, and the lamb was just a perfect combination of fatty and meaty.</li><li>The fried lamb was a bit too tough for my taste, but still, all in all, I have n't found lamb this good on this side of the Pacific.</li><li>As a side-note, the lamb tends to be quite odorous.</li><li>Decor: the words suburban communist china come to mind, well intentioned chinese kitsch Our group ordered a host of dishes that could really be described as a lamb-a-palooza, lamb, lamb and more lamb with vegetables making a minor guest appearance.</li><li>Decor: the words suburban communist china come to mind, well

generally pretty good and if you like lamb, you should check it out.</li><li>My friend said the food is actually classified as Islamic, so all the dishes are lamb or beef.</li><li>The lamb was soft and tasty, though I would have loved it more if the skin were a bit crispier.</li><li>For $ 9 it 's a small piece of lamb and a bit too salty for my liking.</li><li>I would n't drive too far out of my way to come here, but if you 're up for a twist on your regular har gow and siu mei, and like lamb, I 'd recommend it.</li><li>This place is all about the Lamb and beef dishes, hand pulled noodles and

The lamb was very tender, the soup was very refreshing, and the Pao Mo were just the right amount of chewiness.</li><li>Cold noodle ( $ 4.99): about average taste for cold noodle and under-sized and a little pricey ( later found that for $ 2 more, the Szechuan cold noodle is much better tasting and a much bigger serving; this was on my second visit) Lamb pao-mo ( $ 9.99) ( sweet potato starch noodles): the noodles are in a small, chunky form and the lamb and soup base were decent.</li><li>I appreciated the light soup base and the aroma of lamb, but if you 're not into the gamey taste of lamb, you would not enjoy this.</li><li>Lamb Pao Mo This was a decent portion, but it could have used a bit more lamb.</li><li>We sat down &amp;
