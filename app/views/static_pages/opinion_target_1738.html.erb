<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1738' %><h2>beef shank<br />occurrence: 2</h2><div><ol><li>A couple years back I guess due to the relative obscurity of the `` bun bo Hue'' dish, they renamed themselves adding the `` pho'' as that seemed to be the only food non-Vietnamese knew about Vietnamese cuisine Let 's get to the food: bun bo Hue is a vermicelli dish, with beef shank, pork, lemongrass and lots of other herbs.</li><li>Most recommended dish will be obviously their pho dac biet ( special famous beef noodle soup) with all the works including thinly sliced beef, beef balls, beef shank, beef tendon ( mmm my favourite!) and noodle with lots of bean sprouts and mint.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
