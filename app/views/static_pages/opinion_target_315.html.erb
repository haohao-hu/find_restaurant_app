<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 315' %><h2>lamb shank<br />occurrence: 13</h2><div><ol><li>Our only issue was with the lamb skewer dish that used lamb shank as its basis and thus was hard to chew ... perhaps if they had used 2nd cut lamb it would have worked out better.</li><li>Her lamb shank was one of my favourite dishes here.</li><li>Mussel has nothing special, the special recommendation of carppacio and lamb shank from the owner are not up to my expectation for a normal dinner place.</li><li>Another friend ordered the lamb shank and I tried a few bites.</li><li>I wish my stay was longer, so I could have gone back and ordered that lamb shank!</li><li>The lamb shank is fall of the bone tender and the sauce is so flavourful.</li><li>I used to get the lamb shank but that was too inconsistent, so now I almost always get the risotto.</li><li>From chicken and rice to lamb shank to beef stew.</li><li>Ended up getting both the koobideh kebab and rice, and the lamb shank and rice to go.</li><li>Technically, I did n't need to buy anything this time because I had ordered food next door before coming, but I caved and got the lamb shank as well.</li><li>Fairly large lamb shank.</li><li>Here 's the breakdown of food ordered: Appetizers:* Soup of the Day- flavourful and hearty ( 7/10)* Caeser Salad- great flavours, fresh and crisp -- perfect steakhouse caeser ( 9/10)* Spinach Salad- fresh but left much to be desired in flavour ( 6/10) Mains:* Lamb Shank- cooked well and seasoned beautifully but arrived cold ( 7/10)* Chicken- arrived dry and cold but flavour had great potential ( 7/10)* Pasta- looked terrible ( sauce had crusted over) and fellow diner commented that it was one of the worst he 's had ( 4/10) Desserts were rather good, all sampled were 8/10.</li><li>We all ordered the jump escargots, however I would have to say I was disappointed by my lamb shank which came out extremely dry as opposed to tender and falling off the bone.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
