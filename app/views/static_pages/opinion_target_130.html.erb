<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 130' %><h2>served<br />occurrence: 45</h2><div><ol><li>Long line up served quickly.</li><li>As I was about to pay, a old lady ( looks like shes the manager or owner) realized I did not have tea, served it to me and apologized for having too much salmon in my dish.</li><li>Chirashi don ( $ 15.95)- assorted sashimi on rice ( served with salad and miso soup).</li><li>Katsu don ( $ 9.95)- panko-crushed ( sic) pork with egg and onion, served with katsu sauce and rice ( served with salad and miso soup).</li><li>If you 're going with a group I 'd recommend one of the sushi combinations that 's served on a boat.</li><li>I like the bread to start but surprised it 's served with butter packets ..</li><li>Came here again five weeks after their grand opening ( first time I came they had only been open `` fifteen days'' according to the cute host) and there 's the same quality food being served, absolutely fantastic service and no compromises in quality, taste, consistency.</li><li>We all had drinks- the wine was great ( we ordered a some, although they also do BYOW, which is a plus) and I tried a Raspberry cocktail which was also great ( served in a mason jar with mint).</li><li>We found a manager to finally take our order, and told us it was a very busy evening ( so we were not being served, or checked on for an hour because of it ?).</li><li>The servers were friendly, smiling and served us right away after we walked in.</li><li>Best Veal in town!: hell yea! tenderized, and full of flavor, not excessively breaded, not chewy, just perfecto! served with the al-dente spaghetti and marinara! que belissima! 4.5/5 Tartufo! 4/5 chocolata served with whipped cream, and crackers ..... great way to end off the dessert.</li><li>Best Veal in town!: hell yea!

`` everyone knows, when you go to Buk Chang 's, it 's for the soon tofu. unless you have a serious aversion to the texture of silk, do as the locals do and order one of the gloriously smooth tofu soups. they are THE BEST in the city! although, soon tofu is sometimes referred to as stew, it 's more like a light, flavourful broth with pieces of vegetables, tofu, and sometimes meat. it 's served piping hot, and in my opinion, best eaten in the colder months. hints: parking is in the back alley nearby subway is finch station, head south 2 blocks see jimi 's review of the toronto location at: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/buk-chang-dong-soon-tofu-toronto I did n't expect that much from Korean food.</li><li>Menu is tiny, only 9 food items, very limited # of drinks ... was looking for Korean BBQ ribs, none on the menu so I had the broiled BBQ beef which was good, served with a few side dishes, loved the dark little bean type item, not sure what it is though ???</li><li>The soon tofu is served with your choice of beef, seafood, or dumplings, and comes with a bowl of purple rice in a stone bowl.</li><li>Upon complaining, i was told that is the only way it is served despite the server confirming my request for med rare.</li><li>The price is decent and the food 's great. the waiters are always pretty nice and things are served pretty fast, even during rush hours.</li><li>Unfortunately was served by the rudest waiter in my life who thought an attire and a misplaced pride can account for a lack of discipline, manners, or even language knowledge.</li><li>This was proper sushi, served properly.</li><li>Whether it was the Gindara, the chicken terriyaki, black sesame ice cream or being served by dainty and flighty Japanese waitresses dressed in Kimonos, Katsura could do no wrong.</li><li>A few things happened that made me questions the professionalism of the staff: 1) The mug my coffee was served in looked like it have been rubbed against the hood fan in the kitchen before being served.</li><li>Came here for lunch on a Thursday afternoon and we were the only customers being served.</li><li>Next comes garlic bread which was delicious and very garlicky, next were salads which was a bunch of iceberg lettuce and a single slice of tomato, and finally was the entree, served with a choice of potato.</li><li>Then I saw one of the waitresses standing behind the cash register in the narrow aisle texting on her cell phone while I was directly in front of her without being served !!!</li><li>Generous portions, tasty dishes, very reasonable prices for the amount and quality of food being served.</li><li>It 's served all-day so we do n't need to rush.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
