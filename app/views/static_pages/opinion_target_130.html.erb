arviderci Paolo see you soon! this is a really cute place close to my neighborhood, my boyf and i decided to come here after i read some good yelp reviews ( id seen the place before but never got around to actually trying it). the service was so friendly and he gave us 2 coffees for the price of one which was very sweet. i love the decor and music, its very old-timey. i ordered a chicken sandwich and he ordered an eggplant sandwich, which is vegetarian, and they were really good, my only gripe would be that the bread is a bit dry. otherwise its a really nice little place with reasonable prices.</li><li>The music is also loud.</li><li>Do n't mean to hate but the loud rap/club music does n't match the bubble tea cafe vibe ...: p Something more mellow, pls!</li><li>The music was so loud making it easy for the employees to dismiss me.</li><li>The music was n't loud and they had a lot of TVs except b-ball was being shown on every one of them.</li><li>But ... they had good music at least ?</li><li>Loud music too so not a good place for intimacy but late night food, sure!</li><li>Music is all good, with a mix of Korean pop and Korean EDM ?</li><li>Had to carry out a conversation with such demanding music.</li><li>Very nice, tranquil music and good atmosphere.</li><li>The crazy part of this place really starts around 9 when a band goes on that is part russian folk, part 80s hair-band, part wedding band, and plays a mixture of all those types of music.</li><li>When we entered the restaurant it seemed to be very authentic but after we sat down we realized that they were playing like top 40 music and rap.</li><li>But this location is a noisy, drafty place, not unlike an airport cafeteria, with bad music blaring loudly.</li><li>We came on a Sunday, so I cannot comment on the music, but the music they had tonight was a Persian mix and I thought how great that we came on a Sunday, cause you probably would n't be able to hear each other.</li><li>The place was clean, the music was pleasant, and there was a lot of room.</li><li>Vibe- unpretentious, clean, friendly; relaxed ( no worries about being shooed away); and great music ( muddy waters meets blues brothers) Smell- hickory, slow-roasted with hints of garlic ( most overwhelming red meat smells drive me away) Food- I ordered the light-weight ribs and my husband ordered a wings/ribs combo.</li><li>The service was good, the atmosphere intimate with nice instrumental music playing in the back ground.</li><li>First impressions were positive: nice layout and decor, slightly more intimate-feeling booth options, clean washrooms, and music at a reasonable volume.</li><li>It 's just disappointing. one of the best st louis wings places. go on tuesdays, get a beer, wings are half price !!!
