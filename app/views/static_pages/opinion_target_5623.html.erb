<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 5623' %><h2>crab dish<br />occurrence: 1</h2><div><ol><li>Will definitely be coming back to try the crab dish! not quite too sure why this place is so popular. first warning: the waitresses have difficulty with english. this problem was quite apparent the moment we stepped in and asked for a table of four--she pointed at various tables and said things while pointing at them ... and I 'm pretty sure I heard korean, english, and mandarin all thrown in the mix. we wandered around the ( small!) restaurant from table to table as she pointed, confused about where she wanted us to sit. eventually we snagged one of the side booths ( luckily! it looks like the tables are really small, crowded and uncomfortable) but it took them a few minutes to clear off the booth table. even after we sat, we noticed big spills in the middle of the table that had been missed. it took forever to order. the waitresses never came around. when we tried to ask questions about the menu, she just gave us the chinese version ( not particularly helpful, but we had a fun time cross-referencing the korean and chinese like some second-rate linguists). we finally ordered and the side dishes came ... with one spoon short ( ?). we asked for more spoons and more tea three times before they came back with a huge pitcher of tea and abundance of spoons and napkins ... well, I guess that 's effective.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
