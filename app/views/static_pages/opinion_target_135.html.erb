<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 135' %><h2>booths<br />occurrence: 51</h2><div><ol><li>The store went through many interior changes throughout the years and right now they have booths which I like sitting in.</li><li>There are both booths and tables that you can sit at.</li><li>They have a few tables for larger parties ( say six and up), and they 're either large squares ( with the seating running bench-like around it, or large booths.</li><li>There 's about 6 booths in total and long counter in the centre and some tables I believe.</li><li>Service is great, fish is fresh, drinks are cold, booths are intimate.</li><li>Service was fast and place was upscale and very comfy booths.</li><li>They have booths which is nice because although it 's a popular place, you 're not bothered by a lot of noise.</li><li>It 's well designed with lots of open space and comfortable booths.</li><li>I can tell you the inside is very nice with flat screen tv 's and comfortable booths but the food is n't as great as the reviews here suggest.</li><li>I really like the cozy booths and the ambiance.</li><li>Along one side of the restaurant are several booths which can seat around 4 each.</li><li>They have booths that are arranged in a manner that offers you a bit more privacy than other cafes.</li><li>Absolutely love the ambience on the ground floor, especially the booths by the windows.</li><li>Also, it was made for a date night, because all the booths are so private.</li><li>They also have cute booths for couples and a somewhat hidden seating area near the entrance, it 's nice.</li><li>And they have little booths inside perfect for couples.</li><li>Kiyomizu itself is decorated beautifully- there are small strings of lights placed across the restaurant which create an elegant ambiance ( think quiet and intimate, relative to the sports bar feel of Sushi Moto), and the booths are cozy and comfortable.</li><li>There were many empty booths but none was cleaned.</li><li>There are hight tops, booths and the bar to sit at.</li><li>I see the booths, the deep, dark decor reminiscint of a cigar room for proper men.</li><li>We were greeted with a smile and led to a large booth even though it was only me and hubby: I would suggest getting one of the comfy booths around the perimeter because the tables in the middle are squished together so not much leg or elbow room.</li><li>There are three to four private booths which seats up to five for a Korean BBQ session, and about 12 tables on the floor.</li><li>A fun place for one or a group with cool booths that is sectioned off for larger parties.</li><li>The booths are very spacious and I do n't feel cramped at all ( unlike most neighbourhood sushi restaurants) The food prices are fair too.</li><li>Although the booths are a tight squeeze for four adults, the atmosphere is really cute and cozy and everything is neat and tidy.</li><li>Comfy booths.</li><li>Ambience ( 4/5): The place has a modern look to it with some decorations that seem random, but the booths are large and roomy for 4 people so it was a great place to eat in:).</li><li>They have booths, which is always a plus for the privacy when I am coming with a date.</li><li>They have both booths and tables if you want to dine in.</li><li>There 's booths along the wall, or round tables for large groups.</li><li>They also have really neat booths where the tables are very private and there 's a button to call the servers.</li><li>Authentic and tasty. good service and individual booths to serve your party comfortably.</li><li>Nice thing about private booths is that there are cushions for the wooden benches.</li><li>It 's a nice place for a date ( very quiet and the servers will leave you alone unless you call for them), with a bunch of tables and about 4 or 5 booths.</li><li>The atmosphere is really nice and they have these cute booths on the side.</li><li>I like the booths.</li><li>This little caf√© on Yonge and Finch looks big on the outside, as they do have a patio, however there are only about 3 booths inside as the rest of the space are being taken up by their display and cashier spots.</li><li>Once seated the booths were quite comfortable.</li><li>The restaurant has a nice look inside with dark wood trim and furniture, part of an old brick exterior wall, a half-dozen booths and three different types of lighting.</li><li>Definitely a recommendation, but note that they accept cash and debit only, no credit cards. very nice brunch spot, warm cozy environment and nice food. we went in at around 11:15am on a saturday, no queue and had free booths, order two benedict natasha ( that 's egg benedict with smoked salmon and pancake instead of english muffin). we were a little bit surprised with the pancake-based benny, which turned out to be very yum !! i loved it much! we also tried to get the english muffin one, but it was not as good, a bit too toasted and crusty for benny. we would totally recommend the pancake-based ones! a 10-min walk from Lawrence subway station, it was a rather sunny and warm day so it all came to a perfect brunch day!</li><li>I looked around and noticed 2 booths available, I asked the hostess and she said it 's against company policy to seat us at either booth.</li><li>Warm, soft lighting, big comfy chairs, soft cozy booths -- really a great atmosphere for a lounge.</li><li>The place was clean with comfortable booths, so other than the service it had a nice ambiance to it.</li><li>The booths were tiny.</li><li>Spacey comfy booths.</li><li>The lighting is dimmed, with comfy booths, and a full bar.</li><li>Beer makes me happy. this was ok --- SUMMARY --- Plus 's: good place to hang out, decent food, Minus 's: sitting on the patio means breathing all the car exhaust from the cars on Yonge street --- MORE DETAILS --- we choose a platter for two ... it consisted of: very tender chicken ( i picked it up and a piece of meat fell off- SO TENDER) first time i had cornbread- it looked burnt on the bottom, so i just ate the top part not bad ( it would n't ' be my first choice) pulled pork was ok chicken wings were fairly good beef brisket was pretty good .. ribs were kinda dry ... in the end everything kinda tasted the same. fries were good- not too salty. stepping in, the restaurant itself is nice, there are booths or table seating indoors. the main window is a garage front that opens into the patio area facing yonge st. interior has exposed beam ceilings and there 's many nostalgic memorabilia decorated throughout. we ordered a couple of things from the menu 1. spaghetti with beef brisket- yeah i know an experimental dish but i was feeling like spaghetti and if the brisket was good -- you know that would been amazing. unfortunately the brisket was covered in tomato sauce so I could n't taste it in it 's full glory or not ..</li><li>Also I think asian parents should learn that other people do not like having kids screaming all over the restaurant and walking into other peoples ' booths.</li><li>The booths can seat 4 comfortably and maybe 5 depending on how skinny you are.</li><li>My favorite six grains and assorted fungus congee does not have as many of six grains as there are at Congee Queen, and I 'd rather pay few cents more for my extra grains:)) The decor is also a lot simpler and more generic and the seating arrangement is not the greatest with booths lining the sides and round tables put just in front of the entrance, so new customers literally stand over the eating patrons.</li><li>There 's a couple ' private' booths but most of the tables are n't setup like that.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
