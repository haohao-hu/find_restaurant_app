<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 3' %><h2>Staff<br />occurrence: 1032</h2><div><ol><li>Staff are always extremely friendly and attentive and food comes very quickly, no matter how busy it is, although I usually go at lunch on weekdays so it is not overly busy.</li><li>Went here around noon and it got a bit busy, the staff looked like they were in a rush.</li><li>2 stars for lack of parking and hassles I 've had with staff ( owner and son) on two occasions.</li><li>Nice staff as well! 3 stars for the factor that it 's a clean and friendly subway.</li><li>Just one problem: the staff at both restaurants frequently make mistakes in the orders.</li><li>No one working notices and so I pick up everything and put the soup and bag on the counter to show the staff that the bag broke.</li><li>I told them what happened and the staff member told me that she just washed the floor so the soup would be okay.</li><li>Friendly staff and convenient location if you live near the apartments by York U. It reminds me of Panera Bread.</li><li>The staff here is also friendly, attentive and really makes sure that the customers are well taken care of.</li><li>So it seems the new owner has hired unreliable staff, and that 'll cost business in the end.</li><li>The service is pretty good as well and the staff are very friendly.</li><li>Been coming here for years and the food is always yummy, friendly staff, delicious free starters !!</li><li>Food has been consistently good, and staff are always friendly.</li><li>Great prices, friendly staff ( they remember us now years later!) and above average food in huge quantities.</li><li>And yet, this location refuses to staff more than two people after 10pm.</li><li>That being said, it 's a good location and the staff members are very friendly.</li><li>However, on an good note, the staff is really great and friendly.</li><li>The owner remains unchanged, staff are the same, d√©cor untouched.</li><li>The staff are very quick to clean up your plates and bring your drinks.</li><li>Incompetent staff at this KFC location seem incapable of doing takeout orders right.</li><li>I am fed up with the staff at this KFC and I wo n't be back.</li><li>The service in my experience has always been good, the staff is pleasant and very on top of orders.</li><li>The staff is not helpful and what 's appalling is that they do n't know what is in the grilled sandwiches and which one of their items are vegetarian.</li><li>Many of the staff have extreme language barriers.</li><li>The staff would look down at the food, then just stare at us.</li><li>Lines move quickly here and staff are okay.</li><li>The staff are very friendly and I get perfect and fast customer service every time.</li><li>The staff are very friendly and helpful.</li><li>There is no particular `` service'' at a pickup counter but as far as that goes, the staff at Baharan are very accommodating and amicable!</li><li>Server was friendly but I could see the staff idling in the back room making small talk and not being overly attentive to the customers.</li><li>For $ 10 you can have a nice veg option lunch. the staff is super attentive and remembers the clients. more than one time we were recognized and welcomed as special guests. the service is pretty quick so we never had to stay there longer than our allocated 1hr lunch. another point is that they 're good at accommodating larger groups ( we went as a group of 8 + people for lunch few times and never had any issues).</li><li>Sometimes, however, I do need my Timmies fix, and the service is very fast, staff people friendly.</li><li>While the staff are very friendly, I 'm here trying to get some work done while I wait for my car to get fixed and had to stop as my laptop died and there is not ONE customer power outlet.</li><li>Reliable, friendly staff and good selection of filipino goods and cuisine.</li><li>Overall, the staff here are great and if you 're looking to do some work while you 're at the `` coffice'' you cant go wrong !!!</li><li>I was really unsure about the chai coconut milk combo, and I asked the staff if they thought this would be a good combo.</li><li>Also, Tips for wait staff should never be suggested by the person running the till.</li><li>It 's not my problem if you do n't pay your wait staff enough.</li><li>There was only one staff at time when I was there.</li><li>The staff was courteous, especially our cashier.</li><li>Most people who eat here are regulars and the staff loves chatting them up.</li><li>The staff is extremely patient and willing to suggest different items on the menu.</li><li>I do n't think I would return but the staff is friendly and it looked fairly clean.</li><li>The staff were super friendly, and the service, though the food prep was a bit slow, was prompt and accommodating.</li><li>It 's a shame because the staff are pretty nice and sometimes people take it out on them.</li><li>Nope, she was doing that pretty well with her fellow staff.</li><li>The staff are mostly friendly but I do n't understand why they ca n't hire more- I 've been here 20 + times over the last 2 years and I 've waited at least 5-10 minutes AFTER ordering every time.</li><li>On the plus side this location is large and pretty clean, staff could use a bit work in customer service but it was alright Took the guy at cash a bit of time to notice me but other then that no issue with my order Also, 10 nuggets for 1.99 is back.</li><li>The staff are mean and if you Chose the `` all you can eat'' menu and you do n't eat the whole thing they will extra charge you Coz of food waste .me and my friend did n't want to waste anything we just could n't eat it as it was WAY TOO NASTY.</li><li>The waiting staff is quick polite and attentive.</li><li>Then she turned away without helping us to get a box and asked all of the staff who offers us a dollar for a box!</li><li>She was like `` you cannot order only one, you have to order two, it two people'' ( btw the staff hardly know English, so this may have caused misinterpretation).</li><li>Staff were always friendly, attentive, and personable.</li><li>Could not ask for better staff whether it be the employees or management.</li><li>I Sincerely hope this is not the same soap that the staff are using because ai n't NAY-TING getting clean with that subpar soap.</li><li>I suspect animosity between the two staff members).</li><li>The staff has generally been very pleasant.</li><li>I 'm not a big burger eater but this place is fantastic and the staff are very friendly Overall a great experience and most importantly the birthday boy was happy:).</li><li>But I was a bit annoyed that our burgers ( two burgers, two poutines and two pops) cost as much as the 4 burger, 4 pop and 2 side `` family combo'' The staff were just ok.</li><li>Hence my experience was ruined by rude staff!</li><li>The staff seem a bit frazzled and mechanic, making the environment a bit cold and dull.</li><li>Franchise experience should be consistent, the environment, food all has been predetermined, it 's usually the staff that can make it or break it for a location.</li><li>We were greeted by every wait staff we passed on the way in and out.</li><li>The restaurant looks absolutely amazing, classy decor, trendy vibe and really friendly and helpful staff.</li><li>Always friendly staff, and fresh fish.</li><li>Friendly staff.</li><li>It is technically run by a lot of Koreans I believe but that does n't matter, but food is the great, the staff is friendly and helpful and the pieces they put out look great.</li><li>Amazing staff.</li><li>Plates kept piling and piling and none of the staff can be bothered to serve them.</li><li>Wait staff were nice and also friendly.</li><li>The staff is full of cute asian girls that are happier than the whole sailor moon clique.</li><li>With each spontaneous visit, the food is always delicious, the staff are superb ( service and attentiveness) and overall I love the vibe here.</li><li>It 's quite spacious a variety of seating is available and extremely efficient staff!</li><li>One time they forgot the water and I had to ask someone else so that 's why I give it 4/5 but other than that good place! we stopped by for lunch today. the decor looked fancy, i like the environment. the price tag is a bit on the expensive side. you 're looking at 20-30 dollars easy per person. i do like their quality of food. we had some salmon and tuna nigiris and they were pretty fresh! the staff there are attentive. cute place! although this place was suggested by my cousin ( because his friend owns the place), i was unimpressed by their sushi/sashimi. it was n't fresh! yes, the place is nice, trendy and huge, but i would n't go here for their sushi.</li><li>A very inviting staff and management.</li><li>We made reservations ahead of time and that day we were running a bit late so we called in and the staff were really kind about it and said no problem.</li><li>Friendly staff and fast service.</li><li>All of the staff are `` white washed'' with great service.</li><li>Excellent service and the staff are terrific make you feel like your in their home.</li><li>Really nice dim atmosphere with very friendly staff!</li><li>Staff are nice.</li><li>Cozy atmosphere and clean place. staff was really quick and helpful with the services.</li><li>Let 's start with the staff, I 've never had a bad experience here and I come here at least once a week for the past 3 years.</li><li>Restaurant was very comfortable and the staff was approachable and welcoming.</li><li>First thing I really want to say about Sushi Moto before I say anything else is ... the staff !!</li><li>Hands down the nicest staff in any restaurant I have been too.</li><li>The incredibly friendly staff was able to seat me and my date right away, and gave us a nice cozy booth at the back of the restaurant.</li><li>The staff were very friendly and attentive.</li><li>We come here regularly and always have our large celebrations ( birthdays) here and the staff is always great, and friendly.</li><li>The staff are very friendly, and kind.</li><li>I make sure to tip big because the staff are attentive, and take care of their guests.</li><li>The fish is fresh, the staff is attentive ( sometimes a touch overattentive, and a little touchy-feely), and the bar is new and clean.</li><li>Would definitely go back again! super clean restaurant, good food, nice staff and the food is very pretty there is parking at the back for those who dont know.</li><li>The food is amazing, the place is clean and the staff is always polite.</li><li>There is a `` don'' of the place reminiscent of the head don in Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift that keeps a watchful eye on everything, a couple of floor managers and wait staff dressed in black.</li><li>All of the staff are `` white washed'' with great service.</li><li>Overall, just a crappy experience. been here only few times and always for lunch. lunch options are very good and at least vegetarian options are pretty cheap ( tofu bento box + soup + salad = $ 7). the food is yummy! and they have some interesting appetizers like avocado tempura! which is just delicious! the staff is friendly and helpful.</li><li>Host ( ess) and first impression: Greeted at door by possible managerial staff.</li><li>Good service and friendly staff with a great atmosphere!</li><li>For such a price amazing taste highly recommended interior design needs to be updated thanks for the staff being gentle and helpful.</li><li>Sushi was done right, sign of a skilled sushi chef and staff.</li><li>The staff are my favourite.</li><li>I did always find the staff to be very rude, and they seemed to purposely ignore you.</li><li>If you 're going to go, the Keg Mansion on Church has a great atmosphere and wait staff that are happy to chat up the ghost stories.</li><li>I was surprised and amused that one of their patrons held a Labrador Retriever as guide dog and was welcomed by the staff who apparently knows him ( or them) too well.</li><li>Staff was nice.</li><li>The staff seem to enjoy chatting about the items on the menu.</li><li>The staff and the food were a perfect symbiosis.</li><li>I definitely think Il Fornello is under staff, the wait staffs are overwhelmed and that led to decline of services.</li><li>Great service and very friendly staff!</li><li>The owners and staff are extremely friendly and nice.</li><li>The staff are n't the best though.</li><li>Pizza nova pizza is pretty much the same at all location, but this one has a great staff.</li><li>The pizza is fresh, the staff is friendly.</li><li>Our order- Greek salad to share, chicken souvlaki with home made pita, 4 topping medium pizza, and Greek wine. ( seems like those are the consistent recommendations by the staff) ...</li><li>The first 2 times were great- food was delicious, decent portions, and good staff.</li><li>The staff are somewhat rude when the restaurant is busy, which is understandable, because it is usually packed.</li><li>The staff are kind and helpful as well.</li><li>Friendly staff, clean, maintained washrooms, hot food, fresh salads.</li><li>After a night of shopping, it 's a great, casual place to dine with friendly staff and no worries about food quality.</li><li>But you 'll come back because the food is simple and good and the staff are friendly.</li><li>The staff focused more on the tables around us then us, and left a bunch of dirty plates piling up on the table beside us .. like that was their drop off station instead of taking them to the kitchen.</li><li>Service could be better but most of the staff is older so it 's expected.</li><li>They welcome little kids, and the staff is friendly.</li><li>The staff if really friendly but the sheesha is shit.</li><li>The taste was not very good and the staff were not friendly.</li><li>Come here if you need your Korean food fix! the staff were very friendly and welcoming! delicious raw veal bibimbap and chicken ginseng soup!</li><li>Service: Friendly staff, coming at the exact perfect times.</li><li>Before I comment on the delicious food at Koryo, I just want to say I love their staff!</li><li>Great service, friendly staff and good food.</li><li>The staff also do not hesitate to refill any of them for you.</li><li>Such a clean, modern place with friendly staff.</li><li>They 'd pour the bbq sauce on the patty at the table for you, and the staff even put her hand over the hot plate to make sure nothing gets sprayed onto me.</li><li>Also, the staff came to check on us two times and were quite responsive every time we asked for something.</li><li>The place is clean and staff is friendly.</li><li>The staff were so cute and friendly too.</li><li>Nice decor, friendly staff.</li><li>The staff can be difficult if you need to send something back.</li><li>Very professional staff and high quality dishes are why I give it 3 stars and would come back to see what a non-fried experience would be like.</li><li>My suggestion would be to take Devan R with you, or to even ask one of the helpful staff.</li><li>Service was great very attentive staff.</li><li>Great service though and friendly staff.</li><li>Nowhere have I experienced better service from not just our waiter but each and every member of the staff.</li><li>When asking for some recommendations from the staff on what noodles to get the answer was `` everything is good, depends what you like'' ( typical!) so I picked the house special and they totally went well with the szechuan chicken we got.</li><li>Staff is helpful and friendly, and portions are very generous!</li><li>But the food is absolutely wonderful. we are regular customer, s at this restaurant, Tonight we ordered the usual, our favourte dish is peanut chicken, we brought our three dish, s home and upon opening the chicken we saw half the dish was peanut sauce and less than half the usual amount of chicken, I called the restaurant and spoke to the owner for ten minutes, she insisted that it was made the same as always, It was not at all, we paid 11,95 for peanut sauce and a small amount of chicken,, The arrogant owner could not care less, refusing to credit us for next time we picked up, or d delivering a new dish to our home, This place the staff is unfriendly, not well mannered, and horrible customer service, and the food was awful, except for the fried rice, it was good, If your looking for bad service this is the place to go, the customer is never right,, be warned,.</li><li>Since the crabs were kept whole- which is how it 's supposed to be anyways- I would have appreciated more if the staff provided us with a knife or scissors to cut the crab into bite size pieces.</li><li>I only gave a 4 star due to the service- i find that service is not very consistent with the staff at this restaurant.</li><li>I have been coming here for almost 20 years and have never had any incidents with rude staff.</li><li>SUPER slow staff !!!</li><li>The staff was so friendly and helpful, they let me customize my pizza and it was prepared quickly.</li><li>If you ask politely, most of the staff members will even make you a pizza just the way you like it.</li><li>First, every time I order soup, it is always served stone cold and when I ask the staff to warm it up, they get all huffy about it.</li><li>Good food, elegantly served by friendly staff.</li><li>All the other staff saw and knew what was going on.</li><li>The staff was friendly and the young lady serving us was very kind and asked us throughout if we needed anything, even though the place was jam packed and she was attending multiple tables.</li><li>Several times the radio was blaring horrible static and the staff refused to change the channel or turn it down despite the interference.</li><li>Twice I 've come to this Cora 's, and twice the staff has been lazy, forgetful, and improperly trained.</li><li>People will finish their meal and leave their table and the staff will either: a) ignore the abandoned table that needs to be bussed for far too long or b) they 'll buss the table and let the clean empty table just sit there empty while ignoring people waiting to be sat because they prefer to seat in the order you arrive.</li><li>The staff are attentive and very nice!</li><li>The staff is nice and knowledgeable.</li><li>Very friendly staff and accommodating.</li><li>Food is zero, staff is five stars so ...</li><li>Friendly staff.</li><li>He brought it to the attention of restaurant staff and they made him a new one but I 've never seen such a huge, black dead fly stuck in some food before.</li><li>The staff is attentive and friendly.</li><li>Prices are great and staff friendly.</li><li>The hostess and wait staff seem over worked and appear unmotivated.</li><li>The food is decent for the price, the staff is very friendly with excellent customer service love there Pad Thai &amp; rolls.</li><li>The staff is polite and courteous but just cannot seem to cope with the workload Personally, I do not like a gap between dishes, meaning I hate to wait.</li><li>We wanted to do the all you can eat menu but were told right away by the server that we wo n't be able to do that as they cannot have all staff busy with all you can eat orders close to the closing time.</li><li>The staff was really helpful and found us a seat a little further away.</li><li>They have sashimi, for some reason the menu says that you can only order 5 pieces per person but I always order more and that seems to be on with the staff.</li><li>And sexy summer rolls are the non-fried ones- they have avocado, lettuce, crab or shrimp, other greenery and come wrapped in a see through rice paper. yummmmzeeerrrzzzzz The staff at the Sheppard and Yonge location are super nice.</li><li>The staff is very nice and treat you well- I guess they are aware that we are frustrated with the wait.</li><li>The staff was very friendly -- they asked all the right questions to cover all bases, and it was spiced just like I wanted: just a bit of spice, nothing overpowering.</li><li>Nice staff taking order and prepping the Rotis and Meals.</li><li>The staff were lovely ...</li><li>A great place, friendly staff, nice family business.</li><li>Looked like the staff were enjoying working here.</li><li>The staff was making a lot of mistakes as customers kept coming back with missing items.</li><li>The staff was n't really too efficient, I see a lot of people at the back and they did n't adjust to prevent people waiting in the tills.</li><li>The staff here are very demoralized, passive aggressive, and take it out on customers.</li><li>I mean you get what you get it 's McDonald 's, I just wish it was consistent. horrible staff and staff manager-customer service is zero here! customer service attendee started yelling at my mom for asking a simple question regarding her order-avoid this location at all costs! they are so cheap that they even charge for Mayo-get your shit together McDonalds.</li><li>I mean you get what you get it 's McDonald 's, I just wish it was consistent. horrible staff and staff manager-customer service is zero here! customer service attendee started yelling at my mom for asking a simple question regarding her order-avoid this location at all costs! they are so cheap that they even charge for Mayo-get your shit together McDonalds.</li><li>This chain of McD 's has computer for ordering if you can pay in credit or debit, and while waiting in line I found that the staff was busy diverting people to the computer kiosks ... while there were 3 cashiers available, only 1 was being used.</li><li>Manager ( ? woman in blouse and red scarf) was standing around not doing much while some of the staff were busting their butts off.</li><li>The staff however ... not so nice, rude actually.</li><li>The staff is always accommodating and their lunch specials are priced well.</li><li>I 'm vegan and the staff always makes sure everything is made without animal products for me.</li><li>The service has always been very efficient and staff are very nice.</li><li>Staff was friendly and service fast.</li><li>Staff are nice.</li><li>The staff is nice and attentive and the restaurant itself is clean and tidy.</li><li>Staff is nice and attentive though.</li><li>Wait staff are nice but do n't understand much English.</li><li>I come here all the time: the staff are friendly and there 's quite a bit of variety in the menu.</li><li>Nevertheless, loved that the staff were sweet to take extra care to make sure that walnuts were not added to the rice cake shaved ice- our son has a peanut/Pinenut allergy and thy took extra precautions for us with nuts in general.</li><li>My issue is n't with the decor or staff, but with God awful drink I had to awkwardly sip during my time there.</li><li>Also, the wifi was not working for us although we mentioned it to the staff 3x and all they told us was to restart our computers ( although the wifi did n't even work on our phones either).</li><li>With a very friendly staff with a nice smile located on the 2nd floor a little hidden but once you go in, you hear the sounds of Korean songs playing but not upbeat but more relaxing kind ? ( I do n't make sense) The food is delicious though it is kinda pricey for me.</li><li>The place is cozy with friendly staff.</li><li>During that time, most of the staff only spoke Korean, and the desserts were not very good.</li><li>However, once we got seated, the staff was very friendly and the food ( wings) was amazing!</li><li>Nice staff, good food and a nice atmosphere.</li><li>All staff make you feel right at home, my favourite server is Holly, she is so sweet and makes you feel very welcome.</li><li>Friendly staff.</li><li>Good food and staff were friendly, the burgers are fantastic.</li><li>The staff are friendly and helpful.</li><li>Their main dish is bad and the staff are rude to you and unwelcoming.</li><li>The staff were awful literally looked bored and not interested in their job.</li><li>The service is always quick and the staff are fluent in English Vietnamese and Cantonese.</li><li>Lovely staff who will explain anything to you.</li><li>I 'm assuming everyone here are regulars, but everyone was really friendly ( both staff and customers).</li><li>( Ok, some of the food, her other staff helped, but she did n't really move down the table accept to TAKE the order, and to pick up the bills.</li><li>The strangest part of the visit was that the decor was hardcore Greek, but the staff ( and possibly owners too) are Korean or Chinese.</li><li>Pros: Variety of dishes to choose from Prices are very good for some items Friendly staff Cons: No wow factor at all I came with a group of 8 so I got to see a good variety of dishes Sorento makes.</li><li>The prices are good and the staff is friendly.</li><li>Friendly staff.</li><li>Very friendly staff with excellent service.</li><li>Service from all the staff is excellent.</li><li>Came in for dinner with my girlfriend, the place is nice and inviting, well maintained and friendly staff.</li><li>The staff is always top notch, the food is too!</li><li>I have visited the place more than 50 times and I keep wondering how they manage to always keep around the most professional of service staff, I took 4 of my office associates out for lunch and we each ordered a drink, an appetizer and a main course, waitress serving us memorized each of our orders without writing it down, while some upscale places have up to 3 people serving a table of five and would still manage to misplace or confuse an item or two per order.</li><li>The skilled staff here do a great job of making their patrons feel welcome which is why I 'll return again and again.</li><li>Staff was attentive and friendly and seemed to make strong recommendations from the menu but not so much from the cocktail menu.</li><li>Little that was offered to us by The Miller staff and kitchen enhanced our evening, and the success of our family dinner was in spite of The Miller rather than because of it.</li><li>Those adult guests were unfair to bring those children there at all, and your staff knew exactly what would happen once our party arrived.</li><li>Great great restaurant ... have been going here for years ... under a different owner ... never the less I continued to get the same amazing service ... staff us very attentive ... must try everyone is the portobello mushroom salad ... for our main entree we always ended making our dish picking from different entrees ... wat I do miss is a grilled jumbo tiger shrimp the previous owner used to make me .... he said it was my special thing .... and mayb an addition of a triple chocolate cake/cheese cake .... it wud make a difference in the desert ... it did enjoyed today 's tirimisu.</li><li>The staff were very friendly.</li><li>We were greeted by very friendly staff and excellent service.</li><li>The staff is extremely friendly.</li><li>Staff was attentive and went above and beyond when I asked what types of mushrooms were in my dish, he came back with a list ...</li><li>However, during busy dinner time, I think they are under staff The ambience: 10/10 The restaurant is very dim which I like.</li><li>I 'm always a fan of leaving a restaurant and the entire staff thanks you.</li><li>Overall a good experience since the sashimi was done really well and the staff there were so friendly and welcoming.</li><li>When you enter the restaurant almost all of the staff great u which for me is impressive!</li><li>Second, the staff.</li><li>Bottomline, Get take out and avoid the staff.</li><li>The staff really know us there, and we have taken friends there for lunch or dinner several times over the years.</li><li>We quickly became frequent cravers and I cannot be more happy with a place that believe in making sure their customers are happy and I 've seen the staff here welcome new faces and old ones with the most positive approach getting you hooked on their grub.</li><li>He explained to us how busy they were and that there were n't enough staff in the restaurant because they did n't expect that many guests on Thursday night.</li><li>The restaurant only had a few tables at the time and the staff were n't doing anything, just socializing with each other ...</li><li>Seems like they had a staff overhaul because this time the food was cooked properly and it was actually tasty.</li><li>Had the following Calamari- Not too greasy, could be a bit crispier but thoroughly enjoyed it with the Cajun dip Tortilla and Dip- Tasty and refills of tortillas was offered by our server Ribs with Fries n Beans- Ribs were prepared quite good, fall off the bone, not too fatty, not too much muscle fibers, sauce was good, fries were crispy, bans were not mush, definitely recommended NY and Top Sirloin Steak was cooked proper to medium rare, for the price it had a decent depth of flavor, salad that came with it was pretty standard, veggies were cooked well, mashed potatoes was good, first time having the Peppercorn sauce not taste like burnt chocolate, bravo to the new kitchen staff Probably will come back but I 'll probably request Miranda as my server as there 's been too many servers that take their job for granted at this location.*** note they do n't validate parking anymore 2apps 3 entrees Above average gratuity Around $ 150 for 3 happy and full people Will come back to this location if I 'm having a craving for tender ribs.</li><li>All staff were very rude and seemed to be very unhappy with their job.</li><li>They sat us at a table for more than 15 minutes without one single staff seemed to care about us to even offer us a glass of water!</li><li>The staff are very nice and pleasant.</li><li>The service was quick and staff was friendly.</li><li>There is a mustard &amp; ketchup station with push buttons slightly to the left of the Wendy 's ordering counter, but salt, pepper and plastic cutlery are no longer longer available at this station; you have to ask counter staff for those items, which is NOT IMO an improvement, given this is a very busy restaurant all the time, always line ups, as we who live in Weston have few dining options;_; ( For God 's sake, food franchises &amp; restaurant chains, take pity on Weston- Lawrence &amp; open up some businesses here!)</li><li>Friendly staff and at times during high peak hours it 's difficult for them to manage.</li><li>The staff acted very unprofessionally and instead of silencing them or asking them to leave, they claimed it 's our fault and we must leave the restaurant !!</li><li>It could be better by hiring more staff to get things done faster.</li><li>It 's not much to look at on the outside, and the inside is cluttered and a little dated, but the staff ( owners ?) are friendly and knowledgeable about what they 're serving and the food 's good.</li><li>The staff is always friendly and appreciative of their customers ' business.</li><li>This place has some of the friendliest staff I 've ever met.</li><li>All the time the staff has been very attentive to my orders.</li><li>I know this is standard service in Japan where even the staff at McDonalds are super friendly, but whenever I see it Toronto, it 's a welcome breath of fresh air.</li><li>Sashimi boat- Each piece was thick and evenly sliced Service Great staff Decor There are individual rooms with curtains or tables in the main dining area.</li><li>I love their staff and service ( although it can get quite busy on holidays and weekends), the atmosphere is simple and homey, the food is always great.</li><li>The staff are so friendly and hard working.</li><li>From walking in, we were grreeted by literally all the staff smiling at us and the venue is absolutely adorable.</li><li>Take-out service was fast and the ambiance and staff were so welcoming.</li><li>Great atomosphere, and great staff.</li><li>Yes, the decor leaves much to be desired but the staff are friendly, if not a tad on the slow side service-wise.</li><li>But for the most part it 's a wonderful spot, the staff are genuine, kind and lovely.</li><li>The staff are fantastic, especially for those who may have forgotten what customer service looks and sounds like.</li><li>I was very impressed, the staff here are amazing and SUPER friendly.</li><li>Ca n't say enough good things about the staff here!:).</li><li>Service 4.0/5- The staff is very friendly here all the way down from the chef to the hostess to the servers.</li><li>Food is promptly brought to you and from the times I 've been there, the staff is always checking up to make sure your tea is filled; the hostess comes by to check on you; even the sushi chef/owner comes by to say hi ( obviously, when it 's not too busy).</li><li>The staff were super attentive to us and came around often to serve us tea, refill apps etc.</li><li>The fish was fresh, the staff were attentive, and there were decent apps that I did n't expect to get ( always a nice surprise!).</li><li>My brother in law reported that he visits Sam Jung at least twice a week- every staff member knew him and his regular order- which misled me to believe that we were in for a treat.</li><li>The owners and staff are Korean.</li><li>While we felt awkward asking, the staff were more than happy to clear off the sushi bar for us, so we sat down &amp; ordered.</li><li>All of the staff seemed very enthused by our presence at the sushi bar and we were comped an amazingly delicious whole grilled saba ( mackerel- 5 stars).</li><li>It 's a little difficult to imagine so you will have to go there and see it for yourself* wink* Aside from an inceredible ambiance, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful.</li><li>Even the other staff were all smiling and greeting us too.</li><li>You will feel so welcomed because the staff will make you feel that way.</li><li>Samjung Sushi staff were amazing.</li><li>This location, a little smaller than the others, has the usual great selection- staff who are trying their best to ensure they 're giving good service, and of course, the child play pen.</li><li>Staff was friendly and always smiling.</li><li>Their food is always fresh and the staff is super friendly!</li><li>The staff are experienced and seem to enjoy what they are doing.</li><li>I was disappointed as I only ate one piece .... not impressed with the office staff right now.</li><li>We were a group of ten and when we walked in, there was no recognition at all from any of the staff.</li><li>It was actually challenging to even make eye contact with the staff, I know they were ignoring us.</li><li>Eventually one of the staff seated us and then we waited another 20 minutes.</li><li>With difficulty I flagged one of the staff and was casually told to go place our order down at the end of the hallway past the washrooms.</li><li>The staff explained that this was self-serve and all the food had to be paid for before they brought it out to us.</li><li>The staff at the cashier did n't have a menu to show us.</li><li>After a big kerfuffle between a couple of staff members, a menu was brought to us at the cashiers.</li><li>We ended up with too much food, and the staff were bringing it and ' dumping' it at our table.</li><li>And when there was no room to put anymore plates on the table, the staff handed the food to us !!</li><li>The staff were avoiding the customers and generally looked miserable and overworked.</li><li>I do not blame the staff for our terrible experience.</li><li>The service was exceptional in Dundas Square, all the staff were awesome and took care of ordering and bringing over the food.</li><li>Even when the place was packed, you felt relaxed and in good hands with staff who were attentive and noticed immediately when a customer looked up and needed something.</li><li>Hire a manager to oversee the staff.</li><li>Staff was a little confused since they were on training, which is understandable.</li><li>Confused staff.</li><li>Extremely kind and good looking wait staff.</li><li>This place just opened up and will take some work before the staff gets it right.</li><li>Some of the staff are n't the smartest, but most were uber friendly and attentive ( Kandice was the best!).</li><li>The staff were polite, but because it was so busy they were not as attentive as I would have liked.</li><li>They had so many staff around I do n't understand why they do n't have table service.</li><li>But it 's a clean restaurant and the staff are really accommodating, even putting Treehouse on the TV for my two-year-old instead of golf for a few of the regulars.</li><li>The best halibut and chips in the city I have tried yet, and I 've lived in Toronto for over 30 years ( staff is also super friendly and deserve a raise no matter how much they 're making).</li><li>Both the staff and customers are older, and everyone seems really nice and professional.</li><li>Great staff- they explain all the confusing burger choices and toppings for you.</li><li>Insufficient staff at the counter 2.</li><li>Insufficient staff to clean up the restaurant 4.</li><li>The metal round trays were all stacked up at the cleaning station but obviously the staff just has no time to come and clean up We found a spot and I cleaned up the table with serviettes.</li><li>Suggestion: hire staff, train them about food handling ... please .. before the Toronto food inspection gives you a yellow pass!</li><li>Staff look like they do n't want to be there.</li><li>Wait staff can often give you recommendation, if you ask.</li><li>The waitress was just sitting around talking on the phone and occasionally would be screaming screaming with the staff in the back.</li><li>The staff are very friendly too.</li><li>There are a surprisingly large number of staff there, but only two of them are doing any work.</li><li>Somehow the staff seems always annoyed.</li><li>I 'm happy it did n't rub off on the other staff here.</li><li>The owners have attitude problems and its evident as the staff turnover is so high, no wonder there is no consistency in quality.</li><li>The staff were friendly and helpful when we had questions about the menu.</li><li>The staff even knew them by first name!</li><li>Having a great, friendly, informative staff is something that will keep customers coming back ... and of course, the food has to be good!</li><li>As I mentioned, the staff were amazing and the food was even better!</li><li>I should also mention the ladies at the counter ( and Tutto 's staff in general) are always super nice.</li><li>So if you want quality and not following a hype then this restaurant is the best decision although the staff could use a little bit of finesse when handling certain situations.</li><li>The staff gave us recommendations and they were all amazing.</li><li>The first time I walked in I think I was the only non-Filipino there, and the staff welcomed me and immediately gave me a crash course in Filipino cuisine- the meal was incredible.</li><li>Super down to earth and friendly staff, would absolutely recommend to friends.</li><li>The staff is very friendly and I like the salad bar.</li><li>Minus one star because the staff ca n't be bothered to look ( much less smile) at you, and because the quality of the smoothies has gone way down, while the price has gone up.</li><li>ONE OF THE WORSE SPOTS AT YORK! first: its pricey! second: their staff are the rudest especially the blonde lady that owns it and her red hair companion! third: i do feel the owner is a racist lady, I have seen enough situations especially with specific backgrounds and things that happened to my friends that proves it.</li><li>Good stuff: service was quick and staff were average nice.</li><li>I would just say the service was bad today- and they were n't short staff at all ....</li><li>Walk in, you must hear Vietnamese music, the furniture should be simple and perhaps dated, and the staff should be speaking a lot of loud Vietnamese to each other.</li><li>There 's quite a bit of seating for such a small spot, bathrooms are clean and staff is friendly enough.</li><li>The line is always long but I 've never had to wait more than 2 minutes, so the staff here know how to keep things moving along.</li><li>The service there is very fast and the staff is amazing!</li><li>The staff is super nice and price is fair, just not my Kind of Korean resturant, I 'll try it again tho.</li><li>Service: Most of the staff speaks Mandarin, but they do understand Cantonese and English.</li><li>Service was very good, and the food came very fast, staff were friendly and most of the orders arrived correctly.</li><li>- Clean &amp; staff are n't rude.</li><li>Service ( 4.5/5): So their staff was n't particularly friendly or anything, but we got food FAST.</li><li>The staff definitely needs to improve on getting the customer the correct order and not bring out the wrong items. for that- 1star As for service in general, the staff is friendly and quick.</li><li>The staff definitely needs to improve on getting the customer the correct order and not bring out the wrong items. for that- 1star As for service in general, the staff is friendly and quick.</li><li>The chef and staff eat with the customers .. which is unheard of.</li><li>Lots of staff wandering around means your order sheet is taken quickly once shoved in the air and empty dishes are cleared away within seconds of emptying.</li><li>No system at the door leaves a crowd by the entry/exit and whoever gets the attention of the staff first gets a table first; no way you 're getting to sit first if you 're in the door first but not remotely pushy.</li><li>Able to.maintain the food quality, very attended staff, friendly, service in good standard, sashimi is always fresh, sushi rolls has the right portion of rice, weekends they serve scallop sashimi, spicy tuna hand roll, variety of good quality sashimi choices. reasonable priced and dessert is average.</li><li>Friendly staff:) food comes quickly.</li><li>They staff mostly just shepherded food and plates to and from the kitchen.</li><li>The staff is nice, the food arrives quickly and the price is reasonable.</li><li>I noticed all the staff that served our table spoke Mandarin which points to the clientele that come here.</li><li>Variety is great; service is better than most sushi places, at least for AYCE ( like they do n't forget items that you 've ordered and the staff are reasonably friendly); I just wish it was cheaper ...</li><li>VERY efficient staff, whatever was asked, they provided ASAP.</li><li>But the staff were very good with helping us to get the missing items so we were not too bother by it.</li><li>Staff is very attentive and fast.</li><li>I keep coming back because of the sashimi, the reasonable AYCE price for seniors, and the warm welcome from the staff.</li><li>Service was great, staff were readily available and items were served as ordered ( I am sure it is the bane of everyone 's AYCE experience when ordered items are MIA).</li><li>At one point we sat around for 15 minutes with an empty table, having to call to 4 staff members that we were still missing 6 dishes.</li><li>Have some business sense. the best sushi ever, the most unique rolls, quality ingredients, excellent staff and service, must come back !! puts sushi on the level of heaven.</li><li>Staff are efficient and friendly most of the time !!</li><li>The staff seemed okay to me.</li><li>It was clean, the staff was alright, but extremely inefficient.</li><li>Another staff member stood beside him and made change, then disappeared into the back.</li><li>All the staff always serve with a smile on their faces.</li><li>Overall, service and food were quick, staff were attentive and all of our needs were met regardless of how busy it was.</li><li>Service was decent- all our food came out within five minutes, but there was never any water refills- I think the staff got quite busy during the lunch rush.</li><li>They clearly are very used to being packed all the time so there as no slacking off, very pleasant and prompt staff, and the food arrived considerably quick. cash and debit only here which is a bummer.</li><li>SERVICE: PRO: The staff is friendly and very polite.</li><li>Probably one of the best Starbucks staff.</li><li>The staff here are friendly and some even go the extra mile to make sure I leave satisfied- they 've offered to re-make my drink twice on days when the situations looked a bit doubtful.</li><li>I do like this location for the convenience and friendliness of the staff ...</li><li>The nicest staff and decent wait times.</li><li>The staff are super friendly and the wings are the best.</li><li>The staff was friendly and checked on us which is rare.</li><li>Cozy restaurant and staff friendly!</li><li>Hope they come back cause the staff are friendly and efficient.</li><li>Friendly staff and fresh food due to it being very popular.</li><li>But the staff there is just so darned nice that it 's hard to criticize them.</li><li>I found this place while wedding venue shopping and it was recommended by the venue staff.</li><li>While I was there, the staff discovered a phone on the counter that had been left by someone.</li><li>The staff works quickly and effectively.</li><li>This place reminds me so much of all the Hungarian Places that used to be along Bloor in the Annex--the strange decor, the menu with the liquor listed at the end, the staff and the way the place fills up at a drop of a hat.</li><li>They have great old world charm, wonderful and attentive staff, many of which know my mother-in-law by name, and an expansive menu.</li><li>The decor is n't spectacular, but the staff are reasonably kind and the food arrived quickly.</li><li>The waitress was nice but very rushed, being the only wait staff working on this Sat night.</li><li>Staff is always friendly.</li><li>The staff had proper manners, good timing, and our food were served quite fast yet everything was cooked well!</li><li>For some reason, the staff who bring the food never seemed to know where the meals would go.</li><li>But whatever the case is, the Fox and the Fiddle needs to spend more time training staff.</li><li>Dont forget to bring your id, besides that the food is good and the staff is a welcoming group.</li><li>Nice staff.</li><li>The staff are fairly quick to serve you and your food comes out fast and furious.</li><li>Cheap prices, and friendly staff.</li><li>When i arrived on a Friday night i did n't see the usual long line, as i was expecting to wait in line as usual for a table ... it was 3/4 empty ... i did n't sense the usual smell in the air of that great food being cooked from the kitchen ... i did n't recognize any of the staff at all ...</li><li>Eddie one of the owners was n't there and the staff did n't even know who i was talking about when i asked about him.</li><li>What sets a McDonald 's apart are the staff.</li><li>Most of the staff here show customers how much they hate their jobs.</li><li>The staff are n't friendly at all.</li><li>The staff were very friendly with customers which makes me believe they are treated well and genuinely happy to be there.</li><li>The food and kitchen staff are amazing!</li><li>When you order take-out you enter the kitchen to pick up your food so you can see how clean the kitchen is and how professional looking the kitchen staff look.</li><li>The staff &amp; owner are warm and friendly and the food is delicious!</li><li>The staff are very friendly and the service is great ...</li><li>The staff is friendly &amp; service is good.</li><li>Not sure if they 've changed kitchen staff over the years ( since it 's the same owners, I did recognize one of the ladies who took customers ' orders), but the meal was just pretty disappointing.</li><li>Quiet staff.</li><li>I was fully prepared to sulk and complain, but the staff were too friendly for that.</li><li>While St. Louis on York Mills is not my go-to for a romantic dinner and also not a gastro-pub experience ... it 's got friendly staff and a quiet atmosphere on weekdays.</li><li>I decided to go to Yorkdale today just for the Lebanese food because I did remember their friendly staff and fresh food in the past.</li><li>There is only really 4 things i order from this place. super chirashi ( approx $ 14) enough food for you to take some home salmon chirashi ( $ 10)- never failed me sushi chirashi ( great assortment $ 10) ( accept requests for substitutes if you dont like shrimp, white tuna .. etc) uni sushi ( $ 5/2PCS)- SUPER fresh and not available during off season service can be kinda slow at times and staff tend to be loud when the restaurant is empty and ive seen the kitchen staff sitting next to us eating their meals however, like one of the previous yelper said the chirashi keeps me coming back for more. parking is the worst part about going to this restaurant.</li><li>There is only really 4 things i order from this place. super chirashi ( approx $ 14) enough food for you to take some home salmon chirashi ( $ 10)- never failed me sushi chirashi (

wine/sake/soju selection and i get the impression that the staff are not quite knowledgeable. ive ordered beef sashimi, and chicken katsu in the past but i dont think that the quality is anything worth trying.</li><li>I can always get a table here and the staff is really friendly.</li><li>The staff are friendly and attentive and the general ambience is inviting and warm.</li><li>This way, this eliminates the communication challenges; thus, allowing their staff to concentrate on the food preparation and not for all parties straining for what is said.</li><li>The staff is friendly too.</li><li>Great selection of tea and very helpful staff.</li><li>I do n't like to waste time waiting so probably wo n't be back any time soon ( at least till the crowd does down and the staff get quicker).</li><li>But seriously ... get more staff if needed.</li><li>Maybe the staff is still learning the recipes may try one more time and hope things change for the better.</li><li>Delicious food, quick, friendly service; I have n't had any bad experiences with the staff as mentioned in other reviews.</li><li>A pot of tea is served wth each meal and the staff are quite attentive and are happy to take care of their patrons.</li><li>The staff speaks minimal heavy accented English, enough to take your order and any special requests you may have.</li><li>The staff are always very welcoming and hospitable.</li><li>The staff is quite friendly and welcoming.</li><li>Here is some of my favourites: 1) Deep fried chicken wings 2) Chicken with broccoli ( beef with broccoli as well) 3) Sizzling beef ( they do chicken as well) 4) Szechuan beef 5) Crispy Ginger beef 6) Special spicy vermicelli 7) BBQ Spareribs 8) All their fried rice Also if your not sure of what you want to try the staff are very helpful with suggestions and letting you know they best sellers. i give this place two thumbs up !!!:).</li><li>The staff is really friendly and will answer all your questions in regards to the food.</li><li>The staff are really friendly and happy to help me out when i 'm wandering around looking confused ( often).</li><li>On top of everything the staff are very nice and helpful people.</li><li>The staff are really friendly and patiently answered all my questions.</li><li>The staff at this Chatime are just so slow at making drinks.</li><li>This store has a skinny male staff with glasses that needs serious anger management.</li><li>I left a review on the same staff few months ago.</li><li>Chatime needs to know what their staff is doing to their customer is n't simply under-satisfying service.</li><li>The other time one of the staff was smoking at the back and the whole place smelled like cigaret smoke.</li><li>Just like most of the Chatime I am been to, the staff here never looks like they are happy to work here ...</li><li>And some of the staff are touching there heads but not washing there hands after.</li><li>The staff always look so unhappy working there and they are n't very talkative or friendly.</li><li>The staff is always efficient and polite and I 've never had a problem with my order.</li><li>And it does n't help that the staff do n't make drinks quickly.</li><li>Friendly staff.</li><li>Thy always play Mandarin and Taiwanese music, the staff Are not too friendly but they seem efficient.</li><li>Staff were friendly and helpful and the portions are large and filling.</li><li>The staff is extremely friendly and always made sure we were taken care of throughout our stay.</li><li>It is definitely their best dish and the staff will tell you that themselves.</li><li>Friendly staff and delicious pizza, I 'll definitely be coming back for more.</li><li>Staff was friendly and helpful, knew the menu inside out and made me feel confident that my tree nut allergy was being taken seriously.</li><li>We were seated quickly and staff was friendly.</li><li>Nice tasty pasta and pizza. friendly staff.</li><li>My Italian housemate noted that there was not one face, either among the staff of the patrons, that actually looked Italian.</li><li>It 's ok for a bar but if you renovate your pizzarea into a trying to be classy digs then you need to brief your staff on etiquette.</li><li>The staff are very friendly.</li><li>Nice, friendly staff too.</li><li>Also the staff are very friendly.</li><li>The people here really make it shine, great friendly staff have no trouble with dine in or takeout orders and they 're really good about making accommodations and substitutions.</li><li>Nice family owned business with very friendly staff.</li><li>The staff is also very friendly and the service is fast.</li><li>Surprisingly good English by the staff.</li><li>Had 2 staff waiting in the area, and only 3 tables seating at any time.</li><li>Very quiet, calm atmosphere. staff is very nice and attentive.</li><li>Friendly helpful staff.</li><li>When I notified the waiter of this, three staff came out apologizing to me as if it were some international incident between China and Italy.</li><li>Not so good food comparing to price, pizza was soft and dough in the middle and staff are just not ready for the place.</li><li>Service all night was friendly, fast and accurate, and I was very impressed by the efficiency of the staff.</li><li>The staff is friendly, the restaurant is nice, and the food is good too.</li><li>The staff were amazing and so helpful. we went yesterday for dinner and ordered INSALATA CAPRESE and CALAMARI FRITTI and were so good. and for the main course we ordered ORECCHIETTE AROMANTICA and a special dish ( chicken breast stuffed with cheese and spinach and vegetables on the side) and that when it went totally wrong.</li><li>The staff was super friendly and the price was fair for the quality.</li><li>The staff seem nice enough, it 's probably just bad training and bad habits.</li><li>The staff are efficient, friendly and they have never messed up my order.</li><li>The staff are sooo slow and constantly mess up orders.</li><li>Whether I go in the middle of the afternoon, morning, or weekend, the staff seem so confused.</li><li>I do n't know if they are understaffed or that the staff does n't care, but I 've come here in the afternoon and there is no one at the cash.</li><li>I think it 's the kitchen/deli staff that needs management, they distracted our server few times, and than served sandwiches with stale lettuce and tomatoes.</li><li>Right across from Cummer Park (* cough cough* ... phrasing ...), convenient in-and-out, friendly staff, good cheap coffee.</li><li>The staff was friendly but man, I 've learned that you ca n't mess with a Canadian when it comes to their coffee order.</li><li>Friendly staff, stop in for a warm bowl of ash, skewered koobideh and tomatoes grilled over an open fire, jars of pickled vegetables, pomegranates, dates, feta cheese pulses or rice -- this place has it all.</li><li>Which led to an awkward conversation between us and the restaurant staff.</li><li>Friendly staff and welcoming atmosphere.</li><li>The staff seemed nice.</li><li>My friend and i enjoyed our first experience here. the panang curry was amazing. the flavour and spice was delicious. i got the tofu paneng and she got the beef. the service was extremely friendly at the bar as well as the other servers were very bice too. staff was attentive and courteous and i personally enjoyed the atnsoohere. the lights were too dark, and the decor was appropriate. happy to have had my first experience here be a good one.</li><li>Are you not going to tell me that there will be disciplinary action towards your staff member because customer service is something you take pride in ?</li><li>Pros Nice location Ambiance is good Service is fast Friendly staff Good presentation Red curry was on par Cons Dinner for two $ 74 Duck was smoked and dry, gummy Lamb was as dry as it can get.</li><li>Wait staff- this is hit or miss. Do n't get me wrong.</li><li>Pricey, but excellent quality for very good Thai food, I would rate it high quality Thai, beautiful restaraunt, good staff, will eat there again.</li><li>The staff are absolutely fantastic.</li><li>Admirable of him to stick by his staff when she had already told me .... she forgot to place the order ... i sit here now .... writing this review having been to the washroom 3 times in the last 15 minutes ..... my stomach is in absolute agony ....</li><li>Was n't expecting much, but when we walked in we were greeted with such friendly staff.</li><li>The staff did not notify about Any delays and we had to ask the manager to check on the kitchen 3 times.</li><li>We totally forgot and did n't even let the staff know in advance but our waitress was great.</li><li>That was n't enough to endear me --- because there were service issues, and I became sick later that night because the crispy duck was clearly fried in the same oil that shrimp is fried in because staff did n't consider that.</li><li>Pros: Some of the best BBQ pork in town friendly staff Cons: Prices are high compared to other Chinese BBQ places As I said, I do most of my grocery shopping next door so I 'm here on average about once a week.</li><li>The staff here are very friendly.</li><li>Very friendly and courteous staff.</li><li>Makes it really hard for other customers and staff alike.</li><li>Like most Starbucks, they have some friendly staff and quick service.</li><li>The staff here are very nice, they do ask how your day is going which I have yet to experience at other locations.</li><li>The staff was helpful, friendly and cheerful.</li><li>You re coming here for a 5-star experience because every step of the way you 're greeted by lovely staff members, chefs, and customers.</li><li>The staff was friendly, and it 's served cafeteria style, which I did n't mind.</li><li>Staff was friendly.</li><li>Geez, what kind of staff was that.</li><li>Sometimes maybe the staff sucks but the food is heaven, but it did n't happen today.</li><li>We were seated quickly and ordered two bowls of pho. and well ...- the portions were tiny- there was barely any beef in your pho- it is expensive- the pho was n't that good After we paid the bill, the staff never gave us back change.</li><li>The staff and I think the manager looked at me, and began to ask each other questions.</li><li>There is only two seats if you want to try to dine in and there are usually taken up by friends of the staff hanging out 5.</li><li>The staff have all been there since I can remember, definitely over 10 years.</li><li>Great jerk chicken and very friendly staff.</li><li>I love their jerk pork and chicken but the staff fits the name of the establishment, jerk.</li><li>Overall it was a very good experience; modern setup, friendly staff, and a lively atmosphere.</li><li>Staff are nice but very busy so if you ask for something ( more water, drinks etc) just keep reminding them ( yes I know that 's not good service is all about but they do n't mind) ..</li><li>Service: The staff is friendly and the owner is very down to earth.</li><li>The food was quick and the staff were friendly The worst sushi I had was anything to do with salmon.</li><li>Only thing I would recommend to the owner is to have the staff clean the windows and the front glass door.</li><li>The owner and staff are very friendly.</li><li>Their service was excellent, the staff were patient and friendly.</li><li>Fun and friendly staff.</li><li>It was a full house but they needed more staff for the amount of people that were there.</li><li>The people here are completely the worst, I ca n't honestly pick if it 's the staff or the troubled youth that stay here all day.</li><li>Apparently the person who was responsible for making the tamale de pollo has left or something like that but it makes me wonder if it is out of laziness that these other staff members wont make it or that they do n't know how ..</li><li>Very accommodating staff and kitchen.</li><li>The restaurant decor has n't changed in years, but the staff are great and always have a wonderful time !!</li><li>Everyone was friendly ( staff and patrons alike).</li><li>Great managers, poor staff, mediocre good.</li><li>Both times the staff was sitting eating and said today we closed early as its a holiday.</li><li>Friendly staff !!</li><li>My fianc√© and I were impressed by the constant hot, fresh coffee and how friendly the staff were.</li><li>The staff were very efficient, very friendly.</li><li>Staff are always courteous and eager to please.</li><li>We love the ENTIRE staff.</li><li>If you want horrible service, dirty environment and staff who do not care, this is a place for you.</li><li>I feel sorry for some of the staff there I asked if there could be someway we could have more heat and was told the owner wont allow it and I asked arent you gold .. one girl said she is freezing ...</li><li>The staff was pretty nice even though it was close to closing.</li><li>Wait staff does n't acknowledge you ( was n't til 10 minutes later she got our drink order), food came 30 mins after, the server 's excuse was `` we had a lot of chicken wing orders tonight''.</li><li>Maybe a little too laid back because when we walked in, they were so short on staff that we literally stood there for 5 minutes before we were approched.</li><li>Would have loved to have tried the food but the staff need to do better.</li><li>The person up there who manages needs to take into consideration:- Restaurant make-over ( BIG TIME) unless he/she plans to close this business in the next couple of months- Staffing- hello, stop making your staff run around like their heads are cut off.</li><li>Good thing the older staff which was the one that took the call remembered and told us it is okay.</li><li>They really need to hire more staff on the weekends.</li><li>The staff is lovely and the service is flawless.</li><li>The staff here obviously love this place, and it is an institution worth saving.</li><li>Either new staff or owners.</li><li>Excellent food and great staff.</li><li>Staff are always friendly to us and go out of the way to serve us. consistently great chinese food. this restaurant and all their chains are extremely successful. theres always a lineup .. not sure if thats a good thing or bad thing but the food is great so that makes sense. the service is fast and efficient and take out is easy. ill alawys keep coming back here and their practically open all the time. great restaurant hours. the menu is vast and the assortment is amazing.</li><li>When staff asked if we wanted to take it home as it was mainly untouched, we explained it was terrible.</li><li>This place seems to be able to even provide great customer service each time I go, and the staff always seem very friendly.</li><li>The staff just served as normal and the price was reasonable too.</li><li>Having staff that understood English is a major bonus.</li><li>They looked at us like why do you still need it we ( staff) need to clean up for the night!</li><li>My four stars are for the food and 1 star if i could for the staff.</li><li>The staff are young and very professional.</li><li>I would visit the Congee Queen again- the menu is extensive ( much more than congee), the food was prepared with care and the staff were very attentive.</li><li>I pointed it out to the staff ( it was still moving) and he scurried off to get a napkin to ' clean it up'.</li><li>( Wish we had photographed the bugger) Sadly this is the last meal with them, sorry Congee Queen- evidently this is a common occurrence to your staff.</li><li>BTW she looks older than the rest of the staff, wears glasses, rude, yells when she is speaking to you and usually ties her hair in a ponytail.</li><li>The staff are friendly and the prices are fair ( $ 10/person will get you a good meal).</li><li>Friendly and attentive staff.</li><li>Midnight dinner for eight ... and the staff was so helpful in helping us figure out the perfect bubble tea to match our meal.</li><li>If you ask nicely, the staff can sometimes make a recommendation for whatever ails you.</li><li>This little restaurant has really friendly staff.</li><li>If they did I 'm pretty sure my Friend would have started grabbing at the Dak Gal Bee prior to safe edibility while the Staff comes over to check on the doneness or replace the Gas Canister on our Portable Stove.</li><li>First things first, when we walked in, there was a large group waiting to be seated and the staff seemed very unorganized.</li><li>Went so often that one of the staff recognized my kids. unfortunately, this time was n't a good experience.</li><li>In terms of service, the staff are very friendly overall unless it is really busy and hectic they are less attentive.</li><li>The table-top cooking experience was interesting, but the staff are very unobtrusive when they come by to give the ingredients a quick stir and make sure everything is cooking along as it should.</li><li>My friends who have been down to Joon 's on Bloor St. said that the menu here is smaller, however this was a fun restaurant with friendly staff and a cozy atmosphere.</li><li>Our Dak Galbi was cooked at the back and the staff took it out when it was all ready !!!</li><li>I just fear for the servers ' safety when they cook the noodles since the equipment they use to cook the dishes look a bit archaic. i used to go to the one in downtown and this time i thought i will give their yonge location a try !! ordered the chicken dakgalbee with their original joons sauce. and always its a must to add on cheese, ramen and ricecake !!! ( MY FAVVVV !!!) it was a little different as the dakgalbee was now cooked by a staff and brought to you instead of it being cooked right in front of you !! ( there was a little area on one side of the restaurant where a staff is cooking all the dakgalbee orders). i didnt like that as i enjoyed taking part in the cooking process and watching it cooked right in front of me !! the portions did seem smaller and the ramen ended up being overcooked. everything else was ok. maybe its just me but i find the downtown location tasted better!</li><li>I just fear for the servers ' safety when they cook the noodles since the equipment they use to cook the dishes look a bit archaic. i used to go to the one in downtown and this time i thought i will give their yonge location a try !! ordered the chicken dakgalbee with their original joons sauce. and always its a must to add on cheese, ramen and ricecake !!!

Cashier girl.</li><li>For my large size pizza order the staff decided to take a short cut by slicing the eggplant thickly across its centre.</li><li>I felt bad for the staff who must work in such tiny quarters the entire day.</li><li>The entire staff ( cooks and everything) are super efficient.</li><li>The staff really know what they 're doing.</li><li>It ends up being such a mess and the staff have to clean up afterward.</li><li>The staff are relatively friendly but again, do n't expect much because this is more of a take out place.</li><li>The place is small and not have room to sit all the time, but food is great price is more than reasonable and staff are friendly.</li><li>The food is prepared quickly, neatly, nicely, and the staff is friendly.</li><li>The staff is really friendly and REALLY quick.</li><li>The staff are courteous and make your sushi fast without compromising the quality.</li><li>The staff are somewhat friendly, but I would advise making too much chit chat as the place is usually swamped with takeout orders.</li><li>Very tightly packed and the staff working furiously to fulfill orders at shocking speed.</li><li>Service is pretty fast and the staff are friendly.</li><li>I like it inside being so small and cosy I can imagine a place like this in Japan and I enjoyed sitting there listening to the staff talking Japanese.</li><li>I think there is definitely room for improvement with staff and service and I do agree with the comments that the staff 's English is very basic.</li><li>I think there is definitely room for improvement with staff and service and I do agree with the comments that the staff 's English is very basic.</li><li>The staff is friendly and the service is not bad at all.</li><li>Not sure if it was one piece:) Staff is friendly and quick.</li><li>A lot of the time we had to ask them to fill our cups but they only refill half the table ( since it 's a small place w seating of 18 ppl, for some reason 2-3 staff r always standing near the kitchen doing nothing at all).</li><li>Not only will everyone stare at your table, you 'll get extra attentiveness from staff as well ( curiosity, perhaps ?).</li><li>Service is good, the staff is very friendly.</li><li>Wide selection of fresh, high quality fish, beautiful presentation, reasonable prices, friendly staff.</li><li>They 're always really nice here, but I have to say that the attempt to turn this place into more of a restaurant ( staff coming around to take orders, checking in) actually undermines the reason I come here ( to be able to work without interruption).</li><li>They really need to step it up in the food department, but most importantly, they need to consider hiring new, vibrant, efficient staff.</li><li>Floors fairly dirty- not sure why staff kept trampling over spilled food rather than clean it up.</li><li>The staff was friendly, but the service is seriously lacking.</li><li>Antonio, as a manager you should apologize for your staff not being prompt with service.</li><li>The staff here seems overworked and underpaid.</li><li>Overall the service is pretty lousy because the staff is too busy doing nothing and wasting customers time.</li><li>The staff are young and helpful, and the food is just as good as ever.</li><li>It 's obvious to see no one cares about the customer when the `` manager stands around talking and chit chatting as well as staff when people are waiting to be seated.</li><li>The greet staff look like high school drop outs that could n't care less about you, and the bus boys act like they would rather be doing something else.</li><li>The restaurant is welcoming and the staff is top notch.</li><li>I think that since he knows the owner and the staff, we had a good dining experience here.</li><li>The staff were prompt and efficient.</li><li>I agree with other reviewers that the service is not this place 's best attribute, yet the staff is still quite friendly.</li><li>Staff was nice.</li><li>Decor was really really old, signage was out of date and the staff was really rough around the edges.</li><li>However, the staff as eager to answer any questions and offer their suggestions, so even I can make a decision.</li><li>The first member of the staff who took our order was curt, cold and unfriendly and rushed us through without any warmth or a smile of any kind.</li><li>I went to this place on the weekend, the staff is friendly and the food is good.</li><li>Seems the staff is too lazy to even commutate with each other.</li><li>But this mixture of methods, changing it seems during the meal, is annoying as well as leads to long delays and confusion between customers and staff.</li><li>A bit pricey but overall a great dining experience and the staff were very friendly and helpful.</li><li>Initially I subbed it with roasted pepper with dressing on the side- after the staff forgot to leave the dressing the other side, she immediately took back my order and made it from scratch again- second time I also swapped out the lemon ricotta for sweet potato.</li><li>The pizzas are not quite as good as they were nor is that current staff as good as the initial people who were there.</li><li>The staff appear motivated and happy, which makes for a great cafe experience.</li><li>He took it back, the staff apologized and said they 'd get him what he 'd ordered.</li><li>After he came back and sat down, a staff person walked over to our table and said she had punched in the wrong dish and there was a price discrepancy between what he 'd ordered and what he 'd been charged ( the piadina he wanted was a couple of dollars more than the dish he 'd been charged for).</li><li>I 'm surprised the staff chose to address the matter as they did.</li><li>The decor is beautiful and staff are very friendly and willing to accommodate you.</li><li>The staff is really cool.</li><li>The staff are always welcoming and friendly.</li><li>I informed the staff and it took them 10 minutes to get him some.</li><li>What was nice was I also ordered an espresso &amp; the staff waited till lunch was eaten &amp; then delivering my espresso.</li><li>The serving staff who took our order was nice but the lady at the checkout could n't be bothered to tell us the flavors of italian ices!</li><li>One staff was very friendly but the other was easily angered.</li><li>Everytime I come its clear the staff are working very hard, as this place is always packed and they are simply understaffed- Sometimes have to wait ( although well worth it) In this area there are MANY Korean options.</li><li>Try to get to know the staff and they 'll treat you nicer.</li><li>The staff is pretty good about topping up your sides if you ask, minus the pancake ( only one per table).</li><li>Super friendly staff.</li><li>The staff was very nice and the food was amazing!</li><li>They asked for the staff to clear the table but never got around to it ..</li><li>The staff even tried to give us the `` end of meal oranges''.</li><li>The staff can be a little hard to understand if you do n't know Korean, but do speak English.</li><li>The staff was a little slow for a weekday.</li><li>I would give it more stars if the staff had n't ignored us so much.</li><li>However the staff are very friendly:).</li><li>Very friendly staff!</li><li>Pros: No opportunity to experience any Cons: Completely ignored by staff at the door for 10 minutes I was out with a friend looking to grab a bite before the big fight Saturday.</li><li>The staff is very `` cool'', as in really stern and sometimes rushes you to order things but they 're friendly overall. the food served here tastes awful. the place is also pretty much a dump. the service is quite slow.</li><li>The staff are not exactly the friendliest, but who cares!</li><li>* Overall, I WOULD NEVER come back, food is average but SERVICE IS TERRIBLE AND STAFF ARE UNFRIENDLY !!</li><li>I like being greeted by friendly faces, accommodating staff and treated nicely:).</li><li>I went on a week night, and at the start of the evening only one server was taking care of all the tables ( but I was there VERY early, like 4:30pm), but towards the end of our meal a couple more staff were there to help.</li><li>Staff was friendly; tons of side dishes!</li><li>Service: 3/5, typical service- nothing surprising but nice staff overall.</li><li>I 'm not sure whether the owner trains the employee to receive orders this way or the owner has no idea the staff is working like this.</li><li>The food came very quickly, but the staff working there all seemed to be a bit frazzled and inexperienced.</li><li>There is n't enough staff to serve the guests and the AC is way way too cold.</li><li>These newbie ( ish) servers do n't really know what they are doing so their system is very disorganized and lack in staff does n't help the situation as well.</li><li>Service is quick and the staff are quite friendly.</li><li>The staff were very polite.</li><li>The staff is VERY friendly, and very patient with your order.</li><li>I get the sense that the staff really value an all around positive experience for their customers.</li><li>Got some sideways glances fro staff and patrons as I was the only blonde kid there.</li><li>Service is exceptional, staff clearly love working here.</li><li>I love the staff at this place!</li><li>Even though it 's a small space, the staff are cool with lingering and are attentive with refilling water.</li><li>The staff is always changing so there are no familiar faces, but everyone is always really friendly and smiling.</li><li>Staff is helpful, polite and friendly.</li><li>The crepes are neat and nicely presented- you can tell the staff took the time to prepare them, no matter which one you order.</li><li>Really clean and friendly staff.</li><li>The staff is attentive, polite, and service and food came fast.</li><li>He also wanted a refill on his cup of tea ( because they simply brought him a cup with a teabag, but the staff became too busy to help us out.</li><li>Such a nice server and staff.</li><li>Staff were friendly and helpful, seating us as efficiently as they could given that the place was nearly full.</li><li>Very friendly staff, clean restaurant, cozy feel.</li><li>The space is very clean ( they wipe down all the chairs, even the bar where you put your foot!) with very attentive staff.</li><li>They have really good crepes and the staff is super friendly.</li><li>Love this place cause the staff love their job:).</li><li>Have never tried their crapes, though, nor have I dined in there ( always grab their cakes to go), but the staff is always friendly and welcoming.</li><li>Cute little cafe with polite staff.</li><li>Very friendly staff.</li><li>The staff could n't really speak English, which would have been fine except that I only speak English.</li><li>My boyfriend and I spent like an hour and a half there playing cards, despite only ordering two drinks, and we never got any dirty looks from the staff for doing so.</li><li>Before I start talking about the food, this is the cutest place ever*-* it 's not exactly big, but the space is so well decorated, and everything is so pretty and the staff are so nice and ARGH I CAN' T EVEN. anyways. onto the foooood the menu is pretty small, and everything on it is around $ 8-10 dollars.my mom and I split a savoury one first ( mushroom).</li><li>On top of that there is friendly staff and it is an immaculately clean restaurant.</li><li>My experience with this place was HORRIBLE.- arrived on a late holiday Sunday night pretty desperate for food, staff sweeping the floor with dirt and food residues two hours before closing and half the people still eating.</li><li>The chairs were flipped upside down onto table so when the staff put chairs down to sit us, we got concerned and had to clean our own table and utensils.- waitress was VERY rude, she sat us on the inner end of a long table facing a wall where it wAs impossible for my friend to get in and out with people on the outer end.</li><li>The staff are basically the same ones I knew many years ago.</li><li>One of the reasons I loved going here was because the staff were warm helpful.</li><li>I read some of the previous reviews about people inside the kitchen not wearing anything to catch hair ... yesterday I observed the kitchen staff and they were all wearing a mix of either hairnets, caps, and bandanas.</li><li>The staff here cannot comprehend English.</li><li>I 'm pretty sure at a university not too many of the students or staff are really interested in the latest developments of The Young and The Restless so I would pretty much never dine in for that reason.</li><li>Very rude staff I asked for a dessert menu and the lady says to me you need that to know what you want to drink.</li><li>Sticky tables, lack of lighting, lack of staff.</li><li>The staff are also very kind, especially to their regulars.</li><li>The staff is very friendly and helpful especially to their older/elder customers that frequent here.</li><li>Staff is helpful and friendly too.</li><li>The addition of the bar is where we like to sit, and enjoy the conversation with the friendly staff.</li><li>The staff are also very friendly and informative.</li><li>We were seated quickly once we stepped into the restaurant, the staff were friendly and smiled.</li><li>Overall wlddnt come back despite the convenient location and friendly staff.</li><li>Another member of the staff came by to apologize, but was very disappointed with the service.</li><li>The staff are friendly as is the chef.</li><li>Wonderful owners and staff ... really lovely food .. and their spicy edamanme is genius!</li><li>Service was relatively quick, but with only two wait staff it took them a while to serve our entire group of about 10 people.</li><li>- Very friendly staff- as a family-run operation, the owners themselves are almost always working.</li><li>The staff were incredibly friendly and hospitable, offering me a lovely green tea to nurse whilst waiting for my order.</li><li>Worst most dumbest ppl on earth live in this area .... double check ur order ... take a bite infront of them to make sure they do n't mess with the proper ingrediance .... to hell with this BK location I hope they hire less retarded staff who follow direction and do n't mess with orders for the fun of it.</li><li>We ordered Hot Water and Lemon and we needed to remind staff several times.</li><li>Service- 3/5- this is a mom and pop run restaurant but they do n't seem to have enough staff to tend to all of their customers needs and attention.</li><li>Waiters and waitresses did n't really act in a friendly homely way felt like pulling teeth ... not even suggested dishes from staff.</li><li>Friendly staff, were seated immediately.</li><li>Service: If the staff smiled more and were a bit more welcoming when you arrived, it would earn them another star.</li><li>The staff were fine- waitress was quick and polite.</li><li>The staff here are not very friendly and unlike the last review, I found the place outdated and washrooms not very clean.</li><li>Terrible service, unprofessional staff, below par sushi.</li><li>Service is slow because they are lack of staff.</li><li>When I got there staff were advising walk in customers they had an hour to wait and those that managed to get through on the phone were told 2 hours.</li><li>The waitress went to speak to the chef on staff, and came back to tell us that the chef said their fish is very fresh!</li><li>Friendly staff.</li><li>Very large portions, friendly staff.</li><li>I 've been here 40 + times and every time the staff is very pleasant and accommodating.</li><li>Not coming back unless the staff knows how to brighten up.</li><li>The best schwarma ever Must try the chicken on the rocks Reasonable prices Very friendly staff The best option for students at York University looking for a good meal.</li><li>Taste better than St Louis if you ask me ( but similar) staff is relaxed and helpful.</li><li>The staff have been there since for years the service is good they do their very best to make sure that you have a good experience, since its so busy you may have to grab the servers attention.</li><li>The staff there are all friendly and have been there for years.</li><li>The staff seem to be clueless about hygiene and disregard simple procedures like not touching foods with their bare hands after rubbing their fingers on a filthy shop floor.</li><li>The staff here is always friendly and generally run by an older staff that is always on their game.</li><li>The staff here is always friendly and generally run by an older staff that is always on their game.</li><li>Also the staff is really nice.</li><li>Unappreciative staff.</li><li>Maybe if he was there he 'd care more than the staff.</li><li>I mentioned this to the staff and was dismissed.</li><li>Again if the owner was there maybe he 'd care more than his staff.</li><li>Wonderful staff.</li><li>Staff was pretty friendly and did n't find the place noisy as another reviewer posted.</li><li>Staff are extremely friendly and attentive.</li><li>The staff are friendly and treat you like family.</li><li>Aside from their friendly staff, they have GREAT FOOD especially bagoong rice and bangus sisig so delicious !!</li><li>However, the staff are kind, the service is great, and the food is really what you 're there for anyway.</li><li>The young male staff serving me was friendly and had a level of cuteness for `` THOSE'' that are curious.</li><li>A very small menu but the staff were very nice, the food spicy and very delicious.</li><li>Feel like authentic Korean food in which the staff and the patrons are Korean too ?!</li><li>May need to speak to the staff if you do want to park in the back though!</li><li>The process here is fast, and the staff know how busy they get and do n't wait for you to waffle between options- probably why the menu is smaller to limit the need for debate, and if you ca n't decide between two options either order them both or come back again.</li><li>Also- staff are always friendly and polite.</li><li>I went today with my daughter the location was easy to find and the staff was very friendly.</li><li>I would have preferred pork bone soup: ( Service &amp; staff are friendly and fast, price is right, but I think I 'm going to continue my journey to search for an even better place.</li><li>And the service is always excellent, very friendly staff at both locations.</li><li>Friendly staff, just wished the dining tables were n't placed so close to each other.</li><li>Taste was great, staff were polite, facilities were clean ...</li><li>The staff was very friendly and fast to respond.</li><li>We told the wait staff immediately and they just said, `` oh ... sorry''.</li><li>Staff look unhappy and not welcoming at all.</li><li>They brought cold and old dragon rolls California rolls were old staff was super rude and Bill was astronomical.</li><li>Heres the breakdown: The staff attending to us was not friendly, anything we ordered he would be rude and tell us they dont have anymore. for example ... soup of the day ? no ... hamachi neck ? no ... hot and sour soup ? no .... beef skewer ? ... no ... mango yogurt for dessert ? no ....</li><li>Staff could put more effort into explaining how the AYCE process works.</li><li>Also, too much hustle and bustle with cooking staff running back and forth excuse me excuse me trying to get past you, etc.</li><li>The food has gotten better along with the staff as the place has grown over the years.</li><li>Fun, nice staff, nice decor.</li><li>Seems like the restaurant staff cannot handle the traffic during dinner.</li><li>Service was good, friendly staff.</li><li>It 's pretty good ... staff is usually very nice and the food is definitely consistent.</li><li>The service is always quick, the staff are always friendly and the food is always fresh and delicious.</li><li>I think they need to work on the quality of the food, the length of time they keep it on the line for serving, and the general attitude of the staff.</li><li>Not the warmest reception for newbies with questions but the staff seem to treat the regulars well.</li><li>The staff were so kind, sweet and helpful, and the food is home-cooked Italian!</li><li>Most recent visit, I was with about 10 other people and we were there from 7 to almost 11pm, which was fine, but you can tell the staff did n't want to be there.</li><li>There also did n't seem to be enough staff as there was nobody manning the coffee station ( the most obvious thing for that time of night) and the two ladies doing the crepes looked overworked and totally unenthusiastic.</li><li>As you are purchasing a meal, the staff will load the cost on your card which you pay for on your way out.</li><li>The staff look tired and not interested in working there.</li><li>However, services is superb all staff are very nice.</li><li>Prices are outrageous, staff are rude, except for nice hostesses, and best food is the squash soup, chicken and Caesar salads.</li><li>I visited today with my family we really enjoy the food and the staff is really friendly.</li><li>Sat on the patio which was pretty nice, but had really poor quality food and was basically ignored by the staff.</li><li>Overall a great experience. i was sooo offended. as the manager of a bar, i understand some things take time, but being rudely greeted by the bar staff and ignored for 10 minutes while they do nothing is pretty bad to begin. having the barstaff whispering to each other while blatantly pointing at my friend is obscene. we asked to move to a table. they said fine, no one brought us menus or asked us if we wanted drinks. the bitchy blond bartender walked right by the table 4 times, making a point of not looking at us and cleaning tables right next to ours, yet still ignoring us. then she walked to the edge of the bar and twirled her hair for a bit, all the while making sure not to make eye contact with us. we finally went over to the bar and asked the guy if we could get menus or drinks or service, explaining to him that we have been waiting for ten minutes, when he rudely informed me that i had only been waiting 20 seconds. so i asked for the bill from our drink at the bar, had my tip rudely returned to me, amid more whispering and pointing at us. im disgusted and quite upset about being treated like that, especially because i used to be quite a regular there, and im a big tipper and very polite ( dont forget i manage a bar, and it should be all about customer service). i wouldnt recomend this place to anybody for any reason. maybe a different location, not this one.</li><li>Took forever to be seated, the staff were not at all friendly or interested in providing a good experience, and the food was not good.</li><li>The staff can be accommodating to your party, provided you are reasonable and give them ample time.</li><li>I understand that they use the carts to be more efficient but you should train your staff to know that customers do not appreciate scolding hot soup being swung in their direction.</li><li>I can see the staff cooking and preparing the food which they should be more careful.</li><li>I 'd definitely come back, the place is nice and cozy and the staff are polite.</li><li>The staff was even kind enough to assist us when we ordered an item that nobody knew how to cook!</li><li>The new waiting staff is SO RACIST !!!!!</li><li>The entire new waiting staff is extremely racist.</li><li>What happened to the old staff ?</li><li>Service: The staff were quite friendly, and the service was pretty speedy and efficient.</li><li>Blood sausage, meh not so much .../ storytime From the 1st time I 've come here to the previous time ( it 's all a blur ...), I will always remember the ultra busy staff who will try to accommodate you IF they have the chance.</li><li>Overall experience was an epic fail, from their un welcoming staff, there 's this old lady that was very rude, she did even bother to greet, their place is a mess, it stinks and their food is over priced compare to other korean restaurants thats clean, cozy and accomodating ..</li><li>I 'm going to put the same amount of energy and thought into writing this review as they did preparing my meal.- horrible attitude from the staff team, not a single trace of politeness ( slams menu on the table, rude comments and demeanor, etc)- dish came in a dirty bowl- was the standard for hygiene this low ? ( See picture below)- dish had a distinct taste of cigarette ash- I paid in cash and before I was able to collect my change, the waitress tried to take the money away and asked ( still rudely) if I was going to leave her a 40% tip.</li><li>We were greeted by friendly staff.</li><li>The staff are extreamly friendly, and get the orders out pretty quick!</li><li>I 'm giving this place a 5-star for having very patient and accommodating staff on top of great food.</li><li>I applaud the staff for being so patient.</li><li>Five stars for patient, hard-working staff and excellent food.</li><li>They seemed to be under staff with an older man and woman ( possibly the owners).</li><li>Food is great and staff is amazing, he works his butt off!</li><li>I 'll leave this at 5 stars for its staff and hot piping burger.</li><li>The staff are friendly and the food comes out quick and hot like most other pho restaurants.</li><li>The staff are friendly and the prices are pretty good for the portions they give you.</li><li>Good thing I understood a bit of vietnamese because i over heard them telling to the rest of the staff loudly that `` this guy did not bring cash'' ... and `` Chuh oy he should be more prepared'' ... how the F*! # was i supposed to know they took cash only if they did n't even display a sign about it.</li><li>Also, the staff were friendly, the service was great and once ordered the food came out really quickly!</li><li>A group of staff then sat around drying all the utensils with dish towels.</li><li>There dill sauce is amazing with the fries !! this place is terrible !!! the service sucks, and the staff and `` management'' are rude! it took the waitress 15 minutes to come and check on us. when we asked for a drink, she just never came back so we had to make our way to the bar ourselves.</li><li>The kitchen staff would skin the duck in front of you, its a show you do not want to miss. Then of course once it is skin, ask them to use the leftovers to make a lettuce wrap.</li><li>The service was horrible as well, all new staff.</li><li>A nice restaurant, food is great but a bit noisy, the staff tried hard to please our group of ten and genuinely met our expectation.</li><li>The staff does not speak good english so expect to be frustrated as they look clueless when you ask about the menu.</li><li>The staff bearly speak english and they will keep you waiting and bring you the wrong order.</li><li>I tried to do take out here to avoid the sloppiness of the staff 's customer service, but each time i take out i do not get what i order or the food depreciate in taste and quality.</li><li>Service was really good, staff was helpful and attentive.</li><li>Good service and staff !!!</li><li>The staff work quick to get the food and I like sitting in the quiet environment.</li><li>The new staff appears preoccupied with other matters and not caring much of the quality of service.</li><li>The staff is ok and were polite to me.</li><li>The place looks like a dump, the staff looks like they are freshly paroled from prison, and the sausage sandwich was completely unimpressive, but that 's no matter, because the hot veal sandwich with cheese is still excellent, and well worth the trip.</li><li>Friendly staff is accompanied by amazing food and great prices.</li><li>If nothing else the staff are extremely friendly and personable!</li><li>Although all the staff are friendly, she 's always there for her customers.</li><li>Some of the other staff take forever to get to you, and you may end up having quite a wait before even placing an order, but never with Alina:).</li><li>After experiencing poor service and avg food on more than one occasion, and witnessing and hearing about how terrible they treat their staff, Ill take my business else where.</li><li>It was the end of the night and I guess they do n't have a staff area out of sight because they were all just chillin and chattin in the corner.</li><li>Other staff member stands by waiting for the plates, and does n't look shocked at all at this ( so I guess this is standard/acceptable behavior there)!</li><li>The staff is much better than the other location in my opinion.</li><li>Customers struck up conversations with the staff like they 've been doing it for years.</li><li>The staff is always friendly, and the restaurant is clean, but I found the food very greasy and unapeeling.</li><li>The staff is polite and friendly, but they 're understaffed for the weekend rush.</li><li>It took us a while to get our bill, and the staff apologized for the wait.</li><li>Great food, great staff, and most of all great prices.</li><li>Everyone else is raving about the staff being so nice there really was n't anything spectacular.</li><li>Delicious does not consider the ambiance of the restaurant, the level of service from the staff or the prices.</li><li>Friendly staff and tasty sandwiches.</li><li>The staff are consistently miserable and rude and they only accept cash.</li><li>I will say, though, that the staff were very friendly.</li><li>Back then Staff was rude, service non existent.</li><li>They must have had a good turnaround the new staff were much better.</li><li>The staff is very friendly and the food is very yummy and big portions.</li><li>The only big plus is the staff, who are hardworking and take their job seriously.</li><li>The staff is miserable and unprofessional with no greeting at the door, with us having to fetch a Member to be seated, to the moment you pay and leave, they have such hatred for simply existing there, it will certainly make the customer run for the door or shall I say next door!</li><li>We were completely drawn back by the rude staff, as soon as we entered.</li><li>Not only have I tried ordering from the gluten sensitive page, she was not able to confirm or the knowledge that the staff and the kitchen are prepared and/or trained as they should be to prepare the food properly and check the ingredients in certain premade items such as bacon.</li><li>Mind you: I have eaten from other locations, there should not be such an issue where I am so put on the spot and and later talked about with other staff and got embarrassing looks from all the members.</li><li>I would strongly recommend some proper training, not only in food safety, customer service, but also proper interviewing would help, before hiring a bunch of dead beat miserable, un knowledgable ' staff' and out the rest in the back to take out the trash!</li><li>In addition, there was a staff member ( waitress maybe ?</li><li>I 'm not sure if she was eating guests food or a snack of her own, but staff should never be eating like this in front of guests.</li><li>The restaurant has amazing staff, but a rude and careless manager.</li><li>Also, this is a great place to celebrate a birthday since the staff sings and hands out a mini fruit sculpture dessert to the birthday boy or girl.</li><li>Cora 's has a very bright and welcoming atmosphere and the staff are extremely friendly, creating a sense of belonging to those who visit.</li><li>I 'd have to say I like the staff here better.</li><li>The staff is n't very friendly but whatever I just wanted to get in and out.</li><li>Tip #1- The service bell can be HEARD by everyone in the restaurant except for the staff working here.</li><li>Otherwise, I was quite impressed that the lady staff speak English, Korean and even Mandarin.</li><li>They are always under staff, so the staff are n't necessary the friendliest.</li><li>They are always under staff, so the staff are n't necessary the friendliest.</li><li>At best their service is decent but at worst ( and this is often) the staff is rude and the owners alike.</li><li>It took awhile to be seated when there were empty but uncleaned tables), they did n't come by when I rang the bell several times, but I think it was because they did n't have enough staff.</li><li>Customer service was good and the staff were friendly.</li><li>Anyway, the staff was attentive and friendly.</li><li>The downside about this place is the staff.</li><li>Despite being `` fast food'', if you eat in, the staff will bring you your order and check in once in a while to see how you 're doing.</li><li>After waiting another 20 minutes, it still had not come out and I had finished my food already ( which was not great by the way-lentil soup had no flavour and was room temp) They had forgotten to make his falafel laffa-which is baffling since there were at least 12-15 staff members working.</li><li>The staff and owner are completely incompetent and like they have no interest in doing much of anything.</li><li>First time trying this place and right away I was turned off by the staff.</li><li>The staff tried to tell me it it was going to cost 99 cents.</li><li>The staff do n't look too experienced either.</li><li>Trying to add some avocado and hot peppers to my salad seemed like a complex production with the staff worried about breaking `` franchise rules''.</li><li>Although the line ups were there the staff were able to keep the line moving and serve everyone efficiently, that the line seemed to be constantly moving forward and the wait was really not an issue and lasted no more than 10-12 minutes.</li><li>What really caught my attention though was how several of the staff went the extra mile to make sure my grandma and elderly aunt who were with me felt comfortable and welcomed.</li><li>Highly recommended, good staff, quick service, good food.</li><li>I 've been to this location several times and love the food but I have an issue with the staff.</li><li>There is a lady at the cash ( do n't know her name but she is blond), she is extremely rude to the other staff.</li><li>I took it from the couple ( who were not upset) and then proceeded to return the coaster/pager to your staff members and explained that they made a mistake and walked away.</li><li>Nice staff.</li><li>Anyway, nice atmosphere, good food and awesome staff!</li><li>When we asked the staff for help for how much food we should get, they provided us with terrible advice with proportions way off from what was realistically feasible to eat to get us to pay more money.</li><li>I 've never had a problem with the staff or food.</li><li>The staff seem very eager to please- they gave me extra premium toppings due to a slight mix-up ... so now I 'm a big fan of the smoked cheddar cheese.</li><li>The staff inside are easy to deal with.</li><li>The staff is always very friendly- quick to seat me and explains any menu items I ask about.</li><li>Very satisfying. satay on the road has been one of my family 's favorite restaurants since i was a kid. i remember coming here when i was ten and ordering the same thing that i get now, ten years later: cashew nut chicken with an order of steamed rice and the shrimp chips with peanut sauce. first of all, the food tastes delicious. i think there 's been one or two times out of the hundreds of visits to this place where the food tasted a little spicier than usual but other than that, it 's been consistently amazing for close to a decade. i 've had cashew nut chicken at other thai restaurants and it just does n't compare. i ca n't speak about most of their other food but from what i 've experienced they 've been by far the best tasting thai restaurant in and around toronto. the wait staff is quick and friendly for the most part which is great. the atmosphere of the restaurant is nice ... they just re-did it and although i have to say i prefer the original decor which had an authentic thai feel to it, their modern, contemporary approach to their new `` look'' is very pleasing to the eyes and enjoyable to dine at as well. the value of the food is great. my girlfriend and i come here for their lunch special almost every week at least once and have a full meal with a drink that leaves us satisfied for both taste and hunger for usually under $ 10, 15% tip included. how can you beat that ? really. not to mention, you can order shrimp chips and peanut sauce as an appetizer while you wait for your meal, at no charge. i have yet to find another thai restaurant in toronto that has that. five stars to my favorite thai place since i was ten. i was happy to see that they expanded and opened another store on bayview. good for them!</li><li>The staff are friendly.</li><li>The staff there all seemed miserable and reluctant to serve the patrons.</li><li>However the surly nature of th staff and the `` WOW, locked in the early eighties decor'' was a bit off putting.</li><li>Over the past three years, they 've been through a renovation, but the food quality and the staff has remained the same.</li><li>The food is always fresh, and the staff are always friendly.</li><li>He service is great and the staff is nice.</li><li>Staff were attentive and folksy.</li><li>Service is a bit hit or miss; the staff is pleasant, but this restaurant appears to be a small, possibly family-run business so staff sometimes gets overwhelmed.</li><li>Service is a bit hit or miss; the staff is pleasant, but this restaurant appears to be a small, possibly family-run business so staff sometimes gets overwhelmed.</li><li>The staff is rude.</li><li>Staff was attentive, available, and did n't hover.</li><li>Very difficult to get the attention of the staff.</li><li>There 's one woman who 's very friendly, but I ca n't say the same about the rest of the staff.</li><li>It 's a very small place but has a nice mom &amp; pop feel to it, you can tell immediately that this is a `` neighbourhood spot'' and the staff pretty much knew most of the customers dining in there by name.</li><li>The service from all the female staff is excellent, but do n't expect a smile from the owner.</li><li>The staff was so friendly and helpful, they let me customize my pizza and it was prepared quickly.</li><li>There are several Teppanyaki restaurants in the area now ( two very close on Don Mills Road), and while most of the staff working in them are Chinese, and the food probably not quite as high quality, they are busy, and the overall experience is great.</li><li>Best service and friendly staff and the food was very delicious.</li><li>The hostess ladies and staff were very friendly and nice.</li><li>The staff were all very friendly and I had no trouble whatsoever while I was there.</li><li>Too busy chatting away for the staff to do any quality control and make sure what we order is what we get.</li><li>Their staff obviously is more interested in themselves than anything else.</li><li>The portion sizes are good as well, but here 's the problem ... staff is unfriendly.</li><li>It may not be 100% authentic Filipino food, but it 's still close ( maybe it has a bit of Chinese influence, but it 's still awesome) The staff are friendly whenever I visit, but I have n't really seen any rude workers like mentioned in a few reviews.</li><li>But recently they have changed management and staff and have to say I am incredibly disappointed with the service.</li><li>The staff was very nice at the takeout section.</li><li>Besides that, the food was quick, the food was fresh and the staff were friendly.</li><li>The service was soooo slow, impolite staff, and the food was uncooked.</li><li>Maybe get your communication between staff members in check ?</li><li>My husband ordered the mushroom Swiss burger and after his first bite he could tell it was made from a frozen burger patty ( which one of the staff members confirm).</li><li>I went with a group of friends and we definitely overstayed our welcome by sitting and drinking water for an hour after we finished eating but the staff was sweet enough and only gave us the nudge when there was a line forming for seats.</li><li>I do recommend it for it 's excellent hours and solid staff but if you 're looking for mind blowing food then head elsewhere.</li><li>The staff are great, polite and friendly.</li><li>Shortly after finishing our meals, one of the staff members ( not our original server ?) lets us know that they were having a promo: cake was 2 slices for the price of 1.</li><li>+ The staff was quite attentive during our early morning Sunday brunch.</li><li>The place did n't look too crowded at the time we arrived however I found it took a little while for the staff to notice us and seat us.</li><li>We waited about 10 minutes to be seated on the patio while three staff members stood in front of us talking.</li><li>Went there for breakfast today, it was nearly empty because of the timing, but the staff was very friendly and the atmosphere of the place was really calm and perfect for breakfast.</li><li>The staff is here is alright; not the most attentive.</li><li>He was actually the manager, and one of his staff apparently did n't show up for work that morning.</li><li>I took it to work with me and shared it with 3 other staff members.</li><li>The staff here are super nice. &amp; the food is pretty affordable.</li><li>The prices are decent and all the staff were nice.</li><li>A few things happened that made me questions the professionalism of the staff: 1) The mug my coffee was served in looked like it have been rubbed against the hood fan in the kitchen before being served.</li><li>The staff were friendly and personable.</li><li>Amazing Service and Amazing staff Great setting, great everything, I 've only been once, but I can already say that we will be frequenting this spot as often as we can!</li><li>The staff were very nice, the service was great. i had icecream parfait and it was nothing special.</li><li>Great restaurant, friendly staff and amazing food!</li><li>The food is like any other Mc Donalds and the staff cam be quite rude.</li><li>The staff was very courteous and I like the atmosphere, but the food left something to be desired.</li><li>The staff was friendly and quick to take your order, however once your food is served you wo n't see your server again until you are done your meal.</li><li>There 's lots of staff around, but I find that they need more experience and trained.</li><li>On top of the above, attitudes here by staff leaves a lot to be desired.</li><li>Asian staff.</li><li>The staff here are really friendly and I love the ambience.</li><li>It 's a very small place, the decor is welcoming and the staff very attentive.</li><li>The food is amazing and fresh and the staff is great.</li><li>The food is good but not worth it as the culture of the managing staff is not generous.</li><li>Staff is unpleasant service is slow and they never offer compliments for waiting customers Too be because the food is actually good.</li><li>Meanwhile, poor girl number three is walking around in circles, in what I presumed to be, the only way someone can get a hold of staff without walking up to the bar, ripping the cellphone out of their hands and smashing it into the ground.</li><li>Other than that, the staff were friendly and greeted us and seated us quickly even on a busy evening.</li><li>Sports pub vibe, large screen TV 's, friendly staff and speedy service.</li><li>The staff here is great, fast and super friendly, I officially love them all.</li><li>You need better trained staff who at least have basic common courtesy and a brain.</li><li>At least one can fall back on the fact that all the staff here were Chinese.</li><li>I should have probably read the reviews on yelp before going to the restaurant .. but I did n't .. .. btw before i get started why is there filtered reviews ? maybe i missed something ..; anyways went here for lunch with a co-worker because its close to the office .. the decor is okay and we were quickly seated but thats as good as it got .. none of the staff make eye contact, everything is slow even tho the establishment was n't busy, there was just no importance on quality .. we ordered one of the lunch specials, the pricing is good, but I learned a long time ago, you get what you pay for, so for $ 7 to $ 15 you can get a salad, appetizer, sushi, chicken/beef, dessert, etc the food was cold and really average, they forgot our sushi and when we pointed it out to the manager he said he would take it off our bill .. a whole $ 1.20 ?? for 6 sushi rolls .. like i said u get what u pay for .. my co-worker, who is from hong kong blasted the manager, but he was no help ... so i will never go back .. but the experience got me back to using yelp!;).</li><li>It sad when staff do n't care about the quality of their service and it reflects badly on the restaurant.</li><li>I found the staff were just fine but perhaps I had lower expectations.</li><li>I do n't think the staff were super friendly like you would see at a Jack Astors or Boston Pizza, but then again it 's an Asian restaurant that would n't have that kind of vibe anyways.</li><li>Some of the staff here were friendly, others were rude.</li><li>Last time we visited was a few months back and we saw some of the kitchen staff napping in the closed off sections of the restaurant.</li><li>Astonishingly rude staff ( especially female front hostess), mediocre food, decent prices.</li><li>The food always comes quick and the staff is always friendly.</li><li>Some staff are nice, some not so much.</li><li>My review is based on new staff.</li><li>No matter how busy it is, the staff will do anything in their power for food to come out in time.</li><li>I have been here twice and each time I had a good experience with the staff and food.</li><li>The chatter by the staff should have been had after their shift.</li><li>Decent food, friendly staff and cool atmosphere.</li><li>The staff is friendly and the food is fantastic. i try and have all my business functions here because they always make me look good.</li><li>Prices are a lot higher than you 're average steakhouse but you can definitely expect professionalism from the staff and your steak to be cooked to perfection.</li><li>Once you make your way into the restaurant, almost immediately you 'll be greeted by some friendly staff members, which is nice to have someone acknowledge you upon your arrival.</li><li>As this was a surprise birthday dinner, at the end of my meal, the staff brought out a piece of cheesecake with a lit candle ( no singing involved thank you very much).</li><li>Pleasant staff.</li><li>Since my DC knew all the staff ( they are Greek, naturally) we were seated in a prime spot next to a giant roaring fireplace.</li><li>When I brought it to the attention of the staff, I was told that I was wrong and that the steak was indeed medium rare.</li><li>I will say the staff were very friendly, if they can improve the food quality, this would be a great dining experience.</li><li>The staff were polite and were able to make us feel welcomed to such a matured high end atmosphere.</li><li>All I heard was dishes clashing people running up and down the stairs the manager giving staff crap.</li><li>There is a fantastic wine list and the staff is very knowledgeable about the wine.</li><li>The staff was perfect.</li><li>Staff are all highly professional and take great pride in their ability to make sound recommendations and light desserts on fire without batting an eye.</li><li>Great atmosphere and friendly staff.</li><li>The staff are very friendly.</li><li>Not much to comment about the staff because you just press a button and they come to your table!</li><li>- Staff were friendly and accommodating.</li><li>Me listing out these `` moments'' is not here to punish the staff that work here but to merely bring out the point that, good food is not sufficient for a successful restaurant.</li><li>Staff were friendly and attentive.</li><li>Let the staff know it 's your birthday and they will give you a slice of cake while music plays in the background.</li><li>The staff were also very efficient when we were there.</li><li>My suggestion to the staff who took the photo, if you are n't sure whether it was a good quality photo, DO IT AGAIN.</li><li>Staff was very helpful.</li><li>I strongly feel that if people did n't tip out of obligation then waiting staff would get the message and improve.</li><li>Also thanks to the staff for doing the birthday cake and complimentary picture for my brother on his birthday.</li><li>The service was ok ... it looked like they hired a lot of new people ( they had Trainee badges on) and were always accompanied by a trained staff ( I have never seen that before so it shows the restaurant wants to make sure the service is good).</li><li>I tried to do it to a few other veggies, but the staff started to murmur around me to each other.</li><li>One of the staff was helpful in explaining the sauces, depending on what flavour we wanted.</li><li>The staff is very attentive.</li><li>However after they took my order, the staff came back twice telling me that they ran out of ingredients for two dishes I ordered.</li><li>The service here among the most efficient in any Chinese restaurant, and the staff are as professional as they come.</li><li>Do n't make customers wait if your tables are ready and empty and your staff are doing nothing. my go to place with my family !!!! portions are huge, not only do we get super full, we always end up taking left overs home because we could n't finish it.</li><li>Some of the staff do n't speak English well, so they would mess up the order when we ask for modifications.</li><li>The staff are reasonably attentive, although it can get pretty busy.</li><li>The staff is quick and the food comes out quick.</li><li>I 'm not sure if they 've changed around the cooking staff but the food has gotten better!</li><li>However, I do appreciate that their food is not too oily or salty!- other pros: LARGE portions, large variety of congee and noodles, friendly staff- con: can become very crowded: ( side dishes I 've tried and liked: tofu and garoupa, house special chicken, mushroom and beef, tofu and mixed veggie congees I 've tried and liked: mixed vegetable and sweetcorn, sweetcorn and beancurd. congees I 've tried and disliked: sliced fish congee tastes bland ....</li><li>The staff that was there for yrs are all gone and they must have changed cooks as well.</li><li>But I was far more agitated by the indifference and total lack of urgency by the staff to make any gesture of compensation.</li><li>We could n't finish them all so I brought it in to work and gave it to my staff.</li><li>The service here is usually good and the staff are really friendly.</li><li>The staff behind the counter saw us but did not come to seat us.</li><li>The staff did not seem to care about their lack of service, nor did management.</li><li>To the management staff of Maxim, I hope you do read this review and resolve this issue with your staff, because you should know you are not the only bakery/cafe in the area, and at this rate, it wo n't matter if your meringue cakes are good.</li><li>To the management staff of Maxim, I hope you do read this review and resolve this issue with your staff, because you should know you are not the only bakery/cafe in the area, and at this rate, it wo n't matter if your meringue cakes are good.</li><li>The staff here has a VERY authentic HK ( Hong Kong) charm and customer service.</li><li>The staff were kind and they were all guys too. ( just an observation) I had the Soup of the Day, which was creamy spinach.</li><li>You can see exactly what they have for the day but if you want to buy any, the staff have to pack that for you.</li><li>Lovely staff who are passionate and the food is just right -- comforting and filling.</li><li>As we walked out, we may of just been invisible because all the staff at the front of the restaurant never thanked us for coming either.</li><li>The staff are pretty nice and it basically saves this place from getting a 2 star rating.</li><li>Very friendly staff.</li><li>While I was there, one of his staff members ( I assume was new) was pretty clueless and took forever and was very unsure of what he was doing.</li><li>There are a few new servers that I 've seen use the same gloves on the cash register and then go back to making sandwiches but the more senior staff, when present, always makes a point to remind them to put on a new pair.</li><li>Good food and reasonable price, very friendly staff and caring owners.</li><li>However, once you venture into the place, you will notice the welcoming staff and family feel to it, as well as spot about 6-8 tables hidden in the back.</li><li>Service was quick, staff was friendly and food was delicious.</li><li>Family place with friendly staff.</li><li>Very nice and courteous staff.</li><li>Friendly staff, great portion size.</li><li>Ordered over-medium once and received over easy, which was unappetising and went uneaten. ... love this mom and pops place! the staff is quite friendly and the owner always greets us personally whenever he 's around. i have personally only ever ordered from their all day breakfast menu so i ca n't speak for their lunch and dinner but it is the best breakfast at the most decent price. while i have ordered many breakfast dishes, my favorite go-to is the eggs benedict with smoked salmon and asparagus. i must have had this dish once a week for the past year and it 's been cooked to perfection every time. the sauce is not too heavy, not too light. the eggs are always made the way you like it- i make sure i get them to soft poach them. home fries are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. weekend mornings and brunch time get pretty busy but it is always worth the wait:).</li><li>Great restaurant with friendly, attentive staff and a warm, welcoming environment.</li><li>Delicious food and wonderful staff.</li><li>Service is slow here, but the staff has always been very warm and friendly.</li><li>Korean staff and chef.</li><li>The staff was unenthused and the tables are wobbly and dirty.</li><li>While the staff is friendly and the ingredients fresh, it 's nothing out of this world.</li><li>Fresh food, friendly old-school greek counter staff always up for a Leafs or Jays chat, and open past 2:30 a.m. Mon-Sat.</li><li>Very friendly staff.</li><li>- Friendly staff.</li><li>For example staff need to announce or post signage indicating that they now accept `` debit'' as a MOP.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
