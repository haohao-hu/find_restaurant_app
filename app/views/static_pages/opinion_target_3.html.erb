<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 3' %><h2>place<br />occurrence: 1686</h2><div><ol><li>This place is located in the dufferin/steeles plaza with the shoppers.</li><li>If you want authentic ingredients this is the place to shop and you will enjoy the experience. this place has been around for a while. we used to go to the one in montreal, and now that they have one in toronto, i 'm very happy! this is purely a turkish imports store. and they do a great job at that. it 's all the tastes i grew up with. both sucuk and pastirma are delicious. so are the cheeses. however they are a little on the pricey side. if you 're looking for authentic turkish ingredients, this is your place.</li><li>Just took a Turkish friend of mine to this nice, clean well-run place.</li><li>Lunch will usually cost an average of $ 10 or more but this place is usually always consistent!</li><li>Good dim sum place, clean but small.</li><li>I wanted to like this place because it 's close by and convenient however unfortunately I did not, I got take out so maybe dinning in is better.</li><li>This place is a great lunch spot!</li><li>The place looked like a damp, dirty tables food leftovers everywhere.</li><li>The place is tidy but in a really worn out, tired looking building desperately in need of renovations, so this factor adds some grungyness.</li><li>This place is literally a hole in the wall type-of-joint.</li><li>The overall presentation was not up to par, however KEEP in mind this is n't a fancy place ...</li><li>THIS place is actually the WORST food establishment I have ever had the displeasure of going to.</li><li>The food is PRICEY, it is absolute CRAP, and it should be illegal for such a place to exist.</li><li>Great place to come with friends have some middle eastern food, smoke some sesha not really sure how to spell it.</li><li>The tables were a little sticky and the place could use a bit of renovation.</li><li>This place is very casual, good to chill with friends or coworkers or in general a good inexpensive sushi place.</li><li>So I walked into this place to order a takeout.</li><li>The place itself was pretty basic holding maybe 40 people at most.</li><li>Also, unfortunately, this place only accepts cash.</li><li>This place is capable of producing the same variety of drinks and food as Destiny 's tea shoppe, and that 's rather impressive for such a humble space which used to be a cracked out Coffee Time.</li><li>And that basically sums up this place.</li><li>Overall, I 'm not a fan of this place- probably would not go back unless someone wanted to try it for the first time.</li><li>I 'm so sad, I used to love this place.</li><li>This place is just ok overall, although drinks are generally impressive, food is also not bad, but service-wise, it fails!</li><li>I 'm surprised at how badly review this place, i personally like it for several reasons.</li><li>Love love this place!</li><li>This place is fairly large and busy.</li><li>I come to this place and I can say it is the worst food place I have been in Toronto.</li><li>It is a bad joke that I hope you never visit to or at leadt I would like this place to shut down.</li><li>This place is fancier than the usual second cups I have been to.</li><li>This place is yet another reason for me to bring my own lunch.</li><li>The place is big and nice.</li><li>I absolutely love this place.</li><li>The place is strictly takeout ( though the guy asked me if it was for here.</li><li>The place is tiny so know that if you 're looking for a place to eat.</li><li>Lovely decor, comfortable seating, great for groups ( remember to make a reservation if you 're going at lunch time, this place gets busy)!</li><li>Service was very prompt but the pressure to move on was clear once the place filled up.</li><li>This place is fairly big for a congee hole, however, its very much dated, and everything in here is a tad worn.</li><li>Idk why people giving this place higher stars since the food is blend and the service is extremely bad.</li><li>This is one of he good place I like.</li><li>Admittedly, this is n't the best sushi place, but the quality-to-price ratio exceeded all expectations.</li><li>Place were clean even during morning rush.</li><li>This place is always empty or near empty every time I walk by and it 's for a reason.</li><li>A balanced meal this is not, but next time I want something cheap in the neighbourhood that is n't a pizza or corned beef, I 'll check this place out again.</li><li>The place is very old and grimy, the food is basically tasteless and dry.</li><li>This place is being sold, I guess the neighbourhood finally decided they do n't need a dirty and mediocre cafe where something else better could be.</li><li>The place is very small and located in a end of a circular driveway of the NorthTown.</li><li>This small place serves Japanese/ Korean food.</li><li>The place is tiny with about 5 tables.</li><li>There 's a great Columbian place that makes delicious cheese balls and stuffed pig.</li><li>The only underperformer I 've found so far is the roti place, but overall it 's the perfect place to go if you want some tasty but cheap food.</li><li>The place is definitely very dated and run-down, with very minimal service, but the food is actually quite good and the price is even better.</li><li>Mother thought we should check this place out, to give a place a chance without looking up reviews.</li><li>The place can seat a good number of people.</li><li>Hopefully it was just the night, b/c this place WAS among my top-five in North York.</li><li>There really was n't anything special about the place, but I will continue to be that odd individual who walks in, ignores everything else, and buys chicken skewers.</li><li>The place looks like it could 've been upscale back in the 80 's but is seriously flawed in it 's decor.</li><li>Ugh, this place just made me frustrated.</li><li>I simply love this place.</li><li>So, if you are having the munchies and are in the Bathurst and Wilson area, this place will do.</li><li>I am very disappointed, this place has been around forever.</li><li>This place is definitely not kosher.</li><li>The place was bright and clean.</li><li>If your craving for ice cap at night and your in the area, this is the place to go.</li><li>This place is normally the usual weekly takeout as its healthier than most fast food.</li><li>I was greeted by the cute waitress ( I should mention, this place had always had very attractive service girls) who spend a whole ten seconds contemplating where to sit us in her completely empty restaurant.</li><li>And this place does n't have Redbull ....</li><li>I like this place better than Turbo but again they really need to clean the bathrooms, add tp, fix the toilet cover and put a female sign on the ladies bathroom.</li><li>Ample seating so if Turbo ca n't host you then this place is your next best bet.</li><li>Although the name suggests a fast food oriental restaurant, this place is anything but that.</li><li>They must be smart to buy this place though- LOCAL GEM!</li><li>The place was run by a really nice, outgoing guy ( Jerry ?) who was talkative with everyone that came in.</li><li>Never leave a review for a year before completing it.** ... and besides the breakfast being average, the place smelled like a fish ' n chip place, which is great if you are going for fish' n chips, but not so great if you are going for breakky.</li><li>I am giving this place 3 stars since there are equally good Iranian restaurants in the area for lesser price and more flavourful meat!</li><li>There is hardly ever a place to sit because students set up camp and stay for hours, which is fine but not exactly welcoming for other patrons.</li><li>The place itself looks to be a broken down dingy place where they have cheap food for cheap prices.</li><li>The place is located on a strip mall next to Food Basics.</li><li>The place itself is a takeout place but it does have a decent sized dining area.</li><li>Would not recommend this place.</li><li>This place definitely had competition since just more down the street south of Finch, theres Sushi Legend which I believe alot more people are going.</li><li>The location for this place is all that great.</li><li>I get that this place is a few months old, but they need to get their business together.</li><li>My first impression of this place was terrible.</li><li>( Ordered at 9pm) It was above average Chinese food and I would go back there again ...*** parking is not easy at this place****.</li><li>Still A-ok place to go to at 2 in the morning with no other options i must say, but do n't expect to b blown away by the service or the food.</li><li>I 'm surprised why there are n't any updated reviews of this place.</li><li>The place however, looks more like a restaurant that I actually want to spend some time in.</li><li>The place is somewhat hidden as I had never noticed it before looking it up on the website.</li><li>The place suppose to be Persian food but it seemed more American to me as it is all fries, pizza and subs.</li><li>Looked tired and I felt like an inconvenience to them. not good The place: Dusty.</li><li>Also this place is a sister chain to NY Fries, so those are the types of fries they serve.</li><li>This place is miles above any ayce.</li><li>The place is clean with nice furniture.</li><li>I went on a Thursday night with no reservations and there were no tables available, what is this place, the Ritz ?</li><li>Overall, this place is a valid option to come for drinks with a friend as they do have an extensive sake and wine menu.</li><li>I really like this place!</li><li>The menu of this place is very similar to Tomo with a few tweaks here and there.</li><li>I will definitely come back! this place is soo expensive. the dinner bento box is almost $ 20. the service is good and the food is great but the prices just arent worth it, at all. there are so many places in this area that are much more reasonable with the same quality food. the ambiance is really nice, which is probably why the prices are so high ... i probably wouldnt visit again. i 'd recommend for people with money to spare lol.</li><li>This place is the upscale brother of Momo Yama located just west of yonge on steeles.</li><li>This place is no exception.</li><li>Good place to eat.</li><li>That 's why I really like this place also, bc they are generous.</li><li>This place was a bit of a disappointment.</li><li>I 'm not huge on Japanese food but this place definitely changed my mind and shone as one of the best, if not the best, Japanese restaurants I 've ever been to.</li><li>Overall, this place was very tasty and better than other Japanese restaurants I 've been to.</li><li>The place is nicely decorated.</li><li>The restaurant felt more like a bar than a sushi restaurant, which made me feel a bit out of place ( everyone eating lunch here was wearing business attire; I had a backpack with me damnit!</li><li>One time they forgot the water and I had to ask someone else so that 's why I give it 4/5 but other than that good place! we stopped by for lunch today. the decor looked fancy, i like the environment. the price tag is a bit on the expensive side. you 're looking at 20-30 dollars easy per person. i do like their quality of food. we had some salmon and tuna nigiris and they were pretty fresh! the staff there are attentive. cute place! although this place was suggested by my cousin ( because his friend owns the place), i was unimpressed by their sushi/sashimi. it was n't fresh! yes, the place is nice, trendy and huge, but i would n't go here for their sushi.</li><li>Bottom line: this place is expensive but good.</li><li>Great place!</li><li>Spacious place, nice design.</li><li>I love this place.</li><li>Definitely recommend this place.</li><li>I absolutely love this place!</li><li>It always seems busy and has good reviews so I was expecting this place to hold up to that.</li><li>This is the kind of place I would take my friends to for a sushi dinner party.</li><li>My only complaint ( since I am a bit of a cheapie) is that this place is expensive at night!</li><li>Great place to go with friends and do a boozy dinner.</li><li>Went to lunch here today and I think this place is a little over rated. after reading reviews i expected a lot more ........</li><li>This is definitely a place to bring a date, your significant other, or a group of friends that want to chill and enjoy a nice sushi dinner together.</li><li>Moto is the place to go for Sushi if you live uptown.</li><li>The place looks real nice, we had a great time.</li><li>We were both stuffed by the end of the meal, but already thinking about who we were going to bring on our next visit to try more items on their menu ~ Prices are more than the average sushi place, but for service, atmosphere and quality of food I would say you definitely get what you pay for ~.</li><li>Firstly, this place is semi expensive so I expected good food.</li><li>The food is amazing, the place is clean and the staff is always polite.</li><li>Love, love this place!</li><li>Classy Sushi Place- Perfect for impressing a date or entertaining fancy guests.</li><li>This place is quite nice from inside and comfortable seating.</li><li>Worst aspect of this place is the dry and stale wasabi.</li><li>The place is awesome, the service is unbelievable, thanks to the management for a job well done.</li><li>From the gigantic salads to the delicious sushi, this place is worth the trip up!</li><li>So Let the good times Roll!;) The place is very trendy and spacious.</li><li>The place is good for a night out with friends if you just want to eat some sushi and over pay for the food. but for God sake, do n't order the salad.</li><li>The place is a really small area but the food makes up for it.</li><li>The place was dirty and run down.</li><li>Love this place !!</li><li>Love this place ... always get the caesar salad, escargots and a veal dish ..</li><li>This is not a fancy, sophisticated, nor contemporary place, shabby for some, but Chez Laurent is a quiet authority on experience.</li><li>The only downside to this place is the service was a little slow ( At one point, I think the owner forgot about us- she said she would be right with us and then just never returned), but I was n't in any hurry, so it did n't really bother me.</li><li>There was one other couple in our room who talked our ears off through the entire meal about how awesome this place is.</li><li>Love, love, love this place.</li><li>Great place.</li><li>This place was great!</li><li>Nice addition to the area:) The country style that used to be here ( local 24 hour study spots woo!) was a bit outdated, however they 've done a beautiful job with the interior of the place, as its now very nicely lit, theres tv, radio, warm ( -15 out today) and its in good shape now.</li><li>I highly recommend this place.</li><li>The place is nice and clean.</li><li>But I 'm a male in my early twenties whom although deeply admire the old and traditional ... finds this place just a little too retirementesk.</li><li>The place is surprisingly clean, bright and spacious especially for this area.</li><li>Due to all the residences nearby ( lots of senior housing) this place is always busy. if you actually want to sit and eat in here ... well good luck if you find a seat.</li><li>Anyone in the mood for great food, a wonderful baked good or an adventure down the aisle to try a little something of an international taste IDF is the place to go.</li><li>So gross, please avoid this horrible place! was ordering a pizza from that location, tonight. the pizza was OK. and they came just on the last second as they were looking for my house. would not order again probably, there are way better places for pizza in the area like King David Kosher Pizza.</li><li>This place is a joke.</li><li>So, I like this place.</li><li>Other than that, I love this place!</li><li>The place was decently busy but we were seated immediately and had fantastic service the entire night.</li><li>I 've noticed that this place is never as full as the nearby Oliver &amp; Bonacini restaurant, but Il Fornello has recently started to offer brunch, so that 's made them a bit more popular.</li><li>The place was packed on a Friday night.</li><li>I live relatively close to Laterna and its great to place an order for pick up, or sit down for a quick meal.</li><li>Stumbled into this place late one evening while they were still open.</li><li>This place is all right.</li><li>Nice place to pop in and check out.</li><li>After a night of shopping, it 's a great, casual place to dine with friendly staff and no worries about food quality.</li><li>Although this place is uncomfortably dark inside, the light of day on the patio revealed that all of our orders were presentable and free of suspicious objects or burnt edges!</li><li>The place was mostly empty when we arrived so I was a little apprehensive.</li><li>The place serves a range of food options, including souvlaki, pastas, stir-fry, pub food etc.</li><li>If I 'm not sure what to eat around my area this place is the place to go since their menu is so vast.</li><li>If this were a fancy or quiet venue I would agree with them but the reason we chose this place was due to the fact that it has always been a family restaurant.</li><li>Found this place by accident.</li><li>And this place definitely got it right.</li><li>Great place.</li><li>Out of all the hookah places I 've been to rednile hands down is the best place I 've been too.</li><li>It 's located in a little plaza that I 've passed by hundreds of times and I 've never noticed this place!</li><li>( It was n't spicy for me at all but then again my tolerance to spicy food is high) All in all, I do recommend this place.</li><li>So I was extremely excited to try out this place!</li><li>This place was absolutely horrible.</li><li>This place is a hidden gem in North York!</li><li>I am no stranger to Korean soups, I practically have kamjatang coursing through my veins, but this place was my first experience with samgeytang ( ginseng chicken soup).</li><li>I do find that this place is a bit on the pricier side compared to other Korean restaurants, but the quality is definitely high When here for dinner the standard choices we get are the chicken ginseng soup and a hot stone bibimbap.</li><li>This place is in a random plaza just after Leslie and Finch .. a little hard to find because the signage does n't really stand out.</li><li>I would say this place is definitely worth a try.</li><li>I really love this place.</li><li>Maybe because the place was just a little bit off the common area.</li><li>I really like this place.</li><li>Other than samquetang, their menu selection is not very big, but I kinda like the fact that I do n't have to take too long to look over the menu It 's a pretty small place, so I 'd recommend a reservation to secure a spot on weekends.</li><li>This place is a hidden gem in a small strip plaza.</li><li>Best place to go on on a cold night. it 's a small placed so it can get crowded during peak hours.</li><li>Such a clean, modern place with friendly staff.</li><li>Not too many Korean restaurants in the area so if you 're craving traditional Korean food this is the place to go.</li><li>The place was n't bad I did find the Korean food more bland than other places I go too.their ambient is casual and it looks clean.</li><li>Place is small and could be hard to find parking or a seat during busy hours.</li><li>This place is probably the best restaurant for Korean food that 's not in Koreatown.</li><li>I LOVE THIS PLACE! a nice addition to the area, very fresh ingredients, ginseng soup is good but not overwhelming in ginseng.</li><li>The place is clean and staff is friendly.</li><li>As per the name of this place, we ordered the gingsen chicken soup and veal bibimbap.</li><li>It also came with 6 side dishes, and was surprised that this place did n't serve kimchi!</li><li>Overall fantastic place!</li><li>- APPS: This place does n't have mashed potatoes or a potato appetizer at all.</li><li>For a guy traveling from B-town, this place is ridiculously out of the way, and crammed into a small run-down plaza, but would it be worth the drive ?</li><li>I came here with friends that are HUGE fans of this place.</li><li>Oh yes, oh yes, this place deserves my highest rating of- SLAP MY ASS AND CALL ME SALLY !!</li><li>So with that I only had one last thing that could make me like this place: the food.</li><li>This place, however, perhaps not.</li><li>I am not a fan of this style but if you are, I am sure you will love this place.</li><li>The place was packed the night we went but we were the only Asians in the room.</li><li>The place is small but it 's definitely a reliable place in terms of what you can expect.</li><li>Anytime someone asks which chinese place to go to, I always recommend this place.</li><li>Love this place!</li><li>But the food is absolutely wonderful. we are regular customer, s at this restaurant, Tonight we ordered the usual, our favourte dish is peanut chicken, we brought our three dish, s home and upon opening the chicken we saw half the dish was peanut sauce and less than half the usual amount of chicken, I called the restaurant and spoke to the owner for ten minutes, she insisted that it was made the same as always, It was not at all, we paid 11,95 for peanut sauce and a small amount of chicken,, The arrogant owner could not care less, refusing to credit us for next time we picked up, or d delivering a new dish to our home, This place the staff is unfriendly, not well mannered, and horrible customer service, and the food was awful, except for the fried rice, it was good, If your looking for bad service this is the place to go, the customer is never right,, be warned,.</li><li>This place is located at yonge and finch- it 's a small little restaurant below an apartment building.</li><li>This place is a hidden gem.</li><li>Plus, I will definitely recommend this place to whoever wants good Korean food with friendly service.</li><li>Also, this place is more expensive than many other Korean restaurants I have been to.</li><li>I highly recommend this place.</li><li>But, in terms of customer service, this place is not the best and I 've experienced much better.</li><li>Honestly, this place is good for a quick lunch or dinner but it is not a place where one can actually relax and eat a full meal.</li><li>Definitely highly recommend this place, also good for kids.</li><li>The staff was friendly and the young lady serving us was very kind and asked us throughout if we needed anything, even though the place was jam packed and she was attending multiple tables.</li><li>I absolutely love this place.</li><li>But for those that want an energizing breakfast and do n't have any significant digestive ailments, why not this place ?</li><li>This place was busy !!!</li><li>Looks like they renovated the place, it seems like a very nice place to sit in.</li><li>If you just need a quick breakfast a step above mcDonalds- well Cora 's is the place to be.</li><li>Love this place!</li><li>The only good thing about the place was extremely efficient Asian server.</li><li>I have never walked into this place before 1am so my judgment could be a little clouded on this but this place always does the job.</li><li>Great place to stop by after the bar.</li><li>Well, ok, not worst, as there are places that gave me upset stomachs afterward, and this place, in all fairness, never has.</li><li>Positives about this place ?- cheap shawarma- can sit outside- open late.</li><li>I really love this place.</li><li>NOTE: This place does n't really serve you, so you do not need to give tips.</li><li>This place is a sh* t show.</li><li>The place is extremely busy with wait times extending up to 30 minutes and it is definitely under staffed which is why I would award 4 stars instead of 5.</li><li>The place is literally nutrition-free.</li><li>This place is like that guy that talks a big game, but all that comes out in the end is air.</li><li>The place was over rated.</li><li>Place is like a banquet hall.</li><li>Oops- that would be THAI Spring Rolls, an entirely different place, and rightfully deserving the 4.5 star rating.</li><li>The chinese food is tolerable if it comes with enough rice to absorb the extra grease and the saltiness of the stir fry, Chic place to hang out with friends.</li><li>This place was a huge disappointment.</li><li>The place was great.</li><li>The place itself is tiny but does have a nice patio ( a little surprising for a breakfast bar).</li><li>The place is clean, the service is quick and the employees are happy.</li><li>I love this place.</li><li>Okay it 's true- I eat here often, this is the kind of place you take your mother/ kids out for food.</li><li>I ca n't recall how many times I craved this place after a round of golf.</li><li>Granted I 'm partial to east Indian rotis but this place is near where I live so I had to see what the fuss was all about.</li><li>The place is out of my way but when I do end up running around nearby, I make it a note to drop by and get my hunger satisfied.</li><li>A great place, friendly staff, nice family business.</li><li>Good place to go if ur hungry &amp; need a snack.</li><li>Had the Beef Chow Fun and once I ordered it the cashier barked out the order in cantonese to old school short order cooks in their greased up whites, I knew this place could be for real.</li><li>I recommend this place without any reservations.</li><li>Yes this place is a bit on a the pricey side ( $ 9-13 for 6-8 huge rolls) but it is worth it.</li><li>This place is just a short walk south of Yonge/Finch station.</li><li>I live near East Chinatown and the vietnamese places were much saltier, this place is really good, in my books and seating is pretty good.</li><li>I went to this place today, me and my boy were walking around and decided to check this place out ...</li><li>There is a side seat right at this place ...</li><li>The place is really really pricy, one would often find themselves paying over $ 6 per dish, so if you wanna splurge, get the fish.</li><li>Like this place was was abit dirty, but the food was amazing.</li><li>The place was packed when we came in for lunch.</li><li>If you like spicy food, this place is for you.</li><li>The place is not exactly the cleanest and tables are covered with plastic just cause chili oil could create a mess.</li><li>I 'd definitely come back or recommend this place.</li><li>Im giving this place 5 star for my love of fish in chili oil soupy dish.</li><li>Short Version: This place is pretty authentic Chongqing food.</li><li>Having spent part of my life living in Sichuan, this place offers very authentic Sichuan food.</li><li>Sichuan food is widely recognized as the spicy cuisine in China, and if you are serious about getting authentic, spicy ( as the name of the restaurant indicates) Chinese food, this is the place to be in Toronto to try out for at least once.</li><li>Cafe bene is a warm and cozy place which makes it an absolutely great place to chill with friends and family.</li><li>Love this place.</li><li>This place is a little bit hidden, you have to walk up a small staircase at the entrance of a wings restaurant.</li><li>Perfect place to catch up with a friend or do some work!</li><li>Considering the nature of the yelp reviews boucing between ratings, it clear that this place is a great example of hit or miss. Would love to come back to check out the private rooms or order shaved ice, but it may be a while ... at least until my wallet stops sighing.</li><li>This place reallllly has a `` homey'' vibe ...</li><li>From what a separate reviewer has said, this place has been around for a couple of years already, it 's time to get professional.</li><li>Cute place, clean although the service was slow.</li><li>If you 're looking for a fun date night spot, this place is worth checking out.</li><li>The place is cozy with friendly staff.</li><li>I totally recommend this place !!</li><li>This place was a pleasant surprise, and an absolute gem of a place.</li><li>The only good thing about it is the interior which is kind of cute, but the place tries too hard to appear more than it actually is.</li><li>I saw a tree, leaf, happy face etc. in a nice big cup. as you can see in my picture I took, not only did it not come with a little image in it, it came in a small to go type of cup. taste wise, like a vending machine but I actually did n't mind, I liked it. to the cake, do n't let my picture fool you. the size of the cake was the size of my middle and index fingers put together. taste wise, straight out of a grocery store type of cake. and not the higher end grocery stores, more like price chopper style. but again, I actually did n't mind. what I did mind was the price tag that was attached to it. it was $ 12.99 for the drink and cake combo. to recap, to go type of cup drink with vending machine taste like quality and 2 fingers size low end grocery store quality piece of cake with high end cafe prices. and I forgot to mention the table we had. we were sandwiched between 2 other tables against a half wall and had a fake plant over hang us with its fake branch half way on to our table. too bad I 'm bad a describing the actual setting we were in, should 've taken a picture ( it is worth a thousand words). so based on the above description, this place should get no more than 2 stars. but you know what, the waitress had a nice smile and was friendly. this made all the difference in the world. will I come back ... probably not. maybe it was just tonight or my luck with the food/beverage. but hard to come back here when there are so many other options in area.</li><li>The place is frankly in the middle of no where right next to some traintracks.</li><li>The place feels like a slightly run down version of a jack astors or milestones.</li><li>This place is in the middle of nowhere ... just happened to be near my house!</li><li>If you happen to be in the area, I highly recommend this place!</li><li>The place is ok, food is good but the ambiance is a bit too dark to my taste.</li><li>This place is the best!</li><li>I ca n't get enough of this place.</li><li>I do n't really fancy this place to be honest.</li><li>The atmosphere was great, service great and a very nice, relaxed place.</li><li>I love this place! the food is typical pub fare but I LOVE their souvlaki dishes.</li><li>A few of my favourites off the top of my head ...- avocado milkshake- pho with beef balls and rare beef- chicken pho- banh cuon- spring rolls ( or egg rolls, whatever you want to call it)- com tam This place is small for the amount of customers dining and waiting to get into the restaurant.</li><li>I think that should tell you how good this place is.</li><li>Cheap dinner if you 're in the area, this place is a must!</li><li>This place reminds me of old days where you come in just to eat a good bowl of pho, nothing overcomplicated, nothing crazy fancy.</li><li>The place itself is fairly big.</li><li>Me and my girlfriend do n't know what it is about this place, I 've tried numerous pho stores and by numerous I mean a shit load.</li><li>For the price and quality of food, this place is amazing.</li><li>The place was pretty full for a weekday afternoon.</li><li>From all the places I 've been to so far, this place has the best avocado shakes ( $ 3).</li><li>I just did n't have anything that makes this place memorable.</li><li>This place is definitely worth a try, just do n't have such high hopes for the service.</li><li>Nice place- welcoming feeling like you 're eating pho with friends at home.</li><li>I do n't want to eat pho anywhere else now, this place is SO GOOD.</li><li>I have yet to have incredible pho but this place was n't bad.</li><li>I was really crazing pho and was in the area, saw this place had a lot of good reviews.</li><li>The place: The place is like any average Asian joint.</li><li>The place: The place is like any average Asian joint.</li><li>Wow, this place is pretty damn good.</li><li>I do n't reccomend this place to anybody.</li><li>I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good bowl of pho.</li><li>The place is small and has a vintage vibe to it.</li><li>The place is dated but the food.</li><li>It 's delicious and besides my dads pho and this place in Newmarket that I 've yet to make a review for, this is the best I 've had and I think it 's because they give you tons and tons of meat.</li><li>The place is packed during lunch.</li><li>So my friend had an entertainment coupon so we decided to try this place ...</li><li>Should have tried this place sooner !!</li><li>This place is usually empty but they really rush you to order, so annoying!</li><li>Came in for dinner with my girlfriend, the place is nice and inviting, well maintained and friendly staff.</li><li>This place is a local classics, having been a landmark in the area for over 200 years ( at one point owned by my great-great-great-grandparents!)</li><li>Pretty big place, outdated in its decor, mediocre service and food is ok.</li><li>Atmosphere- this place is very outdated in its design and their food playing was also absolutely lacking.</li><li>It feels like such an adult place, quite different from its glory days as Brunswick House of North Toronto of the 1980s.</li><li>A comfortable place, if a little off the beaten path in the heart of Hoggs Hollow.</li><li>This place does n't look like much on the outside, but it 's definitely worth the wander inside.</li><li>The place was really big and was pretty empty when we got there.</li><li>We went for a family reunion dinner and this place was such a surprise.</li><li>I heartily recommend this place to any discerning lover of fine italian food.</li><li>A place I would definitely go back to.</li><li>I highly recommend this place!</li><li>At first glance, the place is n't much to look at from the outside.</li><li>There is n't much that stands out about this place, which is just fine!</li><li>Kind of takes you away from the busy city life and into some relaxing place.</li><li>The place is a bit upscale but still low key.</li><li>For good service and great food, I would always recommend this place.</li><li>A good place to go for a drink but not a good dinner spot on a Monday at least.</li><li>This place is fairly expensive for a tavern, definitely above average bar prices but when you have dinner you have to order the bread and butter for $ 3.5 where most nice restaurants at a similar price point just bring the bread over.</li><li>LOVED this place.</li><li>The atmosphere of this place was nice and quiet although we did go at an odd hour so no one else was inside.</li><li>But other then that, this place is great and I look forward to eating in the restaurant soon ( we ordered take away this time).</li><li>The only problem about this place is that the place is pretty pricey comparatively speaking to the other sushi restaurants that I 've been to!</li><li>This place is around $ 10-13 for lunch which is a little pricier than other places around but its worth it.</li><li>I love this place!</li><li>One thing I did notice was there was only one waitstaff in the entire place during lunch time ( 1200-1300) and some of the patrons were understandably befuddled.</li><li>We got a booth seat which was nice and comfortable, the place is quiet enough for conversation with cheesy pop holiday music playing in the background which provided some giggles.</li><li>While it is a little on the pricier side, if you need a reasonably priced, but classy experience with a variety of food to serve different tastes, Anthony 's is a place to eat at. do n't be fooled by the white linen table cloths. this place is crap crap &amp; more crap !!</li><li>I can understand the poor reviews of this place.</li><li>This is the worst place I have ever been to.</li><li>Aesthetically, this place looks very tired and needs a make-over.</li><li>The place is more of a sit in and have your food, I ordered Spicy burger with Taters Poutine.</li><li>Love this place!</li><li>This place is fairly close to where I live but I have never gone in until today.</li><li>I love this place.</li><li>This place is the bomb.</li><li>My only one unpleasant experience is when a lady served us the shawarma plate and she forgot to top the rice with some onions and garlic sauce, ( place was not busy, only one person dining in and one takeout customer) so I had to walk back from the car in the rain to kindly request for the toppings that add a gazillion notch to this dish, which she gladly did.</li><li>My boyfriend and I are highly addicted to this place ...</li><li>The place is tiny and was probably a small Italian takeout as evidenced by this small Italian figurette that they left on the table ( probably from the old place ?).</li><li>I would try coming during the day because the place is kind of sketchy at night.</li><li>Place is run down.</li><li>This place is poorly managed clearly.</li><li>Great place!</li><li>I suppose this place would be just that.</li><li>If you like dominoes that is fine, but this location is a complete horrid place to expect any decent service from or any actual hot food.</li><li>Maybe because the place is a great choice for both large and small groups.</li><li>I really wanted to like this place, but it came up short in every area.</li><li>Best place to go to ruin a birthday!</li><li>The place was dead.</li><li>This place is dated in time, which often makes me scared it 's really dirty.</li><li>The place is small and a bit dingy, but whatever, the food is good, fast and cheap!</li><li>I would never recommend this place to anyone, just due to their unprofessionalism.</li><li>Will not recommended this place to any of my family or friends and it will be the first and last time going there.</li><li>The place looks like a dingy old street bar, despite being in a modern strip plaza.</li><li>It is a nice little place.</li><li>Highly recommend this place.</li><li>The place is in a majot need of a renovation, so that it can compete with the barrage of other restaurants so densely squeezed on this plot of land at Yonge &amp; Finch.</li><li>LOVE THIS PLACE TO DEATH: D** UPDATE** This place is closed for good and has been replaced with Yuzu Izakaya.</li><li>LOVE THIS PLACE TO DEATH: D** UPDATE** This place is closed for good and has been replaced with Yuzu Izakaya.</li><li>What it lacks in innovation, this place certainly brings it in terms of value.</li><li>This place is a Toronto institution.</li><li>The restaurant itself is a fun nostalgic place.</li><li>Best place in the area for some good high quality deli.</li><li>Service excellent: Place spacious and nice.</li><li>I absolutely love this place!</li><li>There were surprisingly quite a few people inside at lunch time even though this place is tucked away in the middle of nowhere.</li><li>I 've always been such a food food critic when it comes to japanese cuisine, but this place is definately on the top of my list.</li><li>I without a doubt recommend this place to everyone and anyone, and will definitely be coming back !!</li><li>Service was good, the place was decorated all ' Japanese' like.</li><li>I 've been here plenty of times over the years and still believe this place is a hidden gem in North York.</li><li>Highly recommend this place.</li><li>Normally, I do n't like going to places that mix different Asian cuisines together because I just do n't find that they can master all of them but this place was actually pretty good.</li><li>Not spectacular but a place I go to for a quick lunch.</li><li>Love this place.</li><li>This place is Korean own, so they have some Korean menu items as well.</li><li>Great place to share food and chit chat.</li><li>No wonder this place is n't busy.</li><li>Its funny because a parent from my kids school was asking me if I knew a place where they made cakes and goodies ... this place never even crossed my mind.</li><li>I would never refer anyone to this place, desserts are n't even that fresh.</li><li>This place is a diamond in the rough.</li><li>Check this place out, you wo n't be disappointed.</li><li>Just tried this place and ditto to what everyone else said.</li><li>This is the place to go if you want cheap delicious food!</li><li>Hidden in a dingey runned down plaza, this place is small cramped, poor ventilation but surprisingly has some pretty good food. beef patties are made fresh here and still on the trays.</li><li>Overall a solid 4.5 stars and definitely worth a try if you like Carribean food prepared by the awesome duo that run this place!</li><li>I ca n't stress how good this place is.</li><li>I really love this place.</li><li>Inside this place feels like a sauna in the summer.</li><li>This place also has the best raisin bread in the city.</li><li>I 'm glad this place is in my neighborhood.</li><li>This place is sooo good.</li><li>The place looks run down, cash only, but do n't be intimidated, try it!</li><li>Exactly like the yelp 3 star saying says ... this place is A-Okay!</li><li>The place was absolutely packed and buzzing ... really loud!</li><li>There were a few empty tables on a Saturday Night- but compared to the dozens of crappy Italian and French restaurants in town, this place should be packed and lined up down the street!</li><li>The place is an operational disaster.</li><li>This place is a joke, worse service I have ever experienced.</li><li>This place is n't as good as all the hype.</li><li>Was a little worried that there would be growing pains for the new place, but it seems to be running like a well oiled machine.</li><li>The place is brightly lit and has a modern, fresh look.</li><li>Driving near Yorkdale, we did a Google search for a Fish &amp; Chip joint .... this place popped up.</li><li>Yes, the place could go through some much needed renovations, make that the whole plaza in fact, but the history of batter and cooking oil have left their mark on these walls.</li><li>I noticed a group of men in their 70s dining in and sensing their comfort in a familiar place justifies the glory days of this place, however fishy it may be for some.</li><li>The place is nicely decorated and has a great location.</li><li>This place is nothing but rules, rules, rules!</li><li>I was always worried about coming to this place, it 's close by and it would be nice having a Italian restaurant in the area but coming on a quiet night, and from the moment we walked being told how it is made me come to realization that this place is n't going to work out.</li><li>It 's a small place and entirely family run, so the service is sometimes slow and they will sometimes run out of specials, because I guess they make only so many/night, but that just proves the family-run business atmosphere and the homemade food.</li><li>We love this place, the haddock is moist and F' in HUGE.</li><li>This place looks nice but the fish and chips are just average.</li><li>I always thought fish n chips would come with coleslaw but this place did n't.</li><li>I grew up in this neighbourhood and it seems that the people around my parents age love this place.</li><li>This place is small and was not that busy.</li><li>I 'd definitely go back to this restaurant again to try out their other menu items. family owned italian restaurant. short summary: very yummy food, portions could be bigger, sometimes slow service but very friendly lady owner, always packed at lunch, which is frustrating since they dont accept reservations. longer summary: the decoration of the restaurant is very cozy and gives a feeling of a patio dining even though it 's all indoors. the service though slow is very friendly and we often end up chatting with the owner for few minutes while we 're waiting for the order. it usually gets very packed at lunch by the people from surrounding office buildings. and since they do n't accept reservations sometimes it means that you have to arrive right after the doors are open ( which is 1130am everyday I think) in general very welcoming place but a bit on a pricey side.</li><li>The place cooked everything very well.</li><li>I came here quickly to grab a bite with my bf and was pleasantly surprised at how warm, cozy and chique the place was!</li><li>The place is pretty clean, quick service and alot of room to sit. only thing is cash order area where cash is a bit small, not alot of people can fit but it good food.</li><li>Compared to anything at bayview village, this place is `` reasonably'' priced for what you get.</li><li>Good place to come with a group of friends for a quick bite.</li><li>It does n't seem like a place I can go to complain, and $ 10 for inedible chewy General Tao `` chicken'' is just not okay in my world.</li><li>But there is a steady stream of people coming in and out, so the place is pretty bustling.</li><li>3.5 If you 're looking for a decent Chinese experience without all of the fluff, Sun Star is a place you might want to check out Pros: Food is pretty good Prices are OK Cons: Portions are smaller If you do n't know about this place, chances are you will never see it even if you 're driving by.</li><li>The place itself is n't very big so it fills rather quickly.</li><li>The place itself is not a lost cause, but food definitely could have been better.</li><li>The place is nothing fancy to look at but who cares when the food tastes this good and prices are so reasonable.</li><li>Also has this place in liquor licensed.</li><li>I will definitely be coming back here !!! arviderci Paolo see you soon! this is a really cute place close to my neighborhood, my boyf and i decided to come here after i read some good yelp reviews ( id seen the place before but never got around to actually trying it). the service was so friendly and he gave us 2 coffees for the price of one which was very sweet. i love the decor and music, its very old-timey. i ordered a chicken sandwich and he ordered an eggplant sandwich, which is vegetarian, and they were really good, my only gripe would be that the bread is a bit dry. otherwise its a really nice little place with reasonable prices.</li><li>The place itself is the ideal family restaurant that operates as a home business.</li><li>Yes, the place is shabby in appearance -- orange walls leave less to be desired, but the weather was nice and we ate outside.</li><li>And this place ... do n't even give it a first chance.</li><li>This place is pretty average.</li><li>There 's a small sitting area, but it is a purely by necessity kind of place.</li><li>DO NOT WASTE ANY DOLLARS ON THIS PLACE !!!!!!!</li><li>This is the worst place to go if you 're looking for a great burrito, quesadilla, etc. the place seems cold and you get the feeling that you 're not welcome.</li><li>Again, if you 're craving a burrito, this place should suffice.</li><li>As a vegetarian, I have to say the soy burritos are probably the BEST in the city ( THIS PLACE IS A MUST TRY FOR VEGETARIANS).</li><li>The place is charming, the wait staff is truly delightful ... a re-evaluation of the kitchen is essential.</li><li>The place was packed with Philipino locals which instantly was a good sign.</li><li>The place itself is pretty much a hole in the wall, but as soon as you enter, the mouth watering aroma 's over power you and you stop thinking about the interior.</li><li>Uhmmmmmmm ... yeah, this place is fantastic!</li><li>This place is one of my favourite filipino restaurant.</li><li>I totally recommend this place:).</li><li>I moved to the area and always pass by and see how busy this place is!</li><li>If you need a quick and filling Filipino food fix, this is the place to go to.</li><li>The place was small and I can see how it would fill up quick.</li><li>Well, this place was both totally worth the drive out to North York and my calorie count for the evening ( week really- yay cheat meals!).</li><li>A very tiny place but absolutely amazing food!</li><li>The place was packed with Pilipinos: natives eating at an ethnic restaurant is always a good sign.</li><li>Love this place I always come here for delicious smoothies and gourmet grilled cheese.</li><li>I really do n't like this place.</li><li>This place is a lot better than any pho place downtown.</li><li>Service is fast and indifferent ... good place to a fast pho fix!</li><li>I tried this place because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews.</li><li>This place recently has gone up in price ( on average I think $ 0.25 on each item) but it 's still a great place with the best pho broth.</li><li>The server was bringing out phos with her finger in soup. ugghh I am not a big fan of Pho but I go here with family because they love this place.</li><li>No one makes pho like this place.</li><li>This place is definitely on rotation of places to go routinely.</li><li>This place is a legend.</li><li>Very few places can offer take out that is restaurant quality, but this place does it ...</li><li>This place is located in a strip mall.</li><li>This place is a very close 2nd to my very favourite pho ' Hung long'.</li><li>I hope my friend finds another place to order her chicken from too!</li><li>Koreans love this place!</li><li>This place is the 2nd closest korean resto from my work ( the closest one is not even worth a mention).</li><li>I love this place!</li><li>The place is crowded yet clean and spacey.</li><li>If you have n't tried this place out then ur simply missing out.</li><li>Been here a few times The place is small so it 's recommended that you get a reserve Sushi is quite tasty Loved the enoki rolls .....</li><li>I have a `` go to AYCE'' but this place is now a number two place to go to.</li><li>Surprising for this AYCE place, the 40 salmon sashimi that you ordered, will actually come out!</li><li>The place runs like a well oiled machine and everything that was supposed to be hot, was HOT.</li><li>The place is rather busy, which is probably why.</li><li>This place definitely kick matsuda and tenichi in the butt.</li><li>But for those who love noodle, regular rolls, and all the tempura, side dishes etc. this would be the ideal place to feast!</li><li>I do n't usually expect much from ayce but this place was a pleasant surprise.</li><li>The place is clean, the service is good and fast too, you should reserve in advance if you come in peak hours otherwise you have to wait for quite a long time.</li><li>I would recommend if you are in the area, and crave an ayce sushi place, then this place is servicable. however i would not go out of my way to try it.</li><li>This place is definitely popular and packed- for a Monday night it was a full house.</li><li>Just no any other place would beat their quality foods. the sashimi are fresh and the hot foods are above average. this place is always packed, but soon you will notice it is worth the wait after you taste their foods. if they would have more selection of sakes that will be perfect as i am a sake lover: -p.</li><li>I want to recommend some favorite dishes but i realized i love a lots of them. scallop sashimi I believe they use different grade from other AYCE place, fresher and you can obviously tell they are all jumbo size. the salmon sashimi with herb sauce is in my must eat list ... etc ....... try them out, you wont be disappointed.</li><li>Food wise, this place is pretty decent, the Scallop Sashimi and the Squid ( Ika) Sushi are indeed the highlight of this restaurant!</li><li>So when I try out a new AYCE place, I judge it based on the quality of the sashimi, and the variety of sashimi and sushi.</li><li>I would definitely recommend this place!</li><li>Well, this place has been SLAMMED with Japanese folk every single time I 've gone, and for good reason.</li><li>This place was n't all that amazing ..</li><li>I wanted to like this place and to be quite honest I do n't think I can rate it fairly when I was n't able to try dinner as I currently have a bun in my oven ... seemed pointless to go for dinner when I ca n't eat the best part ... sashimi.</li><li>I guess this place is pretty busy with all the people who come to the finch/leslie plaza.</li><li>This place is considered a good AYCE.</li><li>I tried this place out based on a few recommendations from friends and family.</li><li>The place was busy, but we were quickly seated even though a few people in our group were still on their way ( cool!).</li><li>This place is very busy, and good thing they just opened up a new and bigger location near Huntingwood and Brimley -- will definitely try that location out as well.</li><li>This place is always busy so make sure you either come early or get a reservation.</li><li>Highly recommend this place.</li><li>Place is small so waited at least 20 min for a table for 2 Friday at 7pm.</li><li>I absolutely love this place!</li><li>The place itself is relatively new and has a nice modern decor.</li><li>The place looks fairly nice and the prices are pretty good for lunch.</li><li>The place was packed with families on a Sunday afternoon.</li><li>This place is a good place for a buffett!</li><li>The place are opened by Mainland China people.</li><li>BUT it is the best place I 've been to and here 's why: Set up: very spacious location with a nice layout.</li><li>Tenichi is the place to go for AYCE japanese.</li><li>The place closes at 11.</li><li>The place was mobbed and there was a line.</li><li>I deducted 1 star because the place could be cleaner.</li><li>In conclusion, this place is overpriced, food with terrible ingredients, and bland presentation.</li><li>Definitely will not be coming back and would not recommend this place.</li><li>Place is really busy.</li><li>The place is majority of the time clean and the furnishing is fantastic and comfortable.</li><li>Place is really busy all the time but once you are seated, you 're good.</li><li>I love this place!</li><li>The service is decent, and I recommend this place to someone who likes to dine in a very casual setting.</li><li>The place is small and tables are tightly packed, but they serve great, fresh, made-to-order, no nonsense, authentic Filipino food ...</li><li>The place is busy, but service is quick and they do n't miss a beat.</li><li>This place is heaven for someone craving for a home cooked meal without the Max 's of Manila ambiance.</li><li>This place reminds me of the small eateries back home in smaller towns/ ' probinsha' outside the city where you sit in front of the cook as she serves you fresh selections like ' bulalo' served with rice, ofcourse.</li><li>The place itself is rather small and the decor inside resembles a cheesy island restaurant.</li><li>CON: Place is too tight, they have a tiny space.</li><li>The place is a tad small ( they should expand- hint hint!) but the service is quite fast ..</li><li>I can not get enough of this place!</li><li>Keep in mind, this place is so popular they sold out of lechon kawali at 6pm on a Sunday.</li><li>This place is your typical fast food shawarma joint with some tables and seating available.</li><li>Anyway, this place is certainly cheap ( daily special), but you get what you paid for.</li><li>Terrible place.</li><li>The place does not have AC so the pho usually has a lot of nats.</li><li>This place is gross.</li><li>This place was great!</li><li>COSTS This place is a tad more expensive than the traditional Pho restaurants.</li><li>The place is pretty good.</li><li>The place is pretty busy every night, which is good considering the area.</li><li>Parking is plentiful around the place, and it 's not bad for groups either.</li><li>Best place in the area.</li><li>However, this place 's broth has the right amount of taste.</li><li>The place went through a renovation and it looks so much brighter and cleaner.</li><li>This place is quite nice.</li><li>Good place to go with your date.</li><li>There 's a modern chic feel to this place, the only thing that gives it away that it 's a Korean restaurant is the Korean pop videos playing on the flatscreens.</li><li>I love this place!</li><li>I had delivery so I cannot comment on the environment or the service of this place.</li><li>Tim Hortons is the place to be.</li><li>The place is never full when I am there ( there were only 2 other people there when I went today).</li><li>I had no idea this place was called Siloam Sushi.</li><li>Perfect place to get some studying done on weekdays, weekends can get pretty busy.</li><li>This place is a little restaurant for bubble tea or homestyle Taiwanese food/snacks.</li><li>The place is cosy and inviting.</li><li>Honestly went there before I even noticed this place, give this store a chance, and have n't looked back ever since.</li><li>I highly recommend this place:) Enjoy!</li><li>I thought to myself that this place is n't so bad and probably worth another try.</li><li>The place is clean and quiet.</li><li>So I was in the area and after hearing a lot of stories about the place, decided to have lunch there.</li><li>Place needs some renovations but their low prices and wonderful tasting food completely make up for it.</li><li>As I thought about it more and more, I felt like this place deserved more then the tip I left them.</li><li>The place was packed which is a great sign.</li><li>The place does n't look that appealing from the outside due to its location but it 's Toronto, so the food is what matters.</li><li>Amazing place.</li><li>For people looking for a bang for their buck this is a place to go.</li><li>The place looked clean and the service was okay.</li><li>I ca n't vouch for the authenticity of this place but the taste was excellent and there seemed to be a lot of Caribbean folks in line so that speaks volumes.</li><li>I 'm giving this place 5 stars for the one item I tried.</li><li>The place does seem a little sketchy at first based on its location, and inside, like more Carribean take out places are very basic ( not updated) Note, they do not take credit or debit.</li><li>Definitely wo n't come back and recommend this place to anyone.</li><li>The place is a marble rotunda style atrium with lot of original art exhibits.</li><li>So this place is a bit hidden in a local community centre, and it is a bit weird to be walking into a dressy place with people in gym sweats staring at you, while working out.</li><li>I highly recommend this place.</li><li>For a city that loves falafels it 's a travesty that this place is n't well known.</li><li>As far as customer service and cleanliness goes, this place gets two stars.</li><li>The place was absolutely TRASHED- like food garbage on every single table there.</li><li>The place was fairly clean and the washrooms are relatively clean compared to other comparable restaurants in the area.</li><li>This place is by no means fancy, but if you 're craving Hungarian schnitzel, those delicious dumplings in gravy, or cabbage rolls, this is your place.</li><li>Even though the place was small, she did n't seem to be able to handle all of the tables efficiently.</li><li>The place was very clean and the decor was aesthetically very nice.</li><li>Really nice place ... a bit small ... ok cozy!</li><li>This place is by no means the best Mexican food I 've ever tasted, but for GTA standards, it 's pretty good.</li><li>The place is kind of in the middle of no where, along Bathurst St. There 's no way I would have come across this place without the aid of the Yelp app though.</li><li>If you like Mexican food this is the place, good food, good prices, there beef burritos are really good.</li><li>Thanks to my Bangladeshian friend I now have a place I will have to ocme back to if I 'm ever back to Toronto again.</li><li>Adore this place.</li><li>On top of that, there 's so much variety that it 's definitely a place you would n't get bored of visiting again and again.</li><li>Love this place, food is fantastic and service is fast.</li><li>If you are looking for a place that sells good food for cheap, this is the place to go.</li><li>This place is sometimes a hit or miss but because it 's so cheap, most of the time you wo n't mind.</li><li>I love this place!</li><li>Love this place!</li><li>The food is good, but not worth the teeny portion size they give you. ... while i 've always known this place existed, it 's hard for me to remember that it 's there to try it out. located in a plaza on don mills but you ca n't really see the storefront and if you 're not looking for it you 'll drive by it completely. finally we got dinner takeout as we were searching on yelp. we ordered: live whole lobster with efu noodles- excellent. yeung chow fried rice- good, but the peas were slightly undercooked. sweet cruller rice noodle rolls, good. stir fried beef with vegetables, good. deep fried squid tentacles, good. fried turnip patties Singapore style, mediocre. sweet and sour pork, excellent. the food was great, the prices are definitely cheaper than congee queen. all of that for $ 70, and they deliver for orders over $ 25- which i did n't know until we picked up the food. love delivery, especially for the winter- will definitely return!</li><li>The portions are huge and when you 're in a carbo-loading mood, this place definitely hits the spot!</li><li>Decent place to head to after a softball league game.</li><li>Probably deserves a 2 1/2 but i 'm giving it a three because my friends seem to really like this place so maybe there 's something I 'm not seeing that they do.</li><li>I would not recommend this place.</li><li>The best place within a wide radius for Hong Kong fast food.</li><li>This place is in a decent location and there is always parking available unlike most places in Richmond Hill and Markam.</li><li>This place always provides great food and very quick service.</li><li>I love this place, but it 's only good to go during winter time.</li><li>A-OK is the perfect way to rate this place.</li><li>The place is hard to find it 's in the corner of a dingy plaza and the decor can do with a bit of updating.</li><li>Pho and Spring Rolls are generally the two things I try to tell if I like a Vietnamese restaurant and this place does both of them well.</li><li>The decor looks like it was bought from the tropical section of Party Packagers but the place is clean and the service was very good.</li><li>I never go out of my way for Thai food but this place was n't bad.</li><li>I know this place did n't get a lot of good reviews but I 'd like to take a moment to share my thoughts on this establishment.</li><li>Great place, great service and great food.</li><li>I give three stars because it 's still a good place to go eat and I will be back for more for sure, but this place to me lacks consistency.</li><li>I 've been to a lot of pho places, this place charge $ 6 for a big size special pho noodle, fresh side dishes and best hit chilli, give it a shot.</li><li>It 's a great quick place to eat!</li><li>That place is a must try.</li><li>When I passed by this place there was a man who was offering free chicken samples.</li><li>Love this place!</li><li>It was a large and spacious place.</li><li>The place itself is spacious and airy.</li><li>The place was very nice on the inside, and the lady that was there was okay but seems like someone who hates everyone and probably should n't be in that kind of work.</li><li>This place is slowly going downhill.</li><li>Like others have commented, this place is pretty clean.</li><li>I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for some good bubble tea and a place to hang out.</li><li>Long line ups at this location and there is very little place to sit.</li><li>The place is quite small so there is virtually no room to even stand in line properly.</li><li>10min to place the order and was told to return in 20min for the drink ( glad they gave me a heads up about that).</li><li>I do n't like giving one star reviews to establishments as I always give the place a benefit if the doubt, but for this place I would n't think twice.</li><li>This place is a waste of space.</li><li>The place is small and family managed, which would normally mean good service, or at least attempted good service.</li><li>However, this place is far from normal, in fact, its as abnormal as it gets for a restaurant.</li><li>The only place I order Thai food from in the area !!!</li><li>The place is small so seating is a bit limited during the rush times like lunch and dinner.</li><li>This place does a lot of take-out and unless you are as moody as the guy cashier i would n't really suggest eating in.</li><li>The place is like a family restaurant so it was a little slow at first but the server is super nice and knows the authentic Thai cuisine well.</li><li>This restaurant is a hole in the wall kind of place, and I realized that it 's one of the places I 've walked by so many times and never really noticed.</li><li>This is a nice Thai place in the area .. and it 's authentic ( the people who work there are Thai), not the nicest restaurant I 've been to but sometimes you 're just coming for the food!</li><li>My first visit there today and although the place seems a bit hidden from outdoor, it 's a nice cozy place on uptown Yonge street.</li><li>LOVE this place.</li><li>This place is hidden from the intersection and it is behind the plaza of the supermarket at Leslie and Finch.</li><li>The place is really small, and extremely red, not bright red but a maroonish-red but it was all over the walls.</li><li>The place is decorated well, but nothing special.</li><li>This place is n't much to look at on the inside and I reckon they could do a little work on the outside to give it more curb appeal but the service is friendly and the seating area is well laid out.</li><li>Unfortunately, this place is easily the worst Indian food I have had in Toronto.</li><li>Please take my advice and skip this place, they are not worthy of your money, business or patronage.</li><li>This is the place I go for if I crave for Pho.</li><li>It seems like a nice place to come grab some drinks and bite to eat ...</li><li>This place is a gem for great Iranian food.</li><li>I came to this plaza with the intent of going to Sushi House next door, but I got sidetracked when I saw this place.</li><li>I would definitely recommend this place!</li><li>Like Chatime 's all over Ontario, this place does not disappoint.</li><li>However this place is always busy, so that 's a good sign.</li><li>This place is always busy and service is pretty efficient.</li><li>This place is always busy but I will keep going back anyways.</li><li>If you 've never been to a chatime, this place has bubble tea like no other.</li><li>Most of the time you 'll see a line up outside of this place.</li><li>Staff were really friendly:) This place is very busy though since it also shares the same space as Bake Code.</li><li>Even though this place always full of people but waitress/waiter still wear their smile to server every customer.</li><li>Nice drink with nice service, no wonder this place always full of people.</li><li>Great place to meet up with friends, but that 's only if there is n't an insane lineup which can easily happen on any Fri/Sat ... and weeknights after dinner.</li><li>All my friends love this place to death and if I was n't deathly afraid of high sugar things, I 'd probably live in here.</li><li>That being said, the place WASN' T BAD.</li><li>If you go during the day, it is a nice place to study.</li><li>Best place for bubble tea.</li><li>The place was packed, but the service was quick and friendly.</li><li>Tucked into the small street if Willowdale ave, this place has a non pretentious atmosphere, the food is delicious and fair prices.</li><li>The service was okay, and I 'm not going to knock the waiter who was fairly new to the job, but we would not recommend this place.</li><li>OK is sort of the perfect description of this place.</li><li>This a good local place, well attended and well liked.</li><li>This place is always busy during the dinner hours so it 's better to put a reservation down or you can order takeout online on their website.</li><li>If you like saucy pastas, this place is definitely the place you want to visit.</li><li>Definitely a nice looking place since the expansion and the latest renovation.</li><li>I will definitely be coming back and recommending this place to all my friends!</li><li>Years ago, this place was a small, mostly take out pizza place at Bayview Village Mall.</li><li>The place is n't half bad ...</li><li>Live this place.</li><li>Unfortunately, my memory seems to have failed me when it comes to the ambiance of this place.</li><li>Like I said it was only a convenient place to visit.</li><li>By the time we left ( around 7-pm), the place was very busy but I still saw some empty tables.</li><li>The place is clean, has ample seating, sports on mostly ( great during boxing championships or hockey playoffs) and is a bit dim even for a sports bar.</li><li>Ok, so back to the actual pub. This place is a long, inside box!</li><li>It 's a slightly small place and had to wait a couple minutes for a table to free up at 6:30pm on a sunday but that was okay.</li><li>The place was fluorescent lit with a lot of smoky smells coming from the other tables having BBQ at their tables.</li><li>The place looks rather small but is divided into two dining room halves that resemble old old Asian establishments where every party gets their own little mini room.</li><li>This place is on point with their food, no complaints there!</li><li>Love love love this place !!</li><li>Fluorescent lights and the place could use a makeover.</li><li>Last note: the ventilation at this place is n't great so be prepared to leave the restaurant smelling like Korean BBQ for the rest of the night ( and possibly do laundry when you get home).</li><li>That said, the service was great, the food was great, the place is clean.</li><li>This place is no different.</li><li>Only 1thing about this place, waiter showed us to our tables, did not introduce himself.</li><li>This is not a budget type of place.</li><li>The place felt classy, food was not bad.</li><li>The place itself is very romantic inside with a very intimate and dim setting with a quiet ambiance.</li><li>The place was n't very busy on a Saturday night, but I figured we went rather early.</li><li>Looking in from the outside, this place always appeared very dark and gloomy, and when we were seated inside, the interior is pretty much the same.</li><li>This place may be inconsistent, but they were on the night we visited, and they fully deserved their rating.</li><li>There are n't many Italian restaurants in the area so if you want a decent Italian meal this is the place to go.</li><li>The place does n't have a cool hipster atmosphere like places downtown.</li><li>I was craving some chicken and this place was right where I was and I thought I would give them a shot.</li><li>I highly recommend this place.</li><li>If it was n't for the friendly lady behind the sweets counter, I would have given this place a 1-star.</li><li>My stars are mainly attributed to the decor of this place.</li><li>I first thought to myself `` This place looks nice!''</li><li>Satays were also pretty nice; a lot of places fail at the sauce but this place was pretty authentic.</li><li>While a lot of places use ketchup to compensate for the flavours and colours, this place did not.</li><li>The place is lovely!</li><li>While dining, the waitress would converse with other diners, however she never checked in on our table once, other than to whisk away plates the moment our food was done- we felt rushed the whole time and the place was n't even busy!</li><li>I like this place.</li><li>The place is well decorated, which creates a unique ambience.</li><li>Ambience: The place does get an A for decor.</li><li>This place is pretty chic and nicely decorated.</li><li>Nice quiet cozy place.</li><li>Definitely wo n't recommend this place to anyone!</li><li>And the foods were just ok, even Thai express had more taste and flavors than this place!</li><li>The curry itself is amazing and not too spicy and the beef is tender on the inside and has a light crispy outside. i ca n't get myself to try any of the other mains! for apps i 've tried their mango salad ( note that there 's coriander in it, which I hate and mint leaves which I also do n't like), beef satay ( not bad), and their fried calamari ( I would get this again and loved the honey chili dipping sauce it came with). desserts I 've tried their mango sticky rice ( the mango was not sweet and really hard) and their deep fried banana with honey ( just standard). the decor here is super cool and there 's a nice patio area for the summer, I love this place!</li><li>However, the service was so horrible the one time I went that I just ca n't see myself recommending this place to anyone.</li><li>Generally I do n't like to spend too much on food but for this place I can make an exception.</li><li>I would hate to give 2 stars to this place but every time we go there, service is terrible.</li><li>I love Thai food, but this place was just average for me.</li><li>This place is a bit pricy though for what is it.</li><li>Anyway, nice place to relax if you like.</li><li>Blame only yourself if you need to ask where this place is, and what you receive in return is a look of awkwardness.</li><li>Gotta love the name of this place.</li><li>If you live in the Finch and Leslie area or anywhere near by, this is the place to go to get your Chinese BBQ fix.</li><li>Another place I would not be returning to.</li><li>Overall, this place is n't bad for grabbing a quick bite with no expectations for service.</li><li>There are n't a whole lot of vietnamese restaurants in the thornhill area so we though we would check this place out, as it has a 10% grand opening discount.</li><li>The place is spacious, a little ugly, but you 're going to a place like Katz ' for the food, right ?</li><li>The inside of this place is downright weird.</li><li>Love this place, simple, simple.</li><li>First off, this place was a little confusing to find because the sign on the road was in between 2 plazas and we wandered into the wrong area.</li><li>This place is very overpriced for a sandwich, and both the meat and bread was very dry.</li><li>He keeps telling me how great this place is ... how this family-owned business is so ethical and how their standards are so high.</li><li>The place was easy to find, and was a short little walk from the hotel.</li><li>The place looked a bit run down.</li><li>Great place just not like the ones in Montreal.</li><li>For smoked meat/corned beef/pastrami cravings while you 're in toronto this place is pretty good.</li><li>I wanted to love this place ...</li><li>The place was fresh.</li><li>They did n't even pick the art to put on the walls yet, that 's how fresh this place is.</li><li>The place was still renovating, did n't have a lot items on their menu and I got the wrong dish.</li><li>Overall, I was very disappointed with my experience here and I would n't recommend this place.</li><li>This place charge us $ 2 for 4 dinky sheets of rice paper!</li><li>Not that I ever expect much from a fast food place, let alone a McDonalds, this place takes the cake for exceptionally poor service.</li><li>It 's toonie Tuesday and I did n't want kfc so I came here not my first time I 've been coming to this exact location for years love the warm greeting you get as you walk in the foods always the same when you come here great that is hands down I love this place.</li><li>It 's not a nice looking place ( from the inside or the outside) 4.</li><li>No wonder this place has the worst rating from the other Mr. Jerk.</li><li>The place itself is strictly for takeout and only takes cash and debit.</li><li>The place is open a bit later than many other places, but as with most, the earlier the better.</li><li>Every Lamb and Beef dish on this picture friendly menu is AWESOME. go in for a warm lamb stew or chef 's special soup in the winter, or cool garlic cucumbers in the summer. their beef or lamb chinese style pancakes are YUM -- delightfully puffy and filled with perfectly seasoned meat. their house special beef noodle soup is cravable! you can taste the time and love in the soup base. ughh so goooood .. and the hand pulled noodles are as real as they get outside of la chine. seriously ? who cooks like this anymore outside of china ? -- these are classic techniques! the decor is kind of hilarious though, a lil step up from a hole in the wall, it 's definitely clean, but it also feels like you 're in the middle of nowhere china, really really first gen. like you 've escaped the city. and nothing matches. the walls are cheerily painted like you 're walking into the plateaus deep into china, starkly contrasting the leather booths and the crazy yellow seat covers that match the trilingual waitress 's outfits ( they mainly speak mandarin, some canto, and english). the TVs are always playing old 50 's chinese black &amp; white talkies, and there are neon signs boasting great halel food! the chef is usually out and about greeting the customers- he 's won awards for his food, and i agree -- this place is seriously the best regional lamb and beef dishes that 's hit the east side of this city since ... johnny 's burgers. i highly recommend this place! because i 'd be so sad to see it go under because no one knows about it. deserves my YUM YUM approval fo sheezie;).</li><li>The place is plastered with random Chinese calligraphy drawings that has nothing to do with the Xinjing Muslim theme, and adverts of the restaurant itself, just in case you forgot where you were.</li><li>Love this place.</li><li>The place is clean and spacious.</li><li>This place is just okay.</li><li>This place is very different than any Chinese place you have ever been to in Toronto.</li><li>Absolutely love this place!</li><li>The place was quite nice and service was really great.</li><li>Overall I do like this place, their food is generally pretty good and if you like lamb, you should check it out.</li><li>This is not your run-of-the-mill Hakka place, this place serves Xinjiang style food, so do n't think Hakka or typical Chinese food, the spices here are very different.</li><li>Fantastic place to eat!</li><li>This place is all about the Lamb and beef dishes, hand pulled noodles and fresh naan ( pancake).</li><li>This place I noticed was quite the quiet joint even with all the space they had.</li><li>Tldr, Awesome place !!!</li><li>Well, I gave this place 5 stars for its friendly waitresses, variety/ quality of dishes.</li><li>Will add this to my list of favorite restaurants:) I am so happy to have discovered this place!</li><li>If you love lamb, then you 'll love this place.</li><li>The place is clean and it 's pretty nice inside.</li><li>I was veru upset when this place took over one of my favourite chinese restaurants- RICE PAPER.</li><li>If you can handle spices, you 'll like this place.</li><li>The place is well designed.</li><li>I do n't think I would come back here, this place just lacks in selection and flavour.</li><li>This place is in a small plaza in a neighbourhood across from Fairview Mall.</li><li>The place was very clean and the servers were nice.</li><li>However everything about this place was nice.</li><li>Yes, the people that work there look at me and my cousin ( Yelper Z) very weird like I was in the wrong place BUT O MY GOODNESS!</li><li>I was nearly pick-pocketed here by the migrants that frequent this place, but I had my wallet chained to my belt loop and scared the kid off when I looked over.</li><li>I have tried different place around Toronto and this place is the best so far.</li><li>I 've never had authentic Armenian food, but some of the other reviewers point out that this place is n't really Armenian.</li><li>I am not sure why people r raving about this place- r we tasting sane food.</li><li>This place is located conveniently near my workplace, so I 've come here for lunch a few times and loved it!</li><li>Do n't be fooled by the exterior and the neighbouring shops in the plaza, this place is a gem!</li><li>The place is not fancy but the service is terrific.</li><li>I love this place.</li><li>Would give it five stars but this place is badly in need of a makeover.</li><li>Great place.</li><li>There 's quite a few mixed reviews about this place, but since I was there on a Sunday, it was quiet.</li><li>This place needs some attention.</li><li>It 's an unassuming place to say the least, located in a strip mall on a block of strip malls and apartment buildings on Victoria Park, it has a small sign and very understated and dated decor.</li><li>I would way this place does not deserve a four star if you are looking for a flavourful meat item.</li><li>This place is a keeper and a must try.</li><li>I really wanted to like this place more ...</li><li>As I 've mentioned, I really wanted to like this place more.</li><li>Overall I give this place** 1/2 stars.</li><li>Favorite place to go as a kid for breakfast !!</li><li>Located in the far north of the city, Kivas is the kind of place where everybody knows your name.</li><li>Service could be better and the place could be less packed, but you ca n't control that sometimes.</li><li>Great place.</li><li>Been there only once but excellent place to eat.</li><li>The place is always packed, if you want brunch go really early morning.</li><li>Great local place !!</li><li>About standard pricing $ 9 range for Benny Kids breakfast is really nice- not cheap but good portion The place is a bit small, but the food is fresh, you can see the guys making it.</li><li>Not only was the food horrible and the price too high for what you get, but this place would be better served as a adult film store due to the bad lighting than a restaurant calling itself the `` Sunshine Spot''.</li><li>Its fine, nothing amazingly tasty but if you are in the area and want to grab a bite, this place is acceptable as long as they are not too busy because then the attentiveness from the server seems to be lacking.</li><li>Great all day breakfast, but the place is a dirty and very old.</li><li>This place is only open for breakfast and lunch so as soon as the sun sets, you 're out of luck.</li><li>The place looks rather small but is deceptively spacious.</li><li>The place is packed at about 10am on a Saturday morning ....</li><li>There is nothing positive about this place I can write about, I will never recommend this place to anyone ... oh wait- one good thing: free wifi.</li><li>I 'm torn to write this review ... because I really really wanted to like this place a lot more ...</li><li>Very nice looking place- and with the $ 8.99 Schooners and also the $ 8.99 burger night.</li><li>The place looks like it 's going to fall apart.</li><li>The fact that the place is now filled with `` Deal-finders'' &amp; `` Groupon-ers'' makes me a little skeptical as to how sustainable this place is.</li><li>The place is definitely under-staffed and it 's definitely not the waiters and waitresses faults for not being up to par with service.</li><li>If you expect high end, modern, fancy, trendy ambiance, this place isnt for you.</li><li>If you want good food and down to earth wait straff and low key restaurant, this is the place to go.</li><li>I have also had lobster in Maine and cooked the Lobster fresh from T &amp; T supermarket and by comparison, this place is very good.</li><li>I really want this place to survive.</li><li>I do not recommend this place to anyone.</li><li>Prior to visiting, I read that this place is under new management and the quality of food and services have gone down.</li><li>I do not recommend this place to anyone- you can find other excellent seafood restaurants in a similar price range and Lobster Trap cannot compete with them.</li><li>The place is pretty packed for a snow-storm, was wondering why even though it is so busy that they only have one person serving so many tables.</li><li>I 'm not a lobster fisherman nor a commodities economist when it comes to seafood but when I 'm used to lobster prices at Chinese restaurants, this place I find is a bit on the pricier side.</li><li>Great little place with just plain old good food and nice service.</li><li>The place is run by the same two ladies that I 've seen each time I 've been there.</li><li>The place is clean, the service is good, and the food is tasty it 's definitely one of the better Vietnamese places in the area.</li><li>Place is clean.</li><li>The place is clean though.</li><li>Great place to get some Pho!</li><li>This place is definitely one of those.</li><li>I had the weirdest chinese dish; perhaps this place is a bit too traditional for me.</li><li>Thanks to all you Yelpers that rave about this place, you definitely know what you 're talking about.</li><li>Place is very clean and was nicely decorated.</li><li>Great place!</li><li>This place is busy 24/7.</li><li>Love this place.</li><li>This place is always good.</li><li>Great place to go for a meal, especially for big groups and families, though also works well for singles and couples.</li><li>The place is pretty big.</li><li>However towards the 5 PM, the place started filling up and you could see a line forming at the door.</li><li>My fave Congee ( royal title) chain, but also everyone else 's as well- This place is always packed!</li><li>This place is a chain, and some places are better than other, but this one is great!</li><li>The place was not very busy when we arrived, we were seated right away.</li><li>I would definitely recommend this place.</li><li>Although during peak hours, this place can be really crowded and seats/tables are a bit tight, I still like eating here.</li><li>We were here early for lunch and we were glad cuz even though the place is big, it still filled up fast!</li><li>The place is clean, service is quick, and the food is excellent.</li><li>We UYE 'd it:) The place was packed, but thank golly gee I made a reservation!</li><li>I do n't know what everyone is talking about, this place is not great.</li><li>It 's a bit out of the way for a downtowner like me but it 's not as far as the other good places to eat in Richmond Hill or Markham:) I have a good friend as well as an aunt who both live around the corner from this location and they love this place.</li><li>Third, their place are clean but their service and their actual kitchen is bad bad very bad.</li><li>This place is the only asian place that does not want to take your money.</li><li>Hey if you want some good congee, or decent chinese food this is the place to go.</li><li>The place was extremely crowded though, a lot of traffic in the afternoon.</li><li>I used to love this place, but sadly, I wo n't be coming back here.</li><li>The place is quite busy, so I found everyone chowing our chow mein rather quickly.</li><li>If you want fantastic chinese food that is at an affordable price this is the place to go.</li><li>I do n't usually eat congee but this place was good.</li><li>Place is busy.</li><li>I absolutely love this place!</li><li>This place is always packed on weekends.</li><li>Good place to hang out with friends in the evening.</li><li>Good place to chill ( with free wifi) compared to your local Starbucks:) I really like their drinks and snacks as well!</li><li>3.5 stars it 's an alright place to study since they offer wifi and close pretty late.</li><li>This place is very bright inside which can be annoying to those who are sensitive to lights.</li><li>Because this place is abnormally bright for a bubble tea joint, I 'm not sure I would enjoy sitting there for a long period.</li><li>The place is very small to begin with and only 2 servers working.</li><li>Great place to chill with friends and have a nice cup of tea.</li><li>The place is quite loud however and crowded as it is not quite that comfy compared to couches that are found in most bubble tea stores nowadays.</li><li>Nothing really distinguished this place.</li><li>This place is very reasonable for delicious Korean food.</li><li>However there is a big difference when it comes to this place and Chako.</li><li>This is a place to go for those who want it and also want All you can eat. the RIbs were good and a high point, as well as the spicy pork.</li><li>All in all though, I do n't think there 's anything distinctively special about this place, though if you want a large, unhealthy serving of meat ( we all crave this once in a while) then it 's a good choice.</li><li>The part that is shocks me the most is that genuine Koreans run this place.</li><li>But despite all the Korean restaurants, this place offers up AYCE, which is not as common around here as you think.</li><li>This place does n't have that option.</li><li>This place does n't.</li><li>If you want KBBQ with more than just pork belly, this is the place to go, as you do n't really have another choice in the area.</li><li>The place gave me a nice and warm feeling to be at on a super cold day.</li><li>A good experience for what it was ... but this is n't exactly a fine dining kind of place.</li><li>I really like this place.</li><li>The place is very casual and the service is okay.</li><li>This place is one of my favourite Korean restaurants to go to in the area.</li><li>I used to love this place, used to.</li><li>This little place is a Korean restaurant that seems to focus solely on stews.</li><li>Menu is rather small, as is the place, but they maximize filling in as many people as possible, with some cool little booths on the side as well.</li><li>This place is the only place that makes the table cooking chicken good.</li><li>We did n't get our appetizers until we asked them ( 30 minutes after we ordered) and it took about 40 minutes for us to get our food ... the place was n't even packed!</li><li>Overall, I 'd say, if you have n't tried this place before, then it might be worth checking out.</li><li>Seen a lot of my friends post pictures of this place ( very excitedly) on Facebook.</li><li>I love this place.</li><li>The place filled up by about 7pm, so be there early.</li><li>I would recommend this place to anyone who wants hot pot and does n't want to trek all the way to Markham.</li><li>Most of the food we had tasted fresh and, with the strange assortment of food I usually eat at hotpot, this place was pretty good.</li><li>The place is a little small and was starting to fill up when we were leaving so going early/ making a reservation might be an idea here.</li><li>I believe if you pay cash, you save 10%, even if the place is a little more expensive than i would have liked ( I think it was roughly $ 27).</li><li>The place is clean.</li><li>The place is a bit small so I can imagine that there is a wait time during prime hours.</li><li>The only reason this place does n't get a full 5-star is that it 's a little cramped.</li><li>Love this place.</li><li>Nice small place.</li><li>This place is pretty decent for the price.</li><li>I would definitely go again, and have no reservations recommending this place to anybody.</li><li>This place is SMALL!</li><li>OK I 'm gonna rate this place 5 stars but with a caveat.</li><li>The place is small and not have room to sit all the time, but food is great price is more than reasonable and staff are friendly.</li><li>I love this place.</li><li>This place probably has the best value of food in terms of price and quality.</li><li>This place is a hidden gem in the Willowdale area and I am so glad that my friend took us here to get some cheap grub.</li><li>The place is super tiny and incredibly cramped.</li><li>Reading other reviews, I knew this place was small but I was still a bit surprised at the size when stepping in to grab some takeout.</li><li>It 's a very small place with a few tables, and not a lot of room to move around.</li><li>Sushi Bong is a small place where usually people would go for take outs.</li><li>Sushi Bong is the place to go if you want decent and cheap sushi.</li><li>You ca n't beat the quality, quantity, and price of this place.</li><li>The place is super small and it 's more for take out than actually dining in.</li><li>The place is small for a sit down meal so we always take out.</li><li>People really seem to love this place, but I feel like it must be more for the quantity than the quality ... ?</li><li>3/5 for taste. small place with only a couple tables. most people take out. the take out is super fast. i do n't even bother calling in advance, the takeaway is ready in a minute or two. the sushi is great and very cheap. definitely recommend, especially if you live in the area and need a quick take out meal. when i go alone i get sushi bong special which is great. if you 're not alone there are some larger portioned specials with more variety which you can share.</li><li>It 's not an ideal place to sit down as they only have one table for 3 people maximum to sit.</li><li>Ca n't believe I did n't find this place earlier.</li><li>Also, I liked the vibe of this place.</li><li>It 's a small place with no gimmicks, but the service is fast and the fish quality is really great.</li><li>Even a sushi snob will appreciate this place!</li><li>Great place when you need sushi, sashimi and roll takeout!</li><li>The place is basically takeout only.</li><li>I would n't recommend dining in- the place is pretty run down tbh.</li><li>If you want cheap, decent-quality sushi, this is the place to go.</li><li>What can I say that would be any different from all the previous reviews of this place ?</li><li>It 's not a place you bring a date or go for a celebration, but for anything else it 's an excellent option.</li><li>This place is a great take out restaurant but if you go when it is busy your guaranteed to get terrible customer service.</li><li>This place is always busy when I go, I do recommend to call ahead to place your order before dropping by.</li><li>Definitely recommend this place!</li><li>The place itself is very small, i would n't eat in here- there are maybe 10-14 seats in total ?</li><li>The place is dirty.</li><li>The place is small but it 's also cold, especially in the winter time.</li><li>If you want cheap rolls this is the place to go.</li><li>It is a tiny, tiny place with three tables however, one table is reserved to put takeout orders on so do n't try and sit there because you will promptly be told to move.</li><li>Quickly dropped by one time as I was craving sushi and this place definitely did not disappoint.</li><li>However for the value I would not expect the most amazing sushi and if this place was near my house then I imagine I would continue to come here but oh well sushi bong bong that will not be the case.</li><li>I would not recommend this place to anyone, unless you feel like getting food poisoning.</li><li>I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick meal or snack at a decent price! came here because of the good reviews and was trulely disappointed.</li><li>The phone just kept ringing to place orders, people kept coming in to buy and pick up.</li><li>The place is located in a small strip mall area just 7-10 minute walk south of Yonge and Finch and is a small place.</li><li>Do not expect to have a seat to sit down but if you are looking for take out at great value, this is the place to visit.</li><li>The place is extremely small and the service is decent.</li><li>One word of suggestion however, there is very limited seating ( the place is the equivalent to the size of a study room) and there is only three or four tables to sit at so it is best to order take-out and eat elsewhere.</li><li>I guess this place is better for take out.</li><li>What 's not to love about this place ?</li><li>The place is very nice organized tight clean.</li><li>If they lower the price of this place I probably will be coming here more often.</li><li>It 's clearly apparent that people who lineup and suggest this place have never tasted good asian food in their lives.</li><li>The place is loud and crowded with people standing around the tables.</li><li>The place is small so expect to wait or get take out.</li><li>Considering the size of the restaurant, this place is way too small for the demand it gets.</li><li>This place is pretty small.</li><li>It 's a small place with just a row of in-wall table for single or couple diners and short tables against the other wall with in-wall benches and chairs on the other side.</li><li>Pros: huge bowls ( beef noodle soup $ 9.99, cold noodles $ 6.99- medium size but filling), handmade noodles in North York, a good size menu Cons: tiny shop ( has 4 2-person seats and bar stools for 5-ppl, even though it 's handmade it 's not as chewy as I 'd like I like this place because it 's not easy to find handmade Chinese noodles in the Yonge/finch-to-Shep area.</li><li>Do n't let the look of the food deceive u, this place is #puregarbage, everything is either mad sour or salty for no reason at all.</li><li>A lot of the time we had to ask them to fill our cups but they only refill half the table ( since it 's a small place w seating of 18 ppl, for some reason 2-3 staff r always standing near the kitchen doing nothing at all).</li><li>Small and cozy place in North York.</li><li>The place is small and I was very close to my neighbour who sat beside me.</li><li>I think whether you like this place or not really depends on what you try.</li><li>Point is, the size of this place makes it so that you can never really fully enjoy this place, which is sad because it 's a pretty good noodle.</li><li>I like this place, it 's just I never believe noodle places should be small.</li><li>The place sits a maximum of 18 and is super tiny.</li><li>The place is REALLY small and cramped.</li><li>The place is really small.</li><li>This place is small, do n't expect to eat comfortably here ( side note, they have AC!).</li><li>I would n't say this place is life-altering, and it wo n't do at all for people in a hurry, but it 's worth checking out.</li><li>Small place, service good and prompt.</li><li>Place is extremely small with only 14 seats.</li><li>Small place but great food.</li><li>This place is pretty popular.</li><li>Great place for dumplings !!</li><li>My mom &amp; her friends seem to like this place &amp; some of my friends do too.</li><li>Yap, I really like this place.</li><li>This place looks nice from the outside but that 's all that 's good.</li><li>A nice place to go a grab a coffee and sit and read on a late night walk.</li><li>A Good Place To Eat I come to this restaurant quite often.</li><li>Then you know, ten years later I forgotten about this place, until I needed to get lunch.</li><li>The place was always dimly lit, even in the window section facing North the Sun was mostly covered in foliage.</li><li>This place is going downhill.</li><li>I 'm reluctant to give them a 3, I 'm definitely not a fan of this place, except that this time we got a server that was decent.</li><li>This is the place to go when you do n't want your server to talk to you or go even near you.</li><li>The place looks great.</li><li>The place is busy from Noon through 3PM.</li><li>Without the elderly population who frequents this place occasionally because they live in the area, this place would have been closed years ago.</li><li>I was wrong, I have given this place multiple chances.</li><li>I hope I do n't sound like management, but I just love this place.</li><li>The place is clean &amp; the service was efficient.</li><li>The place looks like all Chinese restaurants did in the 80s/90s.</li><li>A pretty quiet place I never knew existed until a few days ago.</li><li>The place has always been very reasonable with its quality and service.</li><li>If you 're looking for a cool kitschy place, this is it!</li><li>The place is old and it shows.</li><li>The service is rather slow, but they never attempt to rush you to leave, so this was a great place to relax and socialize in the comfy chairs, as long as you do n't look too carefully at the wallpaper ...</li><li>This place is a TOTAL FIND in a small strip mall like area of Don Mills and York Mills.</li><li>I 'm surprised that this place does n't have more 5 stars.</li><li>The setup of this place is very nice, almost like a mini maze.</li><li>Speaking of cold, the place itself was freezing !!</li><li>The layout of the place was nice but when it 's that cold it 's hard to enjoy it.</li><li>It 's too bad this place ca n't find a rhythm, the food is incredible but the overall rushed feeling combined with delayed service is not worth the price.</li><li>The concept of this place is like Famoso- you go in, place your order at the counter, pay, then take a seat and your food will be served to you.</li><li>I like this place, the food is good.</li><li>Be aware: this place is incredibly overpriced.</li><li>Unfortunately, I need to lower my rating of this place.</li><li>What I liked most about this place, aside from the food was the open concept!</li><li>The only downside to this place is the limited seating, and if there are n't any seats then you are out of luck! ......... would I come back, I would if I 'm in the area, but would not go out of my way to come here just because of the set up of how the restaurant has its set up.</li><li>The place is not upscale, more like a hole in the wall but the best jumulruk ( steakettes) table top cooking.</li><li>The place was accommodating for a group of about fourteen people.</li><li>Everytime I come its clear the staff are working very hard, as this place is always packed and they are simply understaffed- Sometimes have to wait ( although well worth it) In this area there are MANY Korean options.</li><li>If you 're in the mood for Korean I highly recommend this place.</li><li>This place is definitely cramped: if you do n't get a booth, you may end up sharing a long table with two other parties, and it 's hard to get in and out of your chair to use the restroom.</li><li>This place used to be, still is like my food court or the place to go when I could n't think of what I wanna eat.</li><li>I remember this clearly because at that moment I all could do laugh at how bad this place was.</li><li>It 's no fancy date spot, but if you want tons of good food at an extremely reasonable price, this is the place to go.</li><li>All in all, average pricing for this kind of place.</li><li>The place was busy so we shared a table with another patron which is fine.</li><li>Minus one star because the place is small and its easily over packed with guests and also the pork bone soup only comes in spicy.</li><li>The place is pretty cozy and there 's parking at the back so it 's convenient to drive to !!</li><li>This place is our all time fav and we come back regularly for our bulgogi cravings, but it does get quite busy on the weekend.</li><li>What really set this place apart from other places is the sheer amount of side dishes that you get.</li><li>The place was n't super busy.</li><li>Decent place to have lunch but nothing very unique about it.</li><li>The place is very small inside, 4 booths and only 5-6 tables and barely any room for you to stand while you wait.</li><li>It is a small place with about 12 tables, they also have a room in the basement but it is rarely used, I have eaten down there once and its quite dark with low ceilings and not very pleasant.</li><li>Nice place to come, very private if you get a booth.</li><li>Just to show how good this place was, my brother came to Oh Geul Boh Geul a second time within that 24 hours, this time, for an earlier dinner.</li><li>So I came here for lunch during school with my friend since we both were craving bulgogi and on a budget but wow this place shocked me.</li><li>When I visit my parents and we want to go for Korean food, this place is where we go the most.</li><li>Overall, I do n't really recommend this place.</li><li>I 've had Korean fried chicken elsewhere ( i.e. ajuker, not good at all) and this place is the best in town.</li><li>The place was terribly cold.</li><li>Less one star cause this place added another inch to the spare tire I seem to be carrying around.</li><li>If you like KFC ( Kentucky fried chicken), this place will blow your mind.</li><li>Only issue is this place is often packed with a long line up.</li><li>Ambiance/decor-3 Service-5 Food-4 Strikeouts-0/3 This place is a bit dark for my taste, but still good enough to take pictures.</li><li>This place is also notorious for the bad service!</li><li>The place is also fairly loud with audio, so please be aware if you are looking for a quiet place ( it is not a con by the way).</li><li>The place is quite small though and sometimes it can quite busy on the Friday evenings and weekends.</li><li>This place is well worth a try!</li><li>Good place to go for groups.</li><li>I CANNOT SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS PLACE !!!!</li><li>I 'm also a full time athlete and this place does a great job at curbing my hunger!</li><li>Quiet place, cozy and literally the perfect spot to eat and go.</li><li>Came here for lunch as my favourite spot ( Triple Z) was closed; I really wanted to like this place as its so close to my work and the reviews are great, sadly I wont be going back .. had the chicken souvlaki and although it was moist the flavor was bland, no zest of lemon, no zing from garlic .. tasted like something I 'd get from a hospital cafeteria ..</li><li>Ming Lou Chinese Restaurant is just my kind of place !!</li><li>Came here for dinner tonight- I did n't pick the venue and would never recommend this place.</li><li>This place was a pleasant surprise I have to say!</li><li>Small place but friendly people, great jerk chicken, and price was just right.</li><li>Ambiance .... no Cleanliness .... questionable Mediocre Americanized Chinese food ...... check This place is a large run down looking resto with a friendly Chinese staff.</li><li>If your looking for an unhealthy and American style Chinese food experience, this place is probably ok for that.</li><li>We had the entire place to ourselves but at 2:30 PM this was not super surprising ( this changed as we were leaving, some families came in with kids for early supper.)</li><li>I highly recommend this place.</li><li>Great place- exquisite cuisine, peaceful atmosphere.</li><li>The place was busy and as soon as tables left, new parties would come in and fill in the tables.</li><li>The place is exceptionally clean and tidy.</li><li>This place is absolutely delicious.</li><li>I recommend this place to all my friends.</li><li>Or a great late breakfast place, however it does n't open until 12pm.</li><li>Definitely THE place to hit up if you 're with a small group of friends and looking for a place to eat and chat.</li><li>Pastel Creperie is a pretty cute, cozy, bright little crepe/pastry/tea/latte/coffee place ideal for hanging out with some friends and maybe groups of 6.</li><li>The place was a lot smaller than I imagined with tables to accommodate about 30 people.</li><li>Really nice little place.</li><li>Really nice dessert place.</li><li>The place is a bit small, but they have great selections of ice cream and crepes.</li><li>All in all this place is small and gets busy quick but service is great, friendly and fast.</li><li>It 's quite a nice place to share desserts and have a nice latte over a chat with friends, and we were lucky enough to sit for a good 1.5 hour despite finishing our order.</li><li>This place is busy, but worth the wait!</li><li>This place was right down the street from our hotel so it was very convenient.</li><li>Overall, I like this place.</li><li>Its a small, little place, but nice, cozy, warm, and friendly atmosphere.</li><li>Yes, I would recommend this place.</li><li>This place is nice n quit, the latte was really good, I have n't tried the crepe yet but will definitely go back to try it!</li><li>I can imagine this place to be packed at night though!</li><li>I 've been Pastel a few times for dessert but recently tried this place out for lunch.</li><li>I have been meaning to try this place but every time I walked by it was packed.</li><li>I like this place but I did n't find it amazing.</li><li>The place is very small so limited seatings while being very popular.</li><li>Then this is the place to be!</li><li>Located in North York in the Yonge/Finch area, this place is a great joint to have coffee and dessert.</li><li>Feel like the place is a little bit cramped for a party of 2 though.</li><li>I love this place!</li><li>This place is very small but nicely decorated ( lots of green!), it gives you a true coffee house experience.</li><li>If you are trying to bring your `` special'' friend to somewhere nice and a place where you can talk, this place is for you.</li><li>First of all, this place is so bright, clean and organized it puts our hospitals to shame.</li><li>I do n't recommend this place to any one.</li><li>This place is the bomb!</li><li>Highly recommend this place ...</li><li>The place is small and cozy and they have a lot of variety in the menu ( at least for a dessert place).</li><li>This place is small but bright and intimate.</li><li>The only downfall is the lack of seating because the place is small.</li><li>Nice and modern, this place serves some good lunch options like stuffed crèps and wonderful waffles as well as a good selection of some tasty beverages.</li><li>Love this place cause the staff love their job:).</li><li>Although the place is small it has a cozy and warm environment.</li><li>I love almost everything about this place!</li><li>This is the kind of place you come only for their specialty.</li><li>I introduced this place to my boyfriend last week and he left feeling satisfied.</li><li>The dessert came quick even though the place was full.</li><li>Every crevice of the waffle had nuts sitting in it* crunch crunch* It 's a wonderful clean place I dropped by for dessert especially after dinner.</li><li>This place is very convenient if you 're in a hurry, it 's near downsview and Mackenzie ci.</li><li>If you want an authentic Jamaican mama jerk chicken, Nanalyn Jerk is the place!</li><li>It 's no wonder that place is always empty.</li><li>When I want a milkshake or the durian or avocado shakes this is the place I go to as well.</li><li>Place is fairly dirty in general.</li><li>This is such a great Pho place!</li><li>But check this place out, great find for the area.</li><li>Pho Mi Asia is the place to go for the best Bún bò Hu and Banh Xeo.</li><li>If you just want a bowl of pho and you want it damn fast, this is your type of place.</li><li>The place is n't very clean as well ..</li><li>Horrid place.</li><li>Food is good but the place is n't cozy.</li><li>Best place in the GTA for Vietnamese food.</li><li>The place went through much needed renovations, they got rid of the awkward green walls and splashed some modern taste for a refreshing and upbeat place, great choice.</li><li>The place went through much needed renovations, they got rid of the awkward green walls and splashed some modern taste for a refreshing and upbeat place, great choice.</li><li>I am very disappointed with the food and the customer service of this place.</li><li>I would not recommend this place to anyone.</li><li>Now that i have taken the time to yelp the restaurant i realize I should have read the reviews first, before entering this place.</li><li>The place was homey and a little run down but nonetheless a great place to dine.</li><li>Sure Kiem-Bo is a dark, charmless place with christmas decorations up year-round.</li><li>The place does n't have a great ambiance, but the food definitely makes it worth coming here.</li><li>Great place to meet a client or a friend.</li><li>All in all, I really like this place.</li><li>This place is n't fancy, but it 's a wonderful alternative to the din of the food court.</li><li>Compared to other places in the area, this place is cheap for beers.</li><li>This place is the best-kept secret in the city.</li><li>This place is a huge waste of money.</li><li>Initially we started going there because of it 's close proximity to my parents ' place, but we keep going back because the food never disappoints!</li><li>Great place, I really like a lot of their dishes/rolls.</li><li>Great place, prices are reasonable and the food is consistently high quality.</li><li>The place is designed with pink detailings which is perfect for ladies night out.</li><li>The place is really pretty and clean, the girls were talking a lot about the table that we got, that had a nice style, and one funny detail was the background music playing everything, even Brazilian songs hehe ( just an info I 'm Brazilian ...).</li><li>To be honest, I 've heard raving reviews about this place, and decided to give it a try.</li><li>I really love this place.</li><li>I like this place.</li><li>I thought if I ordered different dishes the second time around, I would see the potential of this place.</li><li>This place is n't cheap.</li><li>If you work in the area and want a quick sushi fix, this place is a decent option, but I would n't go out of my way to try it!</li><li>Beautiful place though.</li><li>This place was great ....</li><li>The place is wooden themed, clean and modern.</li><li>Initially I thought this place was an authentic Japanese restaurant, but then after I saw the menu, I realized this place is another Korean-owned Japanese restaurant.</li><li>The place was n't even half full.</li><li>I hate giving a negative review but someone needs to realize this place needs a lot of improvement if it wants to survive: (.</li><li>I am very critical and picky about my sushi places and have been to a thousand of them, and this place is always fantastic ( have been about 30 times by now).</li><li>We were seated quickly, as the place was n't packed, but busy.</li><li>Service was fairly quick- this place is Korean-run so they had those service buttons that authentic Japanese restaurants may not have.</li><li>I am giving this place 3 stars considering this place does not provide freebies when you sit down and ordered.</li><li>This place is a pretty decent size.</li><li>The place is not usually busy, but the service is always slow.</li><li>After we parked we could n't find the restaurant ... and walked pass the front doors of this place a few times because they do n't have an Ichiban sign on the front!</li><li>I have been here on a couple of occasions but I never found this place to anything out of the ordinary.</li><li>It 's safe to say the place is nice and accommodating but it 's a little on the $ $ $ end.</li><li>I would stay clear of this place.</li><li>The place is kept clean, even though there are a few chairs and tables that could be replaced as the overuse of them can be seen and felt when sat on or touched.</li><li>Clean place.</li><li>Always love this place ...</li><li>The negatives: Nasty customers who know how to destroy a pleasant ambience- have their speaker-phones on their cell phones ( loudly) in a quiet sushi place.</li><li>Like the ambience even is a small place is cozy.</li><li>I tried this place out for lunch.</li><li>I definitely recommend this place.</li><li>The place is a bit small, if only me and my husband go, we dont have to wait but with my 3 kids, always wait for 10-15min.</li><li>You sha n't regret it. having heard that this was the original st.louis, and i love st. louis, i thought this place was going to be amazing. i got the weekend special which came with wings, fries, jalepeno poppers and chicken strips.</li><li>It 's a very simple place but the wings always keep me coming back!</li><li>This place is always my first choice when I 'm craving a pint and some wings.</li><li>I just love this place.</li><li>The place is full of regulars, its great to catch a game, with a beer and wings.</li><li>I 've checked out this place earlier this week after reading the good reviews they posted on their Window.</li><li>I highly recommend this place to any wing and burger lover around the globe!</li><li>If you love tiny dry burnt wings, cold undercooked frozen fries, terrible domestic beer, and dozens of Rob Ford articles on every wall, then you will absolutely LOVE this place!</li><li>If you just want a simple Blizzard or soft-serve, this place is perfect, but like I said, just a simple Dairy Queen.</li><li>Staff are friendly despite them being super busy. amazing breakfast/brunch place, easy access, free parking infront, on sunday before 1pm. great services, food was unbelievable good. huge portion for the price.</li><li>Need a relaxed place to sit, enjoy good food and linger to play catch up.</li><li>The breakfast special is priced very well ( especially before 11am for 4.99) however the menu is a but on the pricey side for a diner. the food quality and taste, did however make up for this. its a great little place to pop into for a more gourmet style diner food experience.</li><li>This place is consistent for all day breakfast or lunch and this neighborhood just got a whole lot more desirable still.</li><li>Overall: I really enjoyed the experience and can see why people like this place a lot.</li><li>I love this place .. all day breakfast is great and service is out of this world !! my server, both visits, remembered everything about my order from the time before which was about a month prior ..!</li><li>If you are looking for a great brunch/breakfast place then this place is well worth it!</li><li>Yes, because this place is quite small, it can get quite busy.</li><li>For those who do not want to go through a complete review, let me start by saying I love this place.</li><li>It seems out of place, being a reasonably-priced diner in a trendy part of town.</li><li>This place is a bit pricey for breakfast.</li><li>As she described the flavor of the salmon and the quantity, I would sum it with it was worth every penny as for the egg Benedict, if you love breakfast as much as I do and love a non strong mustard or non creamy hollandaise, you will love this place.</li><li>The place was clean and the waitress was friendly.</li><li>Lastly, as previously mention, this place does n't take credit cards which means they should probably move to a more remote location if they feel like scamming taxes.</li><li>A nice place to come to breakfast Pros: Nice place for breakfast Friendly service Cons: If you 're not there early, expect to wait a while for a table Cash and debit only We came in early on a Saturday morning.</li><li>The place was half full already.</li><li>The place was practically full the time I went in the morning.</li><li>This place is definitely worth the far drive for breakfast.</li><li>Great little place, food was good and prices reasonable.</li><li>This would be fine, since it 's definitely a `` nicer'' place, but these `` nicer'' places usually step it up a bit with a nice garnish of fruit or beans or something like that ( see George St. Diner, The Senator).</li><li>What really adds to the charm of this place is the service.</li><li>This place is roomy.</li><li>Anyways, this place has been frequented by me a lot and I even had one of my birthday dinners here last year.</li><li>Overall, this place is okay if I 'm super desperate for sushi.</li><li>Good place, lots of seating, really clean.</li><li>I like this place because not too many places offer my favourite kind of sushi ...</li><li>The place itself is actually pretty nice inside and there is a sushi bar ( like most places), where you can watch the guy make the sushi I ordered a krab roll with a Beef Don.</li><li>This place is quite spacious, and the time we went they were not busy, so they were attentive to our needs ( not that we had any).</li><li>I like the place not for the quality, but for the price.</li><li>So in other words, I am definitely a fan of this place.</li><li>For the rest of the reviewers: I think a little slap of reality in the face is needed for you guys, because honestly, this place is not really a five star quality restaurant and we all know we 're just paying like chump change for the food their serving.</li><li>Nice place, friendly people, good food!</li><li>The place was really clean and the waiters were really friendly.</li><li>I highly recommend this place.</li><li>If you 're in the area and a fan of Philippine cuisine, this place is worth a try.</li><li>I will always recommend this place!</li><li>This place is always packed for meal time.</li><li>If u want a place to sit comfortably and chat with ur friends, probably this is not an ideal place.</li><li>Casual place- great for lunch.</li><li>For me though, this place is decent but not mind-blowing.</li><li>Overall, the service is fairly quick given how busy this place is ... and they are always very busy, so expect at least a 10 minute wait if dining on the weekend.</li><li>The place does get packed, we waited for about ten minutes which is not a bad wait time.</li><li>I recommend this place to anyone who might be in the area.</li><li>Popular place!</li><li>Love this place!</li><li>From a price and value perspective, this place is great.</li><li>Huge fan of this place.</li><li>However, it may be difficult to get the server 's attention because the place gets pretty busy.</li><li>Ive introduced this place to all of my friends and none have ever complained about the soup or service.</li><li>Well, this place does n't sell pork bone soup.</li><li>Great place in the winter to grab a quick meal to warm yourself up.</li><li>This place is always packed for reason.</li><li>The place was packed full of customers.</li><li>The place is n't really baby friendly since the bathrooms are located downstairs and there 's no place to change the little one, but they were totally okay with me carting my big stroller in and plunking it next to our table and letting me take up a chair for the car seat.</li><li>There is a lot of salt per serving, so my date with this place is once a year.</li><li>The place is small and sitting by 2 we basically shared a table with the people next to us.</li><li>This place is always crowded and has a long line.</li><li>Great place!</li><li>This place is always the same.</li><li>Solid place.</li><li>There was a huge line though, but i think because this place might be somewhat new and people go for the name.</li><li>When it 's cold outside, this place will warm you up.</li><li>I 'm giving this place 3 stars to be nice because the food was pretty good but with the abhorrent service and complete lack of communication skills by the wait staff severely impacted our meal- and could possibly have posed a health risk for my allergic friend.</li><li>This place is already so awesome and famous what else can I say !!</li><li>The place is small and the lineups are long during meal hours.</li><li>The place is nice and clean inside with air conditioning ( thank God- real scorcher at the time).</li><li>Overall, nice and comfortable place to be!</li><li>I strongly recommend this place to anybody looking for a quick Korean fix at a reasonable price point.</li><li>I love this place.</li><li>Still wonderful place.</li><li>If your into Korean soups/stews this is the place to be, especially on a cold winter day.</li><li>The place speciality is their tofu based Korean dish their other dishes are also a must try, the place is over all welcoming and will unquestionably give you taste of Korea while making Koreans nostalgic for a meal from home.</li><li>There is a reason why this place is always packed.</li><li>This place is always busy but I find service always courteous.</li><li>It 's too bad this place is really going downhill with every visit.</li><li>Overall one of my favorite Korean spots in North York. love this place! friendly environment, reasonable price and delicious soup! the only thing they could work on is perhaps on the decorations inside the restaurant, but when the food is so good and fast, who cares if the walls are bare.</li><li>Love this place.</li><li>It seems this place is quite popular as it is fairly crowded.</li><li>The place is tight, loud, and messy.</li><li>If u r a Korean grew up eating Korean food, you 'd know that this place is n't that great.</li><li>This place is just as good as the Christie location.</li><li>This place was jam-packed at noon on Sunday and with good reason.</li><li>I do n't like this place that much, maybe a 2 star.</li><li>We 've tried tofu dishes elsewhere too, but no apparently this place is the best.</li><li>Place is almost always busy.</li><li>If you like tofu, you 'll love this place.</li><li>Unpopular opinion, but I did not like this place.</li><li>The place has the usual soon tofu, bibimbap and a soup/grilled bulgolgi.</li><li>Unlike places that boast that they have over 100 or even 300 items on their menu, the fact that this place is about 10, you know that each item will be their very best.</li><li>This place is famous for the spicy soups but I keep getting the #9 broiled beef with stone pot rice.</li><li>Memories of Japan used to be a nice place to eat dinner but, with the way it 's going now, I would rather just go to another restaurant.</li><li>Given all the choices Toronto has to offer -- better Japanese food, or equal-quality food for less money -- I am surprised this place is still in business today.</li><li>I LOVE this place.</li><li>The place is usually packed on weekends.</li><li>He barely spoke a lick of English ( this place is run by Chinese), barely had any tricks, and worst of all- WORST OF ALL- his onion volcano, the one that normally shoots out a lovely plume of fire, was shit.</li><li>For a place not very busy on a Friday night I give this place under six months.</li><li>I 'm amazed this place is still in business and that it is getting good ratings.</li><li>I 'm not giving this place 4 stars just for the food.</li><li>This is not a place to go for a date, it 's the place you come to when you do n't care about impressing anyone.</li><li>I LOVE this place.</li><li>This place was n't the best, but it was still okay!</li><li>The bad:- The teppanyaki chicken was a bit undercooked;- They charge for pop refills;- They twice forgot to bring out an appetizer our party had ordered ( and the place was n't even that busy)- Our cook told really bad misogynistic jokes.</li><li>The place looks essentially the same as it did over 10 years ago, but it 's not a bad thing as it has a kind of peaceful and quiet decor.</li><li>One thing to note is their washrooms are way too small for the size of this place!</li><li>If you do n't mind waiting ridiculous amounts of time, even when you 've made a reservation, while an unapologetic host ignores you then this is the place to go.</li><li>Working in Yorkville, this place is a lunch time staple and a welcome addition to the overpriced alternatives scattered throughout the Bay-Bloor area.</li><li>Chino Loco 's still KILLS, SLAUGHTERS actually, this place and the Church location is only a 15 min walk away.</li><li>Good place to go to satisfy a craving.</li><li>Nice affordable place.</li><li>The place is kind of expensive I ordered spegetti and it was $ 15, a beer was $ 5, and it was n't all that great, I have n't had a lot of italian food but I have definitely had better.</li><li>This place is FANTASTIC!</li><li>Wow, with 3 locations in the GTA- how had I never heard of this place before ?</li><li>I could n't believe how huge this place is!</li><li>Love this place.</li><li>This place is open till 11pm every day, popular with the locals, with a high noise level from all the different conversations going on around you.</li><li>I have to say I was NOT prepared for how amazing this place was.</li><li>This place is highly underrated !!</li><li>This place is `` safe'' as there 's something for everyone.</li><li>Given Toronto 's culinary breadth and depth, this place becomes an afterthought or not-thought-of-at-all too easily.</li><li>The set up the place is kitchy, and different, but it has n't changed in 10 + years, when it first opened as Movenpick Marche, before the dispute.</li><li>But this location is a noisy, drafty place, not unlike an airport cafeteria, with bad music blaring loudly.</li><li>Could n't agree more with the previous few posts- this place is OVERPRICED with LOUSY SERVICE and they have the temerity to charge a 10% gratuity for self-serve!</li><li>Great place to hang out and drink, do n't come here if you expect good food ...</li><li>Good place to go.</li><li>The place is pretty nice and cozy.</li><li>Overall a great experience. i was sooo offended. as the manager of a bar, i understand some things take time, but being rudely greeted by the bar staff and ignored for 10 minutes while they do nothing is pretty bad to begin. having the barstaff whispering to each other while blatantly pointing at my friend is obscene. we asked to move to a table. they said fine, no one brought us menus or asked us if we wanted drinks. the bitchy blond bartender walked right by the table 4 times, making a point of not looking at us and cleaning tables right next to ours, yet still ignoring us. then she walked to the edge of the bar and twirled her hair for a bit, all the while making sure not to make eye contact with us. we finally went over to the bar and asked the guy if we could get menus or drinks or service, explaining to him that we have been waiting for ten minutes, when he rudely informed me that i had only been waiting 20 seconds. so i asked for the bill from our drink at the bar, had my tip rudely returned to me, amid more whispering and pointing at us. im disgusted and quite upset about being treated like that, especially because i used to be quite a regular there, and im a big tipper and very polite ( dont forget i manage a bar, and it should be all about customer service). i wouldnt recomend this place to anybody for any reason. maybe a different location, not this one.</li><li>Unlike most of the comments here, I 'm not going to find fault in the food or the prices of this place.</li><li>This is THE place I go to for pasta.</li><li>One of the owners of this place ( Jim Treliving) also owns Mr. Lube and can be seen on the Canadian TV show on CBC Dragon 's Den.</li><li>AWESOME late nite/ 24 hr KALBI TANG or KAMJATANG place is a lil dirty, service is slow, but for 3 am yum at a decent price this place is the place to be in north york ( even though the selection of late night places in the area are very slim- subway is open till 3am across the street) i give them props for dealing with all the drunken stupers though, who roll in there wanting some home style korean! kimchi is very spicy! i choke everytime. hahaha, but they do give you as much as you want.</li><li>AWESOME late nite/ 24 hr KALBI TANG or KAMJATANG place is a lil dirty, service is

place is near the bottom of my list of korean restaurants in TO.</li><li>This place is kind of a last resort for me, but among last resorts ..</li><li>I 'd definitely come back, the place is nice and cozy and the staff are polite.</li><li>I like coming here for a quick sit-down place.</li><li>The place is very convenient when I want something quick.</li><li>With mini Korea Town ( Yonge and Finch area) being filled with Korean restaurants, this place is actually pretty cool.</li><li>Definitely not a fancy place but if you 're coming back after a night of clubbing or are just really hungry and want to have a drink you can get it here.</li><li>The place is kinda small and little run down.</li><li>Too bad my old go-to place Sogong-Dong Tofu House is gone now, though based on the more recent reviews it had gone downhill too.</li><li>I like this place because it does all 4 consistently.</li><li>Let me start off with saying that before I went to this place, i did n't really dabble my palate in Korean Food.</li><li>The place doesnt have a lot of food choices and I often order the kamjatang ( pork bone soup) Overall is good I think, although dont expect too much side dishes.</li><li>This place is usually pretty full during peak time, but otherwise there wo n't be a wait.</li><li>Its a very casual place, which was nice for what we were looking for but its a lot more casual than places I would normally go.</li><li>Love this place.</li><li>The restaurant is in dire need of a facelift, the oldness makes it look dirty even though I think the place is pretty clean.</li><li>First of all this place is in dire need of some renovations.</li><li>You can tell I really do n't like this place.</li><li>I recommend this place XD.</li><li>Overall experience was an epic fail, from their un welcoming staff, there 's this old lady that was very rude, she did even bother to greet, their place is a mess, it stinks and their food is over priced compare to other korean restaurants thats clean, cozy and accomodating ..</li><li>The place is always packed so service is quick.</li><li>The place did n't look very clean or inviting.</li><li>First and foremost, this place is open 24/7 so whether you are with your family or you are drunk with your friends, this place is 101 comfort food.</li><li>First and foremost, this place is open 24/7 so whether you are with your family or you are

took my take-out order.</li><li>Food is served fast, the place is clean, there 's nothing remarkably good or bad.</li><li>The place could use a reno.</li><li>The place was busy on a Sunday afternoon and so that was a good sign.</li><li>I ca n't say enough about how good this place is.</li><li>He didnt even apologize, let alone offer something for the inconvinience. this place is officially banned on my list. im suprized they are still in business !!!</li><li>The place was fun to be at but the food pretty much sucked.</li><li>I would not recommend this place.</li><li>This is a great value-for-money place that is great for groups.</li><li>Somehow within that 15 mins, this place was filled.</li><li>Granted, this place is very busy, so maybe I 'm missing something, but I 'm not the biggest fan of this place.</li><li>Granted, this place is very busy, so maybe I 'm missing something, but I 'm not the biggest fan of this place.</li><li>This place is consistent.</li><li>I always passed by this place, but never went inside it.</li><li>The place was busy but still had empty seats.</li><li>If you like the place, on your first visit buy a VIP card that is valid for 1 year and costs $ 20.</li><li>I love this place.</li><li>Get there early because this place is busy.</li><li>Not the quietest place, but good for family/group gatherings.</li><li>The place looks like a dump, the staff looks like they are freshly paroled from prison, and the sausage sandwich was completely unimpressive, but that 's no matter, because the hot veal sandwich with cheese is still excellent, and well worth the trip.</li><li>I. I must say this is the best place to a veal sandwich.</li><li>Highly recommend this place.</li><li>The place itself is completely run down, always get the food to go.</li><li>The place is pretty much a dump or whole in the wall ... but is n't that what you want in a `` dive'' ... those are the best places for good food!</li><li>The place may look like a dive, but it just adds character!</li><li>This place is absolutely disgusting.</li><li>The place defiantly has a lounge feel to it.</li><li>The place was shabby.</li><li>Like many other reviews, I am too on the border of giving this place between a two star and a three star.</li><li>Because this place is near my work, I do n't think of this place anything other than a work-lunch place ( if I have time).</li><li>The place was packed and my friend thought the place is classy.</li><li>The place was packed and my friend thought the place is classy.</li><li>Went on a Saturday night, the place was very busy.</li><li>But if you are looking for dinner, this place is okay but not the best.</li><li>If you 've got time for a sit-down lunch I think this place is a great option. this has been my go to dessert place for the last 10 years.</li><li>Great place to go on a first date or to catch with family.</li><li>Having been informed that this place is under brand new management, I was invited to try this place out from my usual spots of Joon 's or Nome Izakaya across the street!</li><li>Good place, and the only breakfast place in the area.</li><li>This place is reasonably priced and you get what you pay for, nothing more nothing less.</li><li>The place is not the cleanest diner I 've been to, and could definitely use an update.</li><li>I love this place.</li><li>Whether it 's a hot veal, steak, or chicken cutlet sandwich this place has the right stuff.</li><li>The place itself is well layed out.</li><li>This place is quite AWESOME.</li><li>If this place were a licensed restaurant, I would be there weekly.</li><li>BBQ whole chicken is very good, i also try they chicken place sandwich grilled, it taste so delicious, I recommend this place.</li><li>I totally forgot about this place!</li><li>I took a chance after reading other people 's reviews of this place.</li><li>Im mad at the reviews that were not so favourable for this place because you prolonged my visit ... that being said this place is small and simple but the meal i had was amazing, 10 bucks for a chicken piled club sandwich with fries it was very good ... i cant wait to go back and try more things on the menu ... these guys do it old school and thank god.</li><li>This place is small but you can dine in to eat.</li><li>The place itself is located around nowhere.</li><li>The place, I believe, is run by a small group of Koreans, and they were real friendly.</li><li>The place has three tables that each seat 4 people so the place is quite small.</li><li>If you 're a fan of this mix and match, you 'll probably like this place:).</li><li>The wontons though are the highlight of this place.</li><li>This place is a hidden gem.</li><li>Usually love this place, as long as you 're ordering an omelette.</li><li>Although this place offers a gluten sensitive page on their menu, which means there are items in the menu which you should be able to order from, ( with fine print targeted at celiac suffered- which I made clear that I was not) the waitress will refuse to take your order and will leave you sitting there while the rest of your group sits and enjoys their meals!</li><li>From first impression to the very last, this place was a zero!</li><li>The place was nearly dead, and yet so messy and in cared for.</li><li>The place looks poorly maintained, the tables who have finished eating and were long gone were cluttered with dishes and trash on the tables, even once the place was n't busy at all!</li><li>The place looks poorly maintained, the tables who have finished eating and were long gone were cluttered with dishes and trash on the tables, even once the place was n't busy at all!</li><li>Long story short this place is a complete joke and I will never step foot in it again!</li><li>I surely recommend this place to anyone who wants to try traditional Korean cuisine.</li><li>The place was kinda packed during rush hour and they did n't have enough waiter/waitress to serve everyone.</li><li>The place was clean with comfortable booths, so other than the service it had a nice ambiance to it.</li><li>I LOVE THIS PLACE!</li><li>It has been our go to place every now and again ... but after the last time, my dining companions and I will be boycotting this place.</li><li>Everything we have ordered here was very good, the place is tidy and nice inside and it is busy during lunchtime for a reason and full of Koreans ( always a great sign) ...</li><li>This place is quite large, given the store-front.</li><li>I had always wanted to check this place out after I saw the neat looking plastic food models for some of the dishes displayed on window; a common practice which is mostly seen at many Japanese restaurants.</li><li>Definitely would not recommend this place to anyone.</li><li>Love this place.</li><li>Read my review below, and you 'll know I love this place.</li><li>Altogether this place is pretty inexpensive.</li><li>OVERALL HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE FOOD IS REALLY GOOD!</li><li>They are open until 2am so if you feel hungry in the middle of the night that 's the place to go.</li><li>It was n't too busy on a Sunday evening but the place does get busy on weekend evenings.</li><li>The place is quite small, the décor is nothing special at which is probably one of the few areas where it loses points.</li><li>This place is the best for lunch.</li><li>Plus this place is open till late at night, so if you have a craving for Korean food, this is a good option.</li><li>Ugh, it 's so unfair how I crave korean food almost every day now because of this place.</li><li>One noteworthy mention is their free side dishes; from all the Korean joints I 've been to, this place has the biggest selection of side dishes and they all taste pretty good.</li><li>It really appears like the management is trying to squeeze the last drop of this place.</li><li>The place is very clean with modern decor and the bathrooms are clean too.</li><li>This place is a nice and healthy change to the other fast food chains on the block.</li><li>Overall, this place was disappointing in flavour and in their customer service.</li><li>Would not recommend this place when there are so many better places!</li><li>I love/hate this place.</li><li>Foods good but the place was VERY busy.</li><li>If you want delicious meals with big portions for cheap, this is the place!</li><li>Ambiance is weak and plaza/ neighbourhood is n't great which is probably why this place does n't get love.</li><li>Nonetheless, this place is a good find.</li><li>I was going to write a nasty review about how expensive this place is in comparison to other Persian restaurants around it but Trout 's right.</li><li>The only reason I 'll go back to this place is to try the ghormeh sabzi ( another basic persian food), so that I can add or remove another star from the review! 3.5/5- this place is usually friend and my go to place for Persian food.</li><li>The way they are sneakily putting in appetizers and bringing out whole cakes instead of slices- I would never return or recommend this place.</li><li>If you are looking for a quiet place to eat this is not your place to go.</li><li>I wanted to like this place because the service is friendly but the burgers are just not any good, especially for the price.</li><li>Place is usually clean and organized.</li><li>Perfect place to satisfy my `` I-need-to-get-out-of-my-office-and-eat-a-fresh-outta-the-oven-pizza'' cravings.</li><li>Sometime the place could use a bit better clean-up.</li><li>Place has been sold!</li><li>Place looks nice, casual.</li><li>Lovely cozy place with yummy sushi.</li><li>I 'm sorry, this place was disappointing just as their exterior restaurant design shows they do n't put much care or effort to running their business.</li><li>All You Can Eat Sushi places are great but this place does n't live up to the expectations of a vegetarian, your options will be very limited, I think I only had 5 things that I could actually eat from the menu.</li><li>This place is excellent- at least it was when I used to live in the condo 's upstairs and would come down for their all you can eat buffet, made to order.</li><li>It 's a very small and dark place, which makes it a very depressing place, there was n't even any background music.</li><li>If you 're into fancy looking sushi places with good food, this place is for you.</li><li>The place is clean and well kept.</li><li>Overall unless you get sushi instant craving and/or urge and it is closest to place to yours, I recommend to go other place to get better experience with the similar price.</li><li>The place itself is real small, as well as for the menu ( for lunch at least).</li><li>I 'd recommend this place.</li><li>I do not recommend this place.</li><li>The place was clean, the music was pleasant, and there was a lot of room.</li><li>This place is right in my backyard and I 've been walking past it for a number of months.</li><li>The place is not big but they had 3 people working the floor and seemingly working each table.</li><li>The place itself is n't the biggest but knows how to make serving their clts #.</li><li>You can normally judge how well a restaurant does dim sum by ordering their haw gows and siu mai 's, and this place does them well.</li><li>Compared to some other noodle places near Yonge and Finch, this place is somewhat bigger ( I 'm talking on the scale of 25 seats vs 10), but it can fill up fast.</li><li>This place is also open 24 hours which is awesome.</li><li>Well today was the day that I randomly remembered this place and on my way home decided to go and check it out.</li><li>It 's a very small place but has a nice mom &amp; pop feel to it, you can tell immediately that this is a `` neighbourhood spot'' and the staff pretty much knew most of the customers dining in there by name.</li><li>The place is nice.</li><li>If you love cheap eats, you will love this place.</li><li>So if you are a fan as well this place is definitely worth checking out.</li><li>Look- this place is $ 8 for lunch, taxes in.</li><li>First, be prepared- this place is very pricy.</li><li>This place is right on with it though.</li><li>If you are looking for a real authentiic sushi restaurant with great sushi fish, this is the place to go.</li><li>Amongst a sea of Japanese restaurants in GTA, this place stands out by offering authentic Japanese fine dining, pure and clean Japanese food, none of the fusion/innovative rolls that you 'd find in so called sushi restaurants in trendy neighbourhoods.</li><li>The place is very clean and nice &amp; quiet.</li><li>This place is definitely one of the priciest Japanese restaurants I 've ever been to, perhaps it 's because its in a hotel ?</li><li>I forgot about this place, but I used to come here a lot with I was kid, before the place became so pricey.</li><li>If you want a `` real'' and delicious burger, this is the place!</li><li>Pros: Burgers made to order Prices are good Cons: Place is really hot inside Burgers are frozen As soon as you walk into this place, you notice how hot it is inside.</li><li>On a hot summer day, this place will be a little uncomfortable fro some to eat inside.</li><li>I mean, this place is what it is- a fast-food Thai place.</li><li>Nothing is particularly special though, so this place does n't make it to the four or five star mark.</li><li>In my starving state and driving past this place I swung in to get some take out.</li><li>After we ordered it took only 10 minutes for our food to be prepared, which is nice since the place is pretty small and not much to look at inside.</li><li>This place may be near by but I 'd rather travel for better service.</li><li>I would not recommend this place.</li><li>This place is a disgrace to Pizza Hut and I keep getting the impression that they are trying to cut corners everywhere.</li><li>For how expensive their pizzas are and after tipping them and paying extra for dine-in, this place does n't deliver on quality and value.</li><li>The pizza was truly amazing, however, I would have given this place 5 stars if the pizza had that extra tomato sauce as it honestly was a bit lacking.</li><li>Place is clean and fancy yet not very pricy.</li><li>This seemed like a great idea as there were 2 of us that recognized symposium as an awesome dessert place ( Waterloo location).</li><li>All of the food is delicious ... however ... the vibe and atmosphere of this place is oddly confusing.</li><li>The place did n't look too crowded at the time we arrived however I found it took a little while for the staff to notice us and seat us.</li><li>The bad part about this place is n't necessarily with the chef, but with the ingredients they have.</li><li>I actually really like this place!</li><li>This place is newly opened, with a beautiful Renaissance mural interior, cozy chairs, and great ambiance.</li><li>3.5 STARS This place is a pretty good place to catch up with friends or have a first date.</li><li>Place reminds me of a nice coffee joint.</li><li>Nice intimate place.</li><li>Nice place, nice ambiance and above all good food.</li><li>This place needs some serious improvements.</li><li>The place was more than sufficiently staffed, however the service was horrendously terrible.</li><li>If you want a simple and causal but a place with nice decor, Symposium Cafe is where you go.</li><li>The food tasted as it always does .... but I 'll figure something else out next time! what is the deal with this mcdonalds ? i only go here because sometimes i work really late and its around the corner from my shop. they have the slowest service out of all mcdonalds ive ever been to. and on top of that, which i find ridiculous, they also charge more than other mcdonalds .. how ??? and when you get your order of fries, they NEVER fill it up, its always HALF. the food tastes as you would expect, but this place must be struggling financially to charge more than other mcdonalds, and only fill your fries HALF of what you should get. if you dont mind getting ripped off, then go here, otherwise go to the mconalds on keele just south of lawrence.</li><li>If you want to be sure you got what you order through the drive-thru ..... check every item in front of the server .... this place hardly ever gets an order 100% correct.</li><li>I have recently discovered this place, having a Latin American background I was happy to find it!</li><li>The place is small seat may be 10 people, take out is available, and all the backing is done on site.</li><li>I REALLY want to like this place but I really .. do n't We sat on the patio and it boasted `` authentic'' memphis style bbq. ... but then again, what place does n't try to boast authenticity nowadays ?</li><li>I REALLY want to like this place but I really .. do n't We sat on the patio and it boasted `` authentic'' memphis style bbq. ... but then again, what place does n't try to boast authenticity nowadays ?</li><li>I wish I could give less than 1 star ... this place owes me a few stars, in fact!</li><li>I DO love good BBQ but I am not being snobby, this place is really, really bad!</li><li>The place was plain but clean.</li><li>This was n't the worst place I 've been to but I would never go back, and I 'm just glad I did n't come without friends.</li><li>Contrary to the other reviews, I like this place.</li><li>But the pork was not smoked. this place did n't deliver the goods unfortunately.</li><li>Not surprisingly, this place is closed ...</li><li>A place I would recommend and will become a regular.</li><li>Great place.</li><li>The place is run by a husband and wife team who are friendly.</li><li>The restaurant is quite small seating only about 30 or so but it 's quite ' homey' and just a pleasant place to be.</li><li>The place is small and cozy but able to accommodate larger groups when needed.</li><li>On top of all this, the pretentiousness of this place is disgusting.</li><li>This place is decorated with blue and white trendy decor, and since its in Bayview village this place is pricier than your typical Chinese restaurant.</li><li>The meats were cooked well, however i found the pieces of green peppers over cooked. overall this place is A-ok .... first time, and probably last time.</li><li>I would not recommend this place.</li><li>Just FYI everyone this place failed DineSafe multiple times.</li><li>This place is small but extremely popular.</li><li>The place is designed more for pairs than larger groups.</li><li>The place was not too busy so it was a nice dining experience for us with servers ' full attention on us, but I left wondering why was this place not as popular as I expected it would be ?</li><li>It 's a small place, and so they may not be able to accommodate parties of more than six at one table.</li><li>-Decor is outstanding- Would n't expect such a beautiful place when looking on the outside- Service was awesome- Love the secluded sitting area.</li><li>As far as sushi restaurants go that are n't AYCE and $ 100/meal, this place tops it.</li><li>The place is n't too big and gets quite busy during lunch hours so go in the late afternoon ( lunch menu ends at 4pm by the way).</li><li>The employees were Korean, so am I safe to assume this place is Korean owned ?</li><li>Looking from the outside you would not think much about this place, it is an industrial area with lots of little storefront businesses.</li><li>From the first moment you walk in, you can tell, this place is quality and the people care.</li><li>Highly, highly recommend this place!</li><li>Love this place for lunch.</li><li>The place is very small and if you go during busy times you may wind up waiting quite a while.</li><li>I will recommend this place to any poor soul who works in the area or goes to York, as it is by far the best sushi option in the area.</li><li>This place is definitely one of the best sushi joints in the city !!</li><li>It 's a very small place, the decor is welcoming and the staff very attentive.</li><li>Otherwise this place is pretty good.</li><li>It is your typical chain style, bar food type of place.</li><li>I 've given this place a few tries but they always seem to be understaffed.</li><li>Great place to go for watching sports.</li><li>If you 're looking for a neighborhood sports pub this is the place! honey garlic chicken wings, that 's all I have to say.</li><li>The place was jam packed and we literally got the last table.</li><li>Our server was very nice and even though the place was busy checked on us time to time.</li><li>This place is very popular apparently and does get real packed so try to come in early if its a larger group as several people were turned away while we were there.</li><li>Great place with a good atmosphere.</li><li>Overall a great local place with a lot more personal atmosphere than other locations.</li><li>Good place, solid food and good service we go there a lot for UFC nights but try to go to the bar upstairs much better atmosphere than the ground floor, better service and even the food.</li><li>AMAZING place !!!!</li><li>Always friendly service and well executed dishes in a dated but comfortable environment, this place will be missed ( especially the pickles).</li><li>Yes, the place could use a renovation, plastic cups for sauces etc have to go.</li><li>Love this place, and it 's always packed.</li><li>xD Would n't recommend this place.</li><li>The place is a little bit in need of an update; the decor is not bad or worn out, but the patterned carpet just makes it feel dated.</li><li>A solid 3 stars for this place, which is fine when you do n't need to have fancy food.</li><li>I really like this place.</li><li>The place was bustling with people and the restaurant looked clean, modern and spacious.</li><li>The warm colored interior and slightly dimed lights created a cozy atmosphere, even though the place was almost packed and somewhat loud.</li><li>Huge place, has a buffet and ala cart; but never packed ??</li><li>This place is definitely a gem.</li><li>The place is extremely dirty, the food is questionably and definitely microwaved, and the servers did n't have their customer service training.</li><li>What a shame ..... and yes, the place was pretty empty ( Tuesday afternoon) This place needs to go back into its past &amp; rethink everything, what happened to that happy, light hearted atmosphere that was Wimpy 's ? ..... they went 99% of the distance with the decor .... but seriously, why unplug the Jukebox setup; really dumb- ( uh that kinda was the whole idea of having it there ....</li><li>Overall, if you are craving low quality diner food that is overpriced for what you are getting, this is the place to go.</li><li>The endless options of online games and the convenience of food at the same place. anyhow I happened upon this 24 hour diner. it was practically empty at 10pm but picked up and up, and soon at 11pm it was about half full. the food was well portioned, the potatoes were just ... meh not bad. but felt out of place taste wise. pretty good stuff.</li><li>If you wanna feel like dirt trash in the am come to this place, the surrouding Plaza with its ' interesting' ppl will get you in the mood.</li><li>The place is a diner so do n't expect a posh atmosphere.</li><li>The place was crazy-ass busy at the time, and there was a line-up out the door, but it was clear that this manager was keeping it together upstairs, and was calm and in control.</li><li>I was surprised to see how busy this place was, and it appears to have a committed group of locals that come here regularly.</li><li>I like this place, it 's small however so timing is important in order to get a table.</li><li>Love the cute old style diner vibe of this place.</li><li>I definitely recommend coming to this place, overall it is a good pace to grab a bite and catch up with friends!</li><li>I will come back and definitely recommend this place.</li><li>The Highlights:- This place is gorgeous both inside and out- Ample amount of seating for both small and big groups- The waiters are all very professional and seasoned in the food serving business ( you wo n't find your neighbor 's 16 year old kid working here)- Free hors d' oeuvres at the start of your meal ( pickles, olives, cottage cheese, and garlic bread)- Reasonable prices ( all main entrees come with a salad or soup of the day ... a good amount too)- Parking is a plenty and free- Desserts are made on site and delicious ... and you can get it for a low price- Bottomless coffee for $ 1.75- Quiet so you can carry on a conversation with your dining companions I will definitely be back.</li><li>The place had a very romantic era feel to it.</li><li>This place is nothing like the David Duncan House before.</li><li>For a fancy and expensive restaurant, I expect a higher customer service level and this place did n't achieve it.</li><li>First of all, this place is lovely.</li><li>Your granny will love this place.</li><li>I went here with my friends for New Year 's Eve to have our last dinner of the year together in a fancy place.</li><li>Not to put down any of the other reviews here, but this place is definitely overrated for the decor, service and $ $ $ $.</li><li>And the ambiance and decor make it an interesting place to bring people who have never been.</li><li>The place also has barbaque but I doubt that I would want that late at night ..</li><li>Possibly the worst place I have ever gone.</li><li>The atmosphere is nice and usually never quiet, since this place always has people out and about, and there is always kpop music playing in the background.</li><li>Overall, this place was alright.</li><li>A nice place to go when you 're out late, but not sure I 'd head to such a busy area when there is Korean food closer to home.</li><li>Seems like this place is good for table cooking but we were n't up for that.</li><li>This place does have Korean BBQ grills, but I have yet to try it.</li><li>The place was busy actually with customers.</li><li>This place is a classic example of where expectations are set but not met.</li><li>I would have been understanding had this been mentioned from the very beginning but as I 'm about to list the other faults of this place, you 'll see why my patience has run dry with them.</li><li>Service plays an integral role and from my consumer opinion, this place is understaffed and the poor service is a result of that.</li><li>Normally, if I 'm heading out for Korean food, I go to Nak Won next door or Narooe up the street but since I had n't tried this place yet, I figured I 'd give it a go.</li><li>This place is right around the corner from where I recently moved and a quick short walk from my condo.</li><li>This place had a lot of options and shit so many sauces to try that when i got to the sauce part of the area I just stood there confused.</li><li>However, this place was something of a mixed bag.</li><li>This place had a huge selection of foods including a pretty diverse selection of seafood; something the waterloo location was lacking.</li><li>Love the `` choose your ingredients and we cook it fresh for you'' side of this place.</li><li>I would definitely recommend this place.</li><li>It has been a couple years since I was last there, but this place is just so memorable that I wanted to write a review for it.</li><li>The place was very clean.</li><li>The icing on top of this place was the dessert selection, by the time i was due to go for a tour of the dessert tables I was feel full and kept it simple.</li><li>Edit: price wise, this place is only worth it during weekdays for lunch ( 12.99 as of 2014), but I 'd probably not pay 26 for dinner at this place.</li><li>The place is huge and high-ceilinged and when it 's full it gets loud.</li><li>Age of this place is showing.</li><li>A clean and comfortable place to go to.</li><li>It is a large place and had no problem getting a table.</li><li>But for a memorable and interactive dinner with special someone, I recommend this place.</li><li>The place is clean and modern with attentive waitresses who are always quick to clear finished plates and refill our drinks.</li><li>I like this place.</li><li>Anything less than 5 stars for this place is, I daresay, blasphemy Having grown up a few blocks from this place, I ate here almost on a weekly basis during my high school years.</li><li>Good place to go for communal eating ( order a bunch and share among).</li><li>Ok this place is no joke!</li><li>If I were on Foursquare, I 'd forever hold the throne of mayorship here, if I had the Yelp mobile app I 'd be the first and last person to check in here, and if I had a million dollars I 'd buy this place in a heartbeat.</li><li>Price per person: around $ 10 Summary: a cheap and tasty congee place Tip: call to book a table, this place gets pretty busy during weekend This is a typical good congee place in Toronto.</li><li>The place had never been renovated EVER!</li><li>Love this place!</li><li>Love this place!</li><li>It 's no surprise that this place is always busy for reasons 3- 5 above, no matter what time of day.</li><li>The place is loud, so be prepared to use your outside voice.</li><li>Busy Busy!: This place is busy during prime time because of it 's affordable menu and large portions.</li><li>However, this place is always busy ... should make reservation if you do n't want to wait in line.</li><li>This place is pretty awesome.</li><li>This place is hands down my favourite when it comes to eating Chinese food: it 's fast, it 's cheap and it 's good.</li><li>We visited this place twice on our vacation.</li><li>One of my clients suggested this place to me and I am glad I listened to him.</li><li>This place ALWAYS hit the spot for your HK tea cafe style needs.</li><li>It 's not really a gourmet kind of place.</li><li>Ok, I 've been trying to call this place to order takeout food as I 've done a ton of times before as they deliver.</li><li>Wow, this place was amazing!</li><li>When I told my friends back in DC of places I went, THEY knew about the place!</li><li>The place was clean and lastly, the meal was inexpensive!</li><li>This place is one of my favourite places to have dinner with the family.</li><li>Love this place.</li><li>I had high hopes for this place and was excited upon seeing and tasting my congee when it arrived.</li><li>The place gets incredibly busy at night because they are open late.</li><li>If you are in a rush and can get a seat, this place is fast!</li><li>The place itself is nothing to write home about.</li><li>This place is generally better.</li><li>I really wanted to like this place since it is right around the corner, but unfortunately I did not.</li><li>Anyone who is into fine dining and especially delectable French style bakery must check out this place!</li><li>Overall, this place is A-OK, I would come back all the time just for cake!</li><li>This is by far the best place I 've had for meringue in Toronto.</li><li>I 've gone here on several occasions and I 've felt compelled to write a review of this place.</li><li>When I 'm back in town, this place is a must for their meringue.</li><li>This place 's cake is a ABSOLUTE FAIL.</li><li>Cute cafe:) We came here just to grab some cakes to go so did n't stay, but definitely roomy enough to be a nice sit-down place.</li><li>This place, is all about their meringue cakes.</li><li>This is my local place to order Chinese.</li><li>This place is located in a strip mall opposite the science center.</li><li>All in all, for cheap and quick food with good portions and decent flavours, this place is certainly worth a try if you 're in the neighbourhood.</li><li>This place does n't have thE best bagels in the world, but there are a few key items which are fantastic- combined with friendly and polite counter service.</li><li>My fiancee LOVES this place, It must be something in their Greek Salad.</li><li>This place can burn in hell.</li><li>I will definitely not be coming back and would not recommend this place to anyone.</li><li>I highly recommend this place!</li><li>How is this place still running !?</li><li>Love this place.</li><li>No wonder this place closed!</li><li>When I got there, the place was pretty empty.</li><li>Like I said, Agra is an OK place to go.</li><li>The butter chicken at this place is the BEST in the city.</li><li>I must say this place also has the best home fries ever !!!</li><li>Love this place.</li><li>The place was super busy on a Sunday and the Line did not stop.</li><li>This place is a hidden treasure that I am happy my friend found.</li><li>Great place, great food, never disappointed and the price is cheap.</li><li>More of a 3.5 star place.</li><li>I usually do n't but the place smelled like them so I had to.</li><li>Here is how i would rate this place: Food: 3.75 the flavors were good it just did n't quite feel like we were having ramen compared to my other ramen experiences.</li><li>Out of all the ramen places that have opened recently in the GTA, this place is still my favourite!</li><li>I really like this place!</li><li>This place is very authentic as in Japanese traditional ramen houses.</li><li>Very small place, less than 10 tables.</li><li>It 's a really small place, so big groups might want to call ahead and make sure it 's not too busy.</li><li>I 'd say this is the place to go for Ramen time.</li><li>Really enjoy the dive-iness of this place.</li><li>The place was slightly tiny, so it was hard to get a nice seat away from the other people in the place.</li><li>The place is usually way too busy for one waitress ( even though it is quite small) and she ( usually a she) is always super stressed.</li><li>Nice place, good ramen.</li><li>This location is a much small place, parking available at the back of the business.</li><li>My friend recommended this place to me back in 2006.</li><li>This place is open late for the club goers and drunks who have late night munchies.</li><li>Go here past midnight and the place can be packed with all people from all age groups.</li><li>The place feels nostalgic for me, so I 'll always be drawn back in for a sub when the craving hits.</li><li>This place is part of the city.</li><li>This place usually has the Jays or Raptor 's game on the TV as you wait to have your sub built.</li><li>Look no further, this is the place to be.</li><li>Memories! back in high school my friends and i used to driver over here to grab lunch, the place has n't changed one bit:) i always order the Bacon Combo but make sure you ask for GRAVY! that 's a secret tip. what makes this sub so good ? everything! all the small details they add. the bread is nice and soft, lettuce shredded, bacon super crispy, and the friendly service you get everytime. they always make you laugh or smile.</li><li>Just ask for whatever you want because some toppings are hidden due to space, so do n't be shy. can you tell i love this place ? lol.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
