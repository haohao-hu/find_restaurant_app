<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 519' %><h2>fish tacos<br />occurrence: 9</h2><div><ol><li>We ordered 1 naked burrito, 2 fish tacos, and a small quesadilla.</li><li>I have read the other reviews and it sounds like the fish tacos may be the hit here but I will not be returning based on my experience and the proximity of superior options.</li><li>I had the fish tacos and she had chicken tacos.</li><li>My husband had beef enchilada and I had fish tacos.</li><li>For food we got the bean soup, Fish tacos, and enchiladas.</li><li>Definitely will get again Fish tacos were amazing.</li><li>We ordered 2 lbs of wings Garlic Parm and Hot sweet asian just like my girlfriend mhmmmm;) and the fish tacos cause who does n't like tacos right ?</li><li>But the fish tacos were a disapointment, but i mean who gets tacos at a bar and grill right ?</li><li>On the positive side, the Korean BBQ beef coleslaw sandwich and fries were really delicious ... i did n't even need to use their special garlic dill dip but i recommend ordering the dip with your fries to have a fresh change from ketchup sometimes. today 's soup was beef barley which was average as was the double amaretto sour however i was pleased they offered fresh options and could accommodate my off-menu drink request. final tip- do not order the nachos here. they were pretty bad ... happy i can always get great nachos at my joint fox n fiddle finch. hope the manager can fix the crappy service here because I 'd like to come back to watch a game and taste the fajita tacos, fish tacos or one of their tempting burgers. ok last last tip i dont know if i should write this but the servers are pretty so i guess that could be a plus for those who appreciate that sort of thing.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
