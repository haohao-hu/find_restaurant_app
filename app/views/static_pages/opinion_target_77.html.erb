<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 77' %><h2>table<br />occurrence: 103</h2><div><ol><li>Every table was seated.</li><li>Reservations are needed if you do n't want to wait for a table or sit at the bar.</li><li>My husband and I were seated at very comfortable table.</li><li>Does n't take long to get a table and our server returns often asking if we 're ok, or to refill drinks, bring napkins etc.</li><li>Of course at a Sushi Restaurant that is always a good sign if your waiting for a table ....</li><li>We went on a week-night, and contrary to the massive warnings about `` having to reserve a table'', we had no problem getting a table on the day of, and there were an ample amount of seatings.</li><li>We went on a week-night, and contrary to the massive warnings about `` having to reserve a table'', we had no problem getting a table on the day of, and there were an ample amount of seatings.</li><li>The sheesha was broken and our table was wobbly.</li><li>Note to self: Next time I 'm out on a Yelp event and Devan R. is seated at a table, I want the seat next to one of my newest fave foodies at Yelp.</li><li>The wait time to get a table was probably around 10 minutes and the wait time for our food was about 10 minutes as well.</li><li>I ordered a boneless goat roti and a Ting ( yeah, Ting!) to go since I was n't sure if I 'd get a table.</li><li>They sometimes get busy during prime lunch hours, but they always have a table available.</li><li>I requested a table in a quiet area and we got a nice table upstairs near the small bar.</li><li>I have visited the place more than 50 times and I keep wondering how they manage to always keep around the most professional of service staff, I took 4 of my office associates out for lunch and we each ordered a drink, an appetizer and a main course, waitress serving us memorized each of our orders without writing it down, while some upscale places have up to 3 people serving a table of five and would still manage to misplace or confuse an item or two per order.</li><li>When we first arrived, the host at the front did n't seem to care where to seat us ( assuming she did n't read the note, or read the note and did n't care), and we were seated at a tiny little 2 person table in the middle of 2 rows of booths.</li><li>She did n't ask us if we preferred a table or a booth.</li><li>We were able to get a table right away and they let us sit outside until close.</li><li>Fortunately, a table was leaving right when we arrived so we got a nice booth by the window.</li><li>Self serve on the coffee or drinks and grab a friend or a table and enjoy.</li><li>We booked a table 4 days in advance and when we arrived we were told that our table had been given away.</li><li>It was suggested that we sit at the bar until a table was available.</li><li>And why ca n't they stick to one server per table so that you can build a relationship with that one person and not have 4 or 5 different people come and ask you if you need anything and what not.</li><li>There was two ladies at a table when we arrived, very quiet.</li><li>The service is really really slow, but should be expected since the ginseng chicken needs to be cooked by the waitress 3 times per table, including all other tasks they have to do ( they look really tired) I have been here a few times and all at bad timings because the restaurant is always full, each time the waitress tells us it 's a really long wait and they do n't know how long, in a tune that they want you to not wait and just leave.</li><li>Service was good the waitress girl who served our table was nice.</li><li>The reviews on Yelp were accurate and you definitely need to make sure you either make reservations or get there early to get a table.</li><li>Came on a Saturday night just past 8pm, and waited around 15 minutes for a table for three.</li><li>On weekend dinners you we 'll most likely wait in line to get a table.</li><li>Within a few short months there was a line up just to get a table.</li><li>I pointed out a table for two that was open in the corner of the restaurant and she begrudgingly said we could sit there and that she would be by in a few minutes to wipe the table down.</li><li>I can always get a table here and the staff is really friendly.</li><li>The waiter just asked me 5 minutes ago whether I was with that gentleman that was seated at a table by himself, which means clearly he was allowed to sit and wait for his party.</li><li>The table was pretty small.</li><li>It was fairly busy on a Monday night but we got a table right away.</li><li>The prices were average for Korean food, the soups/stews ranged from $ 6.99- $ 9.99 and there were also options for hot pot and table top cooking.</li><li>Although our table questioned the lack of potatoes ( even when it said potato pork bone soup in Chinese on the wall menu) the waitress gave some weird explanation in English that no one understood.</li><li>The chef makes his rounds non-intrusively table to table to see if his guests are enjoying their food.</li><li>Make sure that you have plenty of time to sit at the restaurant during a busy Friday period and even reserve a table if possible.</li><li>Called up Linda 's and told the receiving end that we 're driving there right now and will be there in 5 minutes and asked if they had a table, SURPRISE SURPRISE- `` yes, we have a table right now''.</li><li>It was empty, only few table were occupied, which was great!</li><li>Also- who sits a couple and a baby and a table for two ?</li><li>My table ordered seafood congee, anchovy fried rice, and other dishes that I ca n't remember.</li><li>I highly recommend it if you can get a table.</li><li>Their table was SO close to ours like how hard is it to give us our food too ?</li><li>We waited for at least 30mins and all we had on our table was water ...</li><li>They tend to cook at one table and bring the pan to you later ... not cool: (- if you 're getting the entrees which they cook in front of you, you have to order 2 of the same dish which generally leads to less choice/variety- they only accept debit or cash I actually did n't realize this until lately, but what they cook in front of you can be easily replicated at home.</li><li>It 's small compared to those in Richmond Hill/Markham, but if you 're able to get a table it 's pretty good.</li><li>It is a tiny, tiny place with three tables however, one table is reserved to put takeout orders on so do n't try and sit there because you will promptly be told to move.</li><li>They have 2 table which seats 2 and 4 but it 's whoever comes first takes the seats.</li><li>We came here on a friday night for dinner, the place looks empty with only one table, luckily we were able to get a table to sit at.</li><li>It gets to the point, cuts out the overly indulgent decor, no wait staff, barely a table to dine-in, very small overhead costs.</li><li>If you go here on the weekend, you might have to wait for a while to get a table.</li><li>Went there the first time around 3pm, thinking it will be easy to get a table in between meals.</li><li>After 40 mins, no one ever called us, so we went back to check if they have table available, they said they never had our name/ number on the waiting list.</li><li>By this time, another couple had sat down at a table and had placed their order.</li><li>I saw a table for two receive their noodle dishes about 10 minutes apart because this idiot cook has no idea how to cook properly.</li><li>After a failed first attempt to land a table, the second attempt was not much better.</li><li>I will probably try other dishes but avoid trying to get a table.</li><li>What I do recall is waiting for a table at lunch ( about 15-20 minutes) and watching a lot of white and Asian people come out of the restaurant.</li><li>There were 8 of us at the table with room to spare.</li><li>My mom and my sister went in to grab a table while my other sister, dad and I tried to find a parking spot.</li><li>The place was busy so we shared a table with another patron which is fine.</li><li>However the table was quite small and made our eating space quite tight ... maybe we should have only ordered one type of dish.</li><li>Jook Sam Kyup Sal ~ squid spicy sauce with veggies, pork &amp; rice cake ~ Another type of table cooking, I love to munch on every thing here and rice is added at the end to make fried rice with the leftovers in the pot.</li><li>We had to walk all the way to the back of the restaurant and asked for everything that we needed, table, water, food .... our server wasnt friendly and got some attitudes.</li><li>Could n't get a table.</li><li>Your table is immediately set with a bottomless dish of crispy noodles and plum sauce for dipping, which is good for mindless nibbling.</li><li>Seating is super limited so it 's really hard to get a table if there 's a group of u.</li><li>I had to move a table over due to more people coming in for then to do a table merge.</li><li>I thought they would give us a 4 person table and just pull up a chair but instead they suggested for me to wait ...</li><li>Atmosphere: nothing special, table was not well cleaned Food: 1.</li><li>My meal began by seeking out a table not reserved or occupied ... the crowd this day was in the majority of Grandparents treating their offspring and children to a feast before their flight leaves to Florida .... or Hungary ... or the Baltic 's .....</li><li>Three wait staff were sitting snacking at a table near the entrance, in clear view of both the few diners present and the entrance.</li><li>Make sure you have a reservation, and come 10 minutes prior to your requested time so you get a table a.s.a.p as this place is often crowded around the dinner time rush.</li><li>I would go early, we had to wait a bit to get a table, but once you 're in service is super quick.</li><li>My friends and I came at a really good time because a table was just leaving.</li><li>Within 10 minutes the place was packed and there was a line up to get a table.</li><li>The place is small and sitting by 2 we basically shared a table with the people next to us.</li><li>Your only real concern is being able to get a table during busy hours.</li><li>A bit crowded when eating in and often have to wait for a table but food is delicious and fresh.</li><li>We arrived around 7:30pm and there was a short wait per usual, but we get a table relatively fast.</li><li>Each teppanyaki grill had eight seats and we were seated at a table with another family.</li><li>The 9 of us came by for a late dinner ( 12am) and lucky us, got a table immediately.</li><li>When we finally got in, we waited maybe 15 minutes before we got a table which was fine since turnover here is pretty fast.</li><li>It was a Monday evening around 6 p.m. and the restaurant was not packed so we got a table right away.</li><li>Nevertheless, we were lucky enough to score a table despite the owner having immense false insight that our bill would fall short compared to the group of beer thirsty fans behind us in line.</li><li>We called to make a reservation 15 minutes before arrival and they told us that the place was pretty empty- we should get a table with no problem.</li><li>We had to wait for a table which took maybe 15 minutes.</li><li>They are always busy but never packed ( except Sunday from 10-12) so we never have an issue getting a table and the service is always fantastic.</li><li>It was easy getting a table since it was relatively empty.</li><li>If you are staying in the adjacent Westin it would n't be a bad choice but do n't expect too much and if you are alone I 'd sit away from the grill and enjoy a quiet table with sushi.</li><li>We were waiting for a table to be cleaned.</li><li>I love their table cooking short ribs.</li><li>But if you come during off times, you can usually get a table pretty fast.</li><li>They just did not want me to occupy a table where they can serve 4 people instead because the rush was starting to poor in.</li><li>It 's just disappointing. one of the best st louis wings places. go on tuesdays, get a beer, wings are half price !!! i like cajun, hot, and original buffalo. first floor gets packed quick, so go upstairs, the music is better and you can actually get a table pretty quick. love it!</li><li>I like this place, it 's small however so timing is important in order to get a table.</li><li>If youre coming here on weekends or the holidays, booking a table might be a smart idea.</li><li>We irdered a mix of table and a la carte Table cooking Fresh beef ( looks and price loke wagu) $ 31 very small portion and not work the price Short ribs good but pricey at $ 30 Special Sliced pork belly $ 20 very good but I usually order the regular pork $ 17 ( best bet) A la carte Ka ja tang solid Bi bum bap good The side are a little better then the other korean place around and found the Noodle side dish with seasame oil excellent but they do offer free refill on that dish.</li><li>Did n't have a problem w/ seating and got a table right away.</li><li>We got a table relatively quickly, and were able to get our orders in.</li><li>Dirty table, no from a distance but sticky and not quite clean.</li><li>It can get packed but stick around for a bit and see how quickly you 'll get a table over those very large parties.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
