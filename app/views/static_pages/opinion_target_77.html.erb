<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 77' %><h2>wait<br />occurrence: 82</h2><div><ol><li>In this past year, I 've been there for 2 times. the most recent visit I took a few pictures, the sweet &amp; sour pork with the orange slices ( please see pictures) beside the S &amp; S pork, the 3 of us ordered the Kalbijim ( Beef Rib Stew) and the Kimchi fried rice. the banchan are good, wait, they are great.</li><li>Finally after 25minutes of wait ( reminder this is for lunch) with no tea or soup, I was able to place my order. somehow my waitress did not serve me tea-It 's something that comes with every Sushi restaurant so I didnt ask, after my sashimi got here with no tea, I could n't find my waitress again to ask her for it.</li><li>It is always busy but the wait is usually short.</li><li>It was the most uncomfortable wait ever.</li><li>It was definitely not worth the long wait and the price ( $ 15 for a combo).</li><li>Low and behold, my meal was very good, with a very short wait time as well.</li><li>There was a massive line up outside on the Sunday morning and the wait was well over 40 minutes but worth it!</li><li>It was packed but the wait was short.</li><li>The wait time to get a table was probably around 10 minutes and the wait time for our food was about 10 minutes as well.</li><li>The wait time to get a table was probably around 10 minutes and the wait time for our food was about 10 minutes as well.</li><li>Well worth the wait which seems pretty non-existent once your asked what you want.</li><li>If you contemplate ordering in increments, then be prepared to wait and the wait sometimes is lengthy.</li><li>I was expecting that perhaps they would offer us the food for free or even discounted due to the long wait but nada.</li><li>The wait was abit longer than I would expect to order but I suspect that these places it 's a given.</li><li>However the truth is it is basically a regular waffle, with oreo pieces and chocolate ice cream. literally the opposite. the star they lost was due to extremely long wait time for the deserts, and also the waffles false advertisement. overall service and environment is nice, and the food was decent, so its worth a try, but probably not on a day right before a weekend perhaps.</li><li>There 's a sign that said please wait to be seated so we waited but no one came.</li><li>The service was quite good and polite, but the wait was a bit long.</li><li>We came here after moto sushi had a 40 hour wait time.</li><li>The wait time here could be quite long compared to other sharwama joints, where I waited around 15mins for my food.</li><li>After a long wait, a waitress came from the kitchen holding an empty garbage can and placing it under her desk.</li><li>And after she took it back another woman came to my table and asked me if I ordered tuna ( yes) then another 10 minute wait to fix it.</li><li>They seat you down after you wait in a awkward line and then they hand you the menus.</li><li>Came here on a Sunday night and surprisingly, we had to wait but the wait was quite short.</li><li>The wait can be rather long, and the service sub-par.</li><li>The service is really really slow, but should be expected since the ginseng chicken needs to be cooked by the waitress 3 times per table, including all other tasks they have to do ( they look really tired) I have been here a few times and all at bad timings because the restaurant is always full, each time the waitress tells us it 's a really long wait and they do n't know how long, in a tune that they want you to not wait and just leave.</li><li>Arrived at noon and was told a 1/2 hour wait for our table of 5.</li><li>It gets busy even on weekdays so might be a wait ...</li><li>I rarely go to this part of town ( Bathurst &amp; Wilson) but I can see how people ( mostly Filipinos) do go out of their way and wait in line to eat here.</li><li>When she finally approached us, she said a huge crowd just came in, so the wait would be very very long.</li><li>And despite what other people have said, the wait was n't too long.</li><li>I usually avoid most BBT places during prime time so I never have any issue with long wait or lines.</li><li>The waiter then told me: `` Do n't sit, wait here please'' at the cashier.</li><li>This place can reach full house quick and you tend to get trapped in between herds of students but the rain made way to a line-free 2 minute wait to bubbletea #1 50% sweet and less ice.</li><li>Our server was polite and helpful, although towards the end of our meal, her service levels fell ( empty water glasses, long wait for dessert menu and orders).</li><li>Oh wait, they did made us wait for 10 mins.</li><li>My coworker told me that the restaurant is not usually busy, but maybe because it was a Friday, we were not seated immediately ( the wait was only about five minutes).</li><li>SERVICE NOTES I got my sandwich to go and the wait was pretty much the exact amount of time I 'd like to wait for a sandwich.</li><li>There was only one server but the wait was n't long and the food was super fresh.</li><li>The wait time was only 8 mins from order to table top.</li><li>This location is less crowded than the one in Thornhill, so you 'll have less of a wait, but it 'll still be at least 15 minutes for a table.</li><li>However, there have been occasions where the wait was too long so my friends and I left.</li><li>The wait can be awhile so I usually call ahead of time for takeout.</li><li>The restaurant is tight-spaced and pact however, the wait in line was decent and took about 10- 15 mins.</li><li>The place is a bit small so I can imagine that there is a wait time during prime hours.</li><li>There is n't much of a wait time, the chefs make the sushi fairly fast even when there 's a huge line.</li><li>The wait times are pretty crazy during peak hours.</li><li>Not sure if it 's worth lining up for if the wait is going to be more than 20min ... especially in the winter.</li><li>I recommend going in during non-conventional hours or expect a long wait, which I think is really not worth waiting for.</li><li>A few examples of things that could be improved:- The wait at the front door is usually quite long considering the number of open tables.</li><li>Once you pay you sit down with your number and you wait to be served.</li><li>The wait was n't too long.</li><li>The medium pho came first, but we waited a long time for the tendon pho and vermicelli ( a very very long wait, two tables that came after us got their food served before us.</li><li>Why did we have to wait to be seated when then were many empty seats and tables ???</li><li>If you 're looking for a place you can have a quick buffet meal, think of another place ... insulting me by making me wait to be seating in an empty restaurant is not usually what a buffet restaurant wants to happen ... usually be seated, served and leave is the way so they can turn over and seat more people.</li><li>We came on Mother 's Day and the wait was almost an hour.</li><li>Water was refilled without being asked and it was n't an absurd wait time for food.</li><li>Come early on weekends or expect a wait time.</li><li>The wait time for the food might be a bit longer than expected, but you can just use that time to bask in one of the better diner atmospheres in the city of Toronto.</li><li>It has lots of seating, so the wait was n't bad ( 5 minutes for 4 people) for a Friday night.</li><li>The wait was about 10 mins, every table was full, and most of the guests were of Korean descent.</li><li>The wait for our food was ok.</li><li>If you are coming here, do n't get a private room and expect a wait for a refill of tea.</li><li>The wait between dishes took quite a bit longer than most AYCE buffets I 've been to.</li><li>The wait time is AMAZING.</li><li>There was a little bit of a wait, but not bad at all.</li><li>Terrible service and ridiculous long wait for food.</li><li>The wait times on Friday and weekend nights can be quite long, do n't expect to get immediate seating if you come during dinner time.</li><li>The only downside is how busy they are, and thus, how noisy it can get so sometimes the wait can be quite long.</li><li>Although the line ups were there the staff were able to keep the line moving and serve everyone efficiently, that the line seemed to be constantly moving forward and the wait was really not an issue and lasted no more than 10-12 minutes.</li><li>Very satisfying. satay on the road has been one of my family 's favorite restaurants since i was a kid. i remember coming here when i was ten and ordering the same thing that i get now, ten years later: cashew nut chicken with an order of steamed rice and the shrimp chips with peanut sauce. first of all, the food tastes delicious. i think there 's been one or two times out of the hundreds of visits to this place where the food tasted a little spicier than usual but other than that, it 's been consistently amazing for close to a decade. i 've had cashew nut chicken at other thai restaurants and it just does n't compare. i ca n't speak about most of their other food but from what i 've experienced they 've been by far the best tasting thai restaurant in and around toronto. the wait staff is quick and friendly for the most part which is great. the atmosphere of the restaurant is nice ... they just re-did it and although i have to say i prefer the original decor which had an authentic thai feel to it, their modern, contemporary approach to their new `` look'' is very pleasing to the eyes and enjoyable to dine at as well. the value of the food is great. my girlfriend and i come here for their lunch special almost every week at least once and have a full meal with a drink that leaves us satisfied for both taste and hunger for usually under $ 10, 15% tip included. how can you beat that ? really. not to mention, you can order shrimp chips and peanut sauce as an appetizer while you wait for your meal, at no charge. i have yet to find another thai restaurant in toronto that has that. five stars to my favorite thai place since i was ten. i was happy to see that they expanded and opened another store on bayview. good for them!</li><li>Then you have to find a seat, sit down and wait to be called.</li><li>If you do n't want to be irritated with the long wait and bad service I suggest not To go.</li><li>Great place for wings and beers, but the wait is definitely not worth it.</li><li>The wait was 5 minutes and we sat down.</li><li>The wait times are a bit longer than other steak places and they often have poor service due to short staffed shifts during dinner rush.</li><li>The wait extended to more than half hour.</li><li>At any busy evening there are 30 chefs in the kitchen woking up seriously delicious Southern Chinese cuisines, there is never a long wait for food, and the consistency of quality is perhaps the reason why this location has thrived since inception.</li><li>I went here for lunch last week &amp; was annoyed cuz they made us wait for a table even though there were a few tables/booth avail!</li><li>The wait in line can be close to intolerable, so be prepared for it.</li><li>Needless to say, the wait was long.</li><li>It says that the wait is long and broth is bland.</li><li>Points off ( well, I 'm not actually taking points off, but downsides):- Limited seating- Sometimes the wait can be a bit long.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
