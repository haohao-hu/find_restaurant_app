<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1689' %><h2>pizza slices<br />occurrence: 2</h2><div><ol><li>The pizza slices are good, while the veal sandwiches are better. if you 're eating in, you 'll find the decor dated, but it 's part of the charm.</li><li>Definitely recommend for lunch or dinner ...... MILES better than PP or PH .............. its not the best looking restaurant but this family ( owners) are very nice and the pizza slices are generous and tasty ( the tastiest on wilson ave.) im a repeating customer. this my kind of a daily place Was hungry for pizza, looked up pizza delivery on yelp, read the reviews, and so I looked online for menu.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
