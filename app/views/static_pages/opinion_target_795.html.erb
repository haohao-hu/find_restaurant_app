<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 795' %><h2>lo mein<br />occurrence: 4</h2><div><ol><li>We ordered mushroom egg foo young, spring rolls, spicy eggplant in black bean sauce sauce with tofu, mixed vegetables, vegetable lo mein, vegetable fried rice, and mushroom egg drop soup.</li><li>Sauces were very thin, the spicy dish had no flavour, much less heat, and the lo mein was some type of ramen noodle with, again, zero flavour.</li><li>Good dinner combos, delicious lo mein, fabulous egglplant ( especially when paired with the fried rice), fresh when it comes to your front door, and there 's always enough for leftovers.</li><li>The Lo Mein was n't advertised as spicy, but they most certainly were.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
