<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1123' %><h2>Lamb Pao<br />occurrence: 4</h2><div><ol><li>On our visit, we ordered a Biang-Biang Mian ( hand-slapped and pulled ribbon noodles, stewed beef, sauteed tomato fried egg, and mixed vegetables) and a Lamb Pao Mo ( lamb stew, bean sprout, organic cloud ear mushroom, tomato, ground garlic, ginger and scallion with hand pulled noodles stir fried in wok, finished with house special marinara sauce) plus wood ear mushroom to share.</li><li>We got the Yo Po Biang Biang Mian, the Soy Stewed Beef Noodle Soup and Lamb Pao Mo. I would highly recommend the Biang Biang Mian and Lamb Pao Mo. These are both authentic Xi' an cuisine, and both are made very well at Artisan Noodle.</li><li>We ordered the pork jia-mo, the cold noodle, and the lamb pao mo ( sweet potato starch noodles).</li><li>But my go to is the Szechuan Cold Noodles and for soup noodle the Lamb Pao Mo. Also I would highly recommend the Bon Bon Chicken.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
