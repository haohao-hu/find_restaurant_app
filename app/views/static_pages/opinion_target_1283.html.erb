<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1283' %><h2>lunch break<br />occurrence: 3</h2><div><ol><li>I looooooove thai food ... not in spring rolls though ... it 's ok to come here for food on a lunch break maybe or while waiting for the movie at the cinema ... but not the ultimate food destination. what makes me put 2 starts is not even quality or authenticity of food but the smell of fried cheap oil that surrounds this restaurant whenever you pass it on the street ... there is also a hint of that smell inside in some parts of the restaurant ... other spring rolls locations would probably get a higher rating from me.</li><li>I 'm sorry but I do n't have time to wait 20 minutes to come to the restaurant when I 'm on a lunch break.</li><li>But I would n't recommend this place for anyone not looking to get fired for an afternoon-long lunch break.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
