<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 410' %><h2>fish balls<br />occurrence: 9</h2><div><ol><li>My friend and I ordered- steamed xo sauce pork neck rice: a little bland, and came with a bowl of cooked lettuce in soy sauce ...- stinky hot pot: really good, with intestines, pigs blood, enokie mushrooms, fish balls, and fish cake- mixed vegetables and tofu dry pot: it was okay- herbal essence jelly in coconut milk: awesome- mango freeze: she said it was awesome The decor is nice, the service is unfriendly.</li><li>It has shrimps, cuttlefish, fish balls and even 1 fresh mussel.</li><li>Food: The selection is pretty standard, a lot of fish balls, vegetables, lamb, beef slices and a seafood option that includes 1/2 lobster.</li><li>First time I 've tried Fried Fish Noodles and it 's not bad realizing Chiu Chow is famous for their Fish Mousse items such as Fish Balls.</li><li>The noodles were flavoured with a soy and hoisin sauce with BBQ pork in it, and the seafood soup was perfect for the cold weather outside with pieces of squid, shrimp, and fish balls floating around sprinkled with generous helping of chopped green onion.</li><li>2 shrimps, 2 fish balls, and 2 slices of squid.</li><li>Overall, its a good place to go if you are under a budget! so sad! this place is close! i used to come here but recently i realize that it 's been replace by a korean restaurant. the wontons are so filled with shrimp, the fish balls had bones in them i always get scared the bones might choke me but the food tasted awesome! hot water dispenser is at each table so you make your own tea. the soups tasted too much of msg ... delicious but ... msg is bad for you. bye bye wonton place, i kinda miss you. small portions, but i love how u can put your own oyster sauce into your noodles, instead of asking like other regular wonton noodle places. also enjoyed having a hot water faucet at my table. clean and good atmosphere.</li><li>Menu is small and focused on exactly what they do best- wontons, beef brisket, fish balls, wonton noodles, rice noodles etc.</li><li>The beef there was definitely on the lower end and the fish balls had bones in it.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
