<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 418' %><h2>seaweed<br />occurrence: 11</h2><div><ol><li>My problem is I find them to be a little snobby, the sushi sucks ( does not taste fresh seaweed always like rubber) and they are a little over priced on both drinks and food.</li><li>The seaweed that wrapped around the sushi was a bit chewy and some pieces were quite big to fit into one bite.</li><li>We had the mashed potato, kimchi, seaweed and sweet-sour radish.</li><li>I was super excited for the fried rice, because the menu says that at the end, they put the rice in for you, add sesame oil and seaweed, then mix it up with the remaining sauce and stuff at the bottom of your pan.</li><li>I could n't believe it ... 8 small dishes of banchan: Kimchi, glazed soybeans ( my absolute fav.), seaweed, japchae, odeng strips, bean sprouts, glazed sweet potato and pickled daikon.</li><li>My only complaint about the banchan was the seaweed and japchae were way too salty and the daikon tasted funky.</li><li>My favorite is by far the pork bone soup, it spicy and goes really well with the rice that they give you and the side dishes of bean sprouts, fish curd, kimchi, and seaweed.</li><li>You get small round dishes with bean sprouts, cold potatoes in gooey sweet sauce, glass noodles, kimchi, fish cakes, seaweed ( not like you get at sushi places, this one is saltier, with more of a sea-taste to it) and little bean dish.</li><li>The seaweed on the handroll did not have the typical crispiness, it was hard to bite off.</li><li>There was glass noodles, seaweed, kimchi, fish cake, bean sprouts, etc.</li><li>The side dishes selection was not as large as some other places, but they did have seaweed and fish cakes so I 'm not complaining.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
