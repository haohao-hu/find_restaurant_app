<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 8162' %><h2>barstaff<br />occurrence: 1</h2><div><ol><li>Overall a great experience. i was sooo offended. as the manager of a bar, i understand some things take time, but being rudely greeted by the bar staff and ignored for 10 minutes while they do nothing is pretty bad to begin. having the barstaff whispering to each other while blatantly pointing at my friend is obscene. we asked to move to a table. they said fine, no one brought us menus or asked us if we wanted drinks. the bitchy blond bartender walked right by the table 4 times, making a point of not looking at us and cleaning tables right next to ours, yet still ignoring us. then she walked to the edge of the bar and twirled her hair for a bit, all the while making sure not to make eye contact with us. we finally went over to the bar and asked the guy if we could get menus or drinks or service, explaining to him that we have been waiting for ten minutes, when he rudely informed me that i had only been waiting 20 seconds. so i asked for the bill from our drink at the bar, had my tip rudely returned to me, amid more whispering and pointing at us. im disgusted and quite upset about being treated like that, especially because i used to be quite a regular there, and im a big tipper and very polite ( dont forget i manage a bar, and it should be all about customer service). i wouldnt recomend this place to anybody for any reason. maybe a different location, not this one.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
