<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 555' %><h2>lobster sashimi<br />occurrence: 7</h2><div><ol><li>Ordered the lobster sashimi special, the unagi Don and sashimi salad, the sashimi salad was somewhat mediocre, lots of vegetables and not too much sashimi, the Unagi Don lunch special was tiny, and lobster sashimi was kind of too moist .. overall an average lunch experience If you are looking for the massive Sushi boat ... this has a good one.</li><li>I love everything in their gourmet menu, especially the lobster sashimi &amp; foie gras.</li><li>It 's like a food court ... SELF-SERVE! ( FAIL) Once the lobster sashimi came to our table, we were not fully finished with the plate ... they wanted to pick it up ?!???!</li><li>During the whole night, there was no initiative to pick up dirty plates because it was lobster sashimi, they wanted to pick it up ???</li><li>Looking at the rest of the menu, there are some items that seemed interesting, such as lobster sashimi, which very few places sell and are generally very expensive.</li><li>We usually get one of those gold or diamond sets which comes with a whole lot of Sushi, Sashimi and Tempura, but the best is you can add-on the delicious Lobster Sashimi!</li><li>First off here are some items I have tried and liked: LIVE Lobster Sashimi- fresh and delicious, not many restaurants carry this Giant Lobster Teppanyaki Chilled Egg Custard with Seafood Chicken Karaga Uni Seafood Fried Rice- unique, great to have uni and seafood fried rice!</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
