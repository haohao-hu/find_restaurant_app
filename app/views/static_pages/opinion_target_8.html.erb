<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 8' %><h2>dish<br />occurrence: 638</h2><div><ol><li>It was the wrong dish.</li><li>Sure, I get how salt can really embellish the flavour of a dish but I find that most places use it more as a crutch.</li><li>2) Steamed shrimp and vegetable dumplings- This was the one tasty dish we ordered.</li><li>It was not great but awful.- clear skin chive and shrimp dimpling: okay. no complaint here.- black bean spare ribs: extremely salty but very tasty- deep fried squid tentacles: it did n't taste all the fresh because the whole thing was just not al dente enough. it should be less chewy and more rubbery. flavour was okay- garlic baby bok choy: a `` Special'' dish that was over $ 5 with fairly small portion. it was done VERY well though. best dish probably- custard bun: way too much flour and the custard was not dense at all.- singapore vermicelli: good, no complaints Overall, the food was decent, not the greatest dimsum but it satiates the craving, any time of the day.</li><li>It was not great but awful.- clear skin chive and shrimp dimpling: okay. no complaint here.- black bean spare ribs: extremely salty but very tasty- deep fried

n't try that dish.</li><li>This lemon chicken was crispy chicken plain with a side dish filled with the sauce and you determine how much you want to use.</li><li>This is the only place I been to that offer so that offer so much fresh veggie in both their banchan and the main dish.</li><li>When I went with friends we got lots and lots of food, and the manager even gave us an extra complimentary dish.</li><li>One special thing about this place is that they serve you mini dumplings as a side dish ( non-refillable).</li><li>The 3-cup chicken was more like kung pao chicken .... we walked out leaving more than half of each dish and not even bothered with a take-out box.</li><li>Other dish was a beef hot pot, bland and burnt.</li><li>`` This is my dish, we have to try this ...</li><li>Then they 'd start talking about cooking, and how they 'd do their version of the same dish.</li><li>`` You know, Wolfberries would be perfect for this dish!''.</li><li>There was a dish where the base was a massive load of sweet, smooth egg white, topped with eye popping green veggie stuff.</li><li>I got Combo #1: 1 dish, 1 rice and a drink.</li><li>The dish was great.</li><li>Some of your dishes are really good, it would really suck if a person 's experience gets overshadowed with one dish that 's pretty hard to mess up.</li><li>My dish was amazing also.</li><li>Sauces were very thin, the spicy dish had no flavour, much less heat, and the lo mein was some type of ramen noodle with, again, zero flavour.</li><li>I did n't try the other dish but my siblings and mother said it was n't very good.</li><li>The menu was ridiculously expensive- $ 15.50 for the roll we ordered ( sorry, forgot the name, but it sucked!)- we had to pay $ 1 extra for spicy mayo, which they gave quite a bit in a small dish.</li><li>We were given fair warning that it would be forty minutes .. but seriously, what if the entire establishment ordered that dish ?</li><li>Each main course includes a salad and pita bread. as well as a side dish.</li><li>I could have had the same dish at the more elegant Zaffron ( http://www.yelp.ca/biz/zaffron-restaurant-north-york) for practically the same price. nice atmosphere. decent food. good service.</li><li>Considering most places raise their prices every 8-12 months, I 'm impressed! 3) My biggest complaint with most Chinese food places is that you have to order each dish separately, so if a group of people want fried rice, noodles, and a few different meats, they 'd have to order about $ 40 worth of dishes and then divide it up themselves.</li><li>I ordered the $ 5 Combo and got Spicy Chicken ( namesake 's dish), Chicken in Black Bean Sauce, and Deep Fried Pork Chop.</li><li>Apps- Green Salad, pickled bitter melon- they use the Japanese sesame dressing and the salad is not drenched in water therefore it was good, and surprisingly i do n't like bitter melon but this was the only dish I ate most that night its good if you can bear the taste of bitter melon.</li><li>They used instant noodles ( which is fine, just advertise it as such) and the egg that accompanied the dish was fried rather than boiled ...</li><li>Each dish was very tasty and the ingredients were fresh.</li><li>Outside of that, my favourite dish is Hwe Dup Bap which is a bowl of rice and veggies with an assortment of raw fish on top and a special spicy sauce ( made from scratch, I bet you because it 's different and way better than the same sauce elsewhere).</li><li>I 'm supposed my description does n't sound very romantic and does n't do justice to the dish.</li><li>It came with a miso soup, salad, and this noodle-like dish with soup ( I originally thought that was the miso soup).</li><li>I will definitely return, but would try a different dish, and likely pass on the overly filling appetizer.</li><li>For the main course, I had Villetto alla Marsala ( veal scaloppine in a sweet marsala wine sauce) and this dish pushed a mute button on my chatty mouth for a full minute ( kinda made me nervous) as I chewed on the delectable juicy meat with this really mouthwatering sauce.</li><li>Their portion was so big, and I saw many people could n't finish their dish.</li><li>The waiter apologized profusely for it and my roommate was n't too upset about it as the majority of the dish was edible and very tasty!</li><li>The lamb pasta was so badly done, the dish was almost like a microwaved dinner; the meat was chewy, the pasta was disproportionately cold and hot, and the residual oil was overwhelming to my palette.</li><li>Seafood dishes are usually paired with zestier additions which this dish lacked, resulting in an unremarkable plate of loosely placed ingredients.</li><li>I am definitely come back again for this dish!</li><li>I had the wondrous pleasure to try out my friend 's dish, Cannelloni Formaggio $ 17 ( also baked in the pizza oven!) and that was really good!</li><li>An incredibly underwhelming dish.</li><li>So he liked his dish, which was n't too bad.</li><li>Every dish is good and comes with impressive portion and low prices.</li><li>House Fried Rice: This was the only real edible dish ( besides the appetizer) that we could stomach.</li><li>However, although the dish does n't look very big, it was actually very filling, but nonetheless I was not pleased by the poor presentation of the dish.</li><li>However, although the dish does n't look very big, it was actually very filling, but nonetheless I was not pleased by the poor presentation of the dish.</li><li>Its signature dish is their samgyetang ( Ginseng Chicken soup).</li><li>Once all mixed together the dish was a vibrant red, just what I want to see when I 'm craving Korean food.</li><li>The dish was big enough to serve two, as there was quite a bit of chicken.</li><li>I totally recommend this place just for this dish.</li><li>It came out a lot faster than i thought it would! i read in other comments of wishing for a bigger menu, but if they are specializing, the argument is better quality control on what they make. there were six side dishes served with the bubbling hot soup. the chicken had glutinous rice, one piece of fresh ginseng that was full of flavour if you eat it, and one red date. caution: the date has its seed, you could hurt yourself if you bite down too fast too hard on that date. there was also one chestnut ( peeled of course) as well inside the glutinous rice. the waitress left a container lined with a plastic bag -- where chicken bones, red date seed, etc can be discarded. she also added a small dish with noodles to add into the boiling broth. chicken was slide off the bone and the glutinous rice was perfect. the chestnut seemed a little underdone, but i really enjoyed the soup, some may find it a little bland -- there is salt ( might even be sea salt) and black pepper to their soup. i liked it as it was and finished it to the last drop. side dishes: cubes of daikon kimchi, salad of lettuce woth red cabbage with this black sesame dressing, sweet soy fried xubes of potato, sweet pickled julienned slivers of daikon and carrot, marinaded fish cake with green pepper and a cucumber/zucchini marinaded with gochujang and sesame seeds etc. definitely full with a warm belly from this meal. planning this winter to come again and try other things on the menu. especially other ginseng soup options!</li><li>A lady beside us ordered a dish and she was not satisfied with it and they simply apologized and gave her a new dish with no arguments or weird looks or anything.</li><li>The veal was served in a spicy sauce that had a big kick; they did serve hot sauce on the side which I added prior to tasting the dish and realized that it was unnecessary as the dish on its own would probably have been sufficiently spicy.</li><li>The dish as a whole seem to lack a bit of salt and the flavour profile is subtle.</li><li>And while I have n't yet had the Ginseng Chicken, it 's the go-to dish for my friend who swears it 's amazing.</li><li>Love it when they give you just a dish of the kimchi radishes!</li><li>My food came out a delicious dish with a hot, steaming, a small chicken stuffed with rice, ginseng, garlic, and jujube.</li><li>Its a simple dish that I have had so many times but its just done so right in this place.</li><li>When she brought out all the side dishes she described what each dish was.</li><li>The brown rice was included in the dish, which was nice.</li><li>I have been to quite many different restaurant all around yonge area or uptown but I like this one the best. their small dish is soooo good, the main course is soooo good.</li><li>The best part is that the ingredients for each dish are visually represented on the wall, so you definitely know every aspect of the dish.</li><li>The best part is that the ingredients for each dish are visually represented on the wall, so you definitely know every aspect of the dish.</li><li>Maybe we also made the mistake of not ordering their signature dish, chicken ginseng.</li><li>I 've never experienced this, but although the stone pot for my bibimbap was hot, the rice did my even stick to the pot to create that slight crust of rice this dish is known for.</li><li>The best dish was probably the chicken, nice crispy outside and tender inside.</li><li>INCREDIBLE dish!</li><li>Sichuan Boiled Fish and Cold Spicy Beef). maybe that 's our ordering, but every dish was too fried, too greasy and too battered. we could not finish what we ordered and ended up with 3 boxes of leftovers. as a chinese person, i cannot recommend this restaurant ... instead, go 15 mins away for a much more authentic and flavourful szechuan experience @ http://www.yelp.ca/biz/hot-spicy-spicy-north-york Best Hakkah food and they deliver so fast !!</li><li>Here is my experiance: Chilli chicken with gravy: If I would of known that the gravy is mostly of oil, I would of avoided this dish.</li><li>The dish is overcooked--well more like burned.</li><li>Devan R made the dish picks for our UYE group and did n't let us down.</li><li>Also, I 'd order a vegetable dish or two next time.</li><li>But the food is absolutely wonderful. we are regular customer, s at this restaurant, Tonight we ordered the usual, our favourte dish is peanut chicken, we brought our three dish, s home and upon opening the chicken we saw half the dish was peanut sauce and less than half the usual amount of chicken, I called the restaurant and spoke to the owner for ten minutes, she insisted that it was made the same as always, It was not at all, we paid 11,95 for peanut sauce and a small amount of chicken,, The arrogant owner could not care less, refusing to credit us for next time we picked up, or d delivering a new dish to our home, This place the staff is unfriendly, not well mannered, and horrible customer service, and the food was awful, except for the fried rice, it was good, If your looking for bad service this is the place to go, the customer is never right,, be warned, When Szechuan was still something Torontonians lined up for, Henry 's Hunan Place was the place to beat.</li><li>But the food is absolutely wonderful.

it 's hard to find places that does this right.</li><li>The flavor combination was so strange that none of our friends liked this dish.</li><li>Got rude stares from two of the waiters for ordering only one dish ....</li><li>Definitely a 5 star for the dish!</li><li>Once the dish was cooked, it turned into a spicy octopus stew.</li><li>This dish is officially my favorite Korean dish now.:) Service was prompted and the restaurant was clean and cozy.</li><li>Food is fresh and you can tell the care that goes into each dish.</li><li>I think every dish is under $ 20, with pupusas ranging from $ 2.50- $ 3 and they each come with a salad called curtido and tomato sauce.</li><li>I had the Thai Spicy Noodle and the dish was a little greasy especially the eggplant and was not spicy enough for me or my co-worker who ordered the same dish.</li><li>I had the Thai Spicy Noodle and the dish was a little greasy especially the eggplant and was not spicy enough for me or my co-worker who ordered the same dish.</li><li>I had to take home my main dish which is by far my staple item every time I go to Spring Rolls- Mango Chicken.</li><li>I 'd only had half of the dish and shortly after I HAD ONE OF THE WORST FOOD POISONING IN MY LIFE.</li><li>I was pleased with how it enhanced the overall dish.</li><li>All but the two Chop Suey dishes arrived in aluminium containers large enough that the entire 6 dish order allowed the two of us to not have to cook for 3 nights.</li><li>I was an instant fan of this dish.</li><li>Anybody that eats Pho understands that the star of the dish is the broth.</li><li>The dish consisted of a bowl of skin on, bone in chicken thighs with potatoes in a curry sauce and a plate of rice.</li><li>Although this dish was quite delicious, I doubt I would order it again.</li><li>The place is really really pricy, one would often find themselves paying over $ 6 per dish, so if you wanna splurge, get the fish.</li><li>It 's Authentic Szechuan and EVERY dish I 've ever ordered is delicious .....</li><li>Saw a guest ordered a dish in the hidden menu, called beef in sour soup.</li><li>I noticed the Lunch Rice Specials ( $ 6.99) offered a large dish and a mountain of Steamed Rice.</li><li>But rather than picking your own food to be cooked, they have a dish called exactly that but without any explanations of what is in the dish.</li><li>He had no interest in telling us what is inside the dish.</li><li>We did n't order the dish.</li><li>We decided that we wanted to order this hot and spicy dish that we recognize the name of, which is a hot and spicy broth with pig 's blood and intestines and my mom asked me what else i wanted, and I said i wanted something with vermicelli in it. we flagged down another waitress, made our orders, and asked for a dish that had vermicelli in it.</li><li>Our third dish was a spicy vegetable that had no salt, so we asked them to add salt.</li><li>This was the best dish!</li><li>This dish is flavourful, fresh and spicy.</li><li>Im giving this place 5 star for my love of fish in chili oil soupy dish.</li><li>They always do my fave dish excellent.</li><li>If we just had this one dish, I 'd give this place 4/5.</li><li>However I felt the dish was only flavorful at the top where all the toppings were.</li><li>Overall the dish is great on a hot day but service is not good here.</li><li>I understand that this is a pub and not a French bistro, but come on ... let 's at least get the fundamentals of the dish right.</li><li>Very limited parking in this dingy plaza ... upon entering this place we were not greeted by anyone at all, the cashier did n't even bother saying a single word, Infact the entire time at this place the only word that was spoken to us by the cashier and waitress combined is $ 15.50 ..... there goes their tip and customer service, we decided to just seat ourselves where a table had menus on it, the waitress did n't give us tea and ordering slip til 10mins later .... typically pho place that 's very cheap like $ 7 a dish depending on what you order The whole entire time I did n't hear a single word from the waitress and she looked so pissed off, did n't break a smile but oh well Mediocre food, nothing special and honestly I 've tasted better bun and com dishes elsewhere Here 's my most favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Toronto ... everything is sooooo good, I used to have dinner there almost twice a week while I was living in that area.</li><li>The dish usually comes with bean sprouts but I asked for none.</li><li>The dish was n't bad, but there was so much potential for more.</li><li>I practically dump the entire bowl on the my dish.</li><li>The fruit is a nice side to tone down the richness of the dish.</li><li>It 's a smart move, but older diners pull out reading glasses and struggle to angle the card, so the plastic does n't catch light and obscure the dish descriptions.</li><li>Overall a decent dish.</li><li>Great great restaurant ... have been going here for years ... under a different owner ... never the less I continued to get the same amazing service ... staff us very attentive ... must try everyone is the portobello mushroom salad ... for our main entree we always ended making our dish picking from different entrees ... wat I do miss is a grilled jumbo tiger shrimp the previous owner used to make me .... he said it was my special thing .... and mayb an addition of a triple chocolate cake/cheese cake .... it wud make a difference in the desert ... it did enjoyed today 's tirimisu.</li><li>Ordered the Olympia pasta and was able to easily switch to a rose sauce instead, thoroughly enjoyed this dish.</li><li>They acknowledged that it tasted awful but did not agree to my request to replace it although i had only one bite! asked me to dump the dish in the garbage and try next time. no money was refunded in the absence of the `` manager''.</li><li>One of my favorite sides is the potatoes and the hummus. really a hole in the wall! love their potato and rice besides the main dish.</li><li>My only one unpleasant experience is when a lady served us the shawarma plate and she forgot to top the rice with some onions and garlic sauce, ( place was not busy, only one person dining in and one takeout customer) so I had to walk back from the car in the rain to kindly request for the toppings that add a gazillion notch to this dish, which she gladly did.</li><li>Nevertheless, they offered another dish but i declined and appreciated the offer at least.</li><li>So I was thoroughly disappointed with my dish.</li><li>The food came with gravy spilt all over my items ... one dish seaping into the other.</li><li>I have n't ventured into their curries as of yet, with the exception of the Nihari- which really is a hit or miss dish- and i 've found with them as well, it 's a hit or miss- sometimes being excellent and sometimes being decent.</li><li>Every dish we order tastes the same every time and that is a crucial feature for any food joint.</li><li>This $ 8.99 dish is a big portion and can last 1-4 meals depending on how you hungry you are or how much you ration it.</li><li>The spicy mustard that went with the rye bread and the beef made the dish all the more salivating and I took home a pound of the corned beef following my meal ...... three homemade sandwiches later with Wolfie 's meat, I 'd still go back for more I quite liked the friendly man who served us the two times we went.</li><li>Not a very special dish.</li><li>It 's a combination of sushi, tempura and korean dish.</li><li>They gave us a `` complimentary'' dish which was Grilled Mackarel and it was so good.</li><li>Braised Lamb Shank ( $ 19)- great value as the dish is good portion with a lot of sides of fresh vegetables!</li><li>My mom and I had the same dish ( penne arrabbiata) while my cousins had ravioli and capellini.</li><li>The other dish was Gen. Tso chicken this had very little chicken most of it was just breaded and covered in sauce.</li><li>The Steamed Chicken wrapped in lotus leaf was a bit disappointing as it was the one dish we were looking forward to the most.</li><li>There was the interesting perfume that comes with steaming something in lotus leaf, but did n't really save the dish.</li><li>We debated on whether or not to order the Calamari Fritti ( Fried Calamari), and the waitress surprised us with the dish anyways!</li><li>The other main dish ordered was the Grilled Veal Chop.</li><li>To say the least, it was an impressive dish!</li><li>Pasta- Dairy intolerance in the group, the whole dish tasted like butter.</li><li>Any how the dish is like having chicken thrown into a deep fryer and away it goes.</li><li>It was n't too oily but the thing left an after taste that was typical of the dish.</li><li>Better if you get a dish when it first comes out.</li><li>The service is always very fast and accommodating as I usually ask for extra limes or a small dish of nuoc cham even when it does n't come with the dish.</li><li>Vermicelli dish was also ok.</li><li>I 've been to places where you are given a sliver of lime to add to your dish and I ca n't believe that such actions can be justified in terms of savings.</li><li>Ordered: Vermicelli with grilled pork and pork sausage- A personal fave dish I like to order at Vietnamese restaurants.</li><li>If it 's your first time ordering this dish, it could be a little confusing.</li><li>I have n't tried the other dishes they offer but I highly recommend this dish!</li><li>I thought it lacked flavour, but it was the dish that kept giving as 3 dishes came ou of this one pot.</li><li>This dish is great for sharing with friends and is perfect for nourishment during the hot Toronto summers.</li><li>There is 6 side dishes ( it 's delicious) but no refills ( 75 cents per dish refill) They seat 2 people at the 6 person tables, which I think is a bit ridiculously, they should rearrange the seats around so they can maximize the amount of people that can be seated at this restaurant, so there is n't always people waiting.</li><li>I ordered pork bone soup ( quite the standard dish).</li><li>Great dish to have in cold Toronto winter.</li><li>I just hope they do not add so much salt and oil to the dish in the future.</li><li>Sushi was well-rolled, not falling apart, sloppy, or just plopped on the dish.</li><li>In all honesty I do n't even remember what my dish was called, it was beef with noodles in hot sauce, with ice.</li><li>Most famous is the lechon- get any dish with that and you 'll enjoy it.</li><li>It is served with a side of this dried fish sauce which really adds another dimension to the dish!</li><li>Without it, it literally tastes like what it is- ox tail in peanut sauce, which is n't bad, but the fish sauce changes the whole dish.</li><li>Even though the dish was found under the soup category, it is saucy enough to have with rice.</li><li>It tasted similar to Chinese Shanghai noodles except with lemon juice, which also, like the fish sauce in the previous dish, really adds another dimension to the dish.</li><li>The beef in my dish was tender, garnished with a lot of onions and some brocoli and a large serving of rice.</li><li>The Kare Kare is the must order dish, such a rich, unique flavour.</li><li>It 's not really spicy, but they toss it in a mild chili sauce- Garlic Fried Rice ( ca n't go wrong with this dish.</li><li>The garlic is not too overpowering, and it was a nice side dish to all of the main dishes)- Pancit Sampaguita ( great noodle dish because it had a lot of the meats, seafood and veggies- it was nice and moist [ not dry ])- Crispy Chicken with house sauce ( boneless chicken used with batter, not what I expected but still a good dish to order.</li><li>The garlic is not too overpowering, and it was a nice side dish to all of the main dishes)- Pancit Sampaguita ( great noodle dish because it had a lot of the meats, seafood and veggies- it was nice and moist [ not dry ])- Crispy Chicken with house sauce ( boneless chicken used with batter, not what I expected but still a good dish to order.</li><li>It 's not oily, it 's quite light and comes with a nice sweet and sour sauce on the side)- Steamed ( Turbot) Fish ( this was a great dish!</li><li>It was n't fishy at all)- Kare Kare ( it was n't my favorite dish on the menu.</li><li>Still an ok dish though) Lots of other great dishes served to other tables.</li><li>Maybe next time, I 'll try a different dish.</li><li>The barbequed meat was dark, nicely flavored, and the dish was n't excessively filled with noodles either.</li><li>The dish had generous amounts of basil and mint which I really love about Vietnamese food.</li><li>I told him I was looking for a beef or chicken dish.</li><li>+ 1 star for this dish.</li><li>( Go to Thumbs Up or House of Soon Tofu for this dish made properly, plus cheaper).</li><li>However, be warned, the last time I was there, I ordered this dish and the pork was not tender ( very dry).</li><li>Chicken and Salty Fish Fried Rice ( $ 6.99) I 'm going to sound like a broken record here but THIS DISH IS DELICIOUS !!!!</li><li>My buddy got the veal parmigiana sandwich and it actually looked better then the food on my dish.</li><li>My dish also came with some delicious garlic bread.</li><li>I would order this again and again and, if you do as I did, and share the veal chop and risotto between yourself your companion, you really have a perfect winter dish.</li><li>The rest of the food was pretty good- but I feel like the stand out dish was their pasta of the day.</li><li>Since the dish I was going to try would have required each of those toppings, I decided to just turn around and leave.</li><li>The friend that got the fajitas complained he only had 3 tortillas with his dish but they gave him a good serving of rice on the side to make up for that.</li><li>I found myself thirsty all the time, could possibly be due to the amount of salt they put into the dish.</li><li>The enchiladas was basic, not too pleased that the cheese was n't melted on top as that is what makes the dish.</li><li>Some of the beef was more chewy than the rest but overall the dish was good.</li><li>A dish we did not order was accidentally brought to us.</li><li>- Sweet and Sour ( Xiamen/Amoy) vermicelli A Chinese staple, this dish is one of the many variations to making vermicelli epic.</li><li>We had ordered sauteed garlic shoots but they brought us the wrong dish and we sent it back.</li><li>Also ordered a sizzling shrimp with ginger and green onion which was the best dish of all.</li><li>Eggplant &amp; Minced Pork Spicy Sauce in Hot Pot ( $ 8.75) was overly sweet with no spiciness or the `` fish fragrance'' Garlic Shoots with Garlic ( $ 8.75) was a little oily but was the best dish of the evening.</li><li>Portions were huge and priced fairly at about $ 7- $ 10 per dish.</li><li>3) A new Chinese vegetable dish I never had before, kind of looked like green beans but harder like broccoli- so good and my new fav. chinese veggie dish.</li><li>3) A new Chinese vegetable dish I never had before, kind of looked like green beans but harder like broccoli- so good and my new fav. chinese veggie dish.</li><li>4) Beef short-ribs with pepper &amp; Garlic served on a hot plate- this was the only poor dish tonight, the meat was very tough and lacking significant flavour.</li><li>The dish was great though.</li><li>I had their buffalo chicken poutine and it was really good, I never had poutine like this before and as a big fanatic of one, I did enjoy this dish!</li><li>This dish was pretty good, however, tasted too oily the more I eat it.</li><li>Restaurant: Joons Cuisine: Korean Location: North York Address: 4852 Yonge St Price Range: $ 10 ~ 15 1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent Food: 4 Service: 3 Ambiance: 3 Overall: 3.5 Extra information:* Many items for 2 people minimum* 2 locations ( North York &amp; Christie)* Vegetarian option Avail I love table-top cooked dishes, they are the best because you share same thing with everyone ... which means no crying over who ordered a better dish.</li><li>If I say it 's not spicy ... it 's really not spicy* I did n't like the mozarella cheese, it had weird texture and it took away the spiciness of the dish* Instant noodles were good after it soaked up all the sauce* When you are 80% done, ask for your rice to be cooked and they will do it for you* I love the crispy bottom part of the rice Summary: I would go back to Joons, but would order things differently.</li><li>Mario Batali would probably cringe at the sight of this dish but quite frankly, who cares .. as long as it tastes good and that it did.</li><li>Surprisingly, the spaghetti was done to a perfect al dente and the whole dish was remarkably tasty. ( like your very own perfected college cuisine done right!)</li><li>I ordered one dish and had studied the menu diligently.</li><li>Asia station makes the dish as a casserole.</li><li>This time I also tried the Kalbi beef and it was yummy! added a star because I remembered that they gave me a complimentary dish for being a good customer.</li><li>There is plenty of sashimi in these chirashi dishes and also a lot of rice which I think they throw in the make the dish look bigger and to fill you up.</li><li>When asked if they have saucy pad thai, he explained that the authentic dish is not meant to be saucy and should have a sweet tangy flavour.</li><li>Maybe that 's why they have the $ 10 minimum, because they know customers would n't be full with just one dish.</li><li>This dish is honestly the best curry dish I 've had anywhere, ever, and I get it all the time.</li><li>Thought it was cute how he drawled out names of every dish he placed in front of us.</li><li>It was very tasty although there was hardly any chicken in the dish and the portion was small ( apparently 1/3 less than what my coworker would have normally received) and I still felt hungry after finishing.</li><li>Mains: Basil Noodles with Seafood ... Very tasty, colourful dish, packed with flavours!</li><li>This restaurant has the dish perfectly cooked.</li><li>My sinuses definitely cleared up upon consuming this dish.</li><li>As expected the dish smelled very fishy although my parents suggest it was not fishy enough.</li><li>It 's a very spicy dish and very favourful.</li><li>This restaurant serves a variety of Vietnamese dishes including pho and rice and pork chops but their signature dish is Bun Bo Hue which is a spicy beef noodle soup.</li><li>Bun bo hue, or literal translation, beef vermicelli noodles Hue style in soup is a dish originating from the central highlands of Hue in Vietnam.</li><li>In the winter months it can quite chilly so hence, the need for this dish.</li><li>It is definitely their best dish and the staff will tell you that themselves.</li><li>Will come back for this dish !!</li><li>I had the chance to try it and while I liked it more than my dish, I thought its seafood components overpowered the dish- I know it 's a seafood pasta, and there 's a lot of ingredients from the sea in it to prove it, but they did n't blend too well with the marinara sauce and with each other.</li><li>When I make pesto at home, I usually blend the pine nuts into the sauce, but these were mixed in whole, so you could only taste them when you bit into one but there were n't enough in the dish to have one in every bite.</li><li>My pasta was well cooked, but the chicken tasted like something you would find in a McDonald 's salad and the mushrooms were good, but that was the basis of the dish.</li><li>The dish itself was still OK, but I could n't fully enjoy it.</li><li>- My family and I are big eaters so we ordered a dish each.</li><li>The seafood linguini is probably the worst I 've ever had, and I love that dish.</li><li>I 've eaten at Chowon about 10 times now, but in all but one visit, have only ever ordered the same dish.</li><li>This place makes an amazing kamponggi and the $ 13 dish can easily feed 2 or 3 people.</li><li>I just went there again on Saturday at 1pm for lunch and we decided to order a second dish since there were 4 of us there this time and settled on a seafood casserole ( haemul jeongol for $ 20).</li><li>I do appreciate fresh fish and certainly do n't even normally mind eating Chinese steamed whole fish with bones and all, but the fish bones in this dish was too much.</li><li>I would rather the dish be cut in half along with the price and that way people, especially smaller group or a couple can leave room to try other things.</li><li>Otherwise, the price and dish sizes are not exactly made for dinner for 2, or allow room to share and try much more dishes.</li><li>If you like beer they have beer + dish combo 's which are very cheap ( off the top of my head i think it 's ~ $ 25 for a large plate of kanpunggi and 5 domestic beers).</li><li>Spicy Seafood Hot Pot ( $ 14.99)- If you are into fish, you would love this dish- If you are hungry, you would be stuffed- If you are into noodles, you will be in heaven- I wish this is more spicy- This definitely not that live seafood hot pot I had before with all those seafood tossed in alive .. but good enough at this price!</li><li>I did n't use any of it because the dish was covered in red spicy sauce.</li><li>The tiny shrimp was disappointing as it was very small pieces of cut up mini shrimp so it became obsolete to the dish.</li><li>That way you can taste everything and not get stuck eating one single dish.</li><li>The dish itself was rather small, but the quality and sheer size of the scallops were great.</li><li>It ` a $ 40 gigantic dish to share which had generous portions of mussels, squid, clams, shrimps ... and KING CRAB!</li><li>The staff were amazing and so helpful. we went yesterday for dinner and ordered INSALATA CAPRESE and CALAMARI FRITTI and were so good. and for the main course we ordered ORECCHIETTE AROMANTICA and a special dish ( chicken breast stuffed with cheese and spinach and vegetables on the side) and that when it went totally wrong.</li><li>The food was horrible, the chicken was under cooked, too sour, it was not stuffed with anything and it came with bones! spinach was below the chicken and the cheese was melted on top of the chicken chew skin: (, half a spoon of mashed potato that did not taste good and couple of carrots scattered around the dish.</li><li>They do not mentioned about the price of those dish.</li><li>Everything mixed together was ok, I 've had better pasta dishes so I was not especially impressed with the dish.</li><li>Nothing major just things like getting the wrong dish, or forgetting to include something.</li><li>You are also able to personalize how many chilli peppers you would like for each dish.</li><li>This dish was my favourite among the three, although a little on the salty side.</li><li>The manager was a lot nicer and offered to exchange it for a better dish, the curry chicken.</li><li>The chicken was tender and the pieces were decently sized but this dish was nothing special.</li><li>The curries in my opinion could be spicier, that dish was n't too satisfying.</li><li>Ordered the off menu lobster curry special, which was an excellent and tasty dish.</li><li>Pannang Curry- I liked this dish best. very tasty! the beef was cooked well and very very tender.</li><li>Green Curry- nice dish but not that particularly tasty. i had asked the waitress for hot sauce but never got it.</li><li>The dish comes presented so that you can see the duck portion you ordered ..</li><li>This was an okay dish ..</li><li>Still a good dish, just not as good in light of the other dishes.</li><li>The waitress brought the dish back to kitchen and deep fried again, which came out with no blood but outside was too overcooked to bite into.</li><li>Golden chicken curry- the portion of this dish was huge, but I was n't expecting a piece of chicken breast cut up and laid out on top of the curry.</li><li>The dish was n't bad.</li><li>The curry itself was missing an authentic thai quality ( i cant explain it), but I would say, it definitely felt like a fusion dish to me.</li><li>Another dish is King Oyster with Tofu.</li><li>The most is to give 2 ends of the same roll of tofu in a dish to a customer.</li><li>When we brought the fact that the vegetable dish had very little variety of vegetables, our server responded by looking blankly at us and saying, `` so would anyone like to order desert ?</li><li>Good decor though, you can enjoy that while your waiting for your second dish to be brought out because you returned the first for it 's gross taste So I came here in early fall and both my mom and I feel that this place has gone downhill so fast.</li><li>Instead of tasting like coconut, it tasted more of the seafood stock it was based on and was kind of off putting when you were expecting coconut milk because it was in the title of the dish.</li><li>I would highly recommend this dish.</li><li>Best dish is the panang curry- Beef panang ( lunch and dinner portions are prepared differently- dinner is crispy), or my favourite, the Thai Islamic Noodles with shrimp and chicken.</li><li>I really liked the presentation of the dish because the pad thai itself is inside an egg wrap.</li><li>The duck red curry serviced with rice ( $ 21) is such an incredible dish.</li><li>For the spice lovers, the spiciness level of almost every dish can be adjusted to meet your tolerance.</li><li>These were a great first dish, the sauce really helped bring out the flavour of the mango and carrots inside.</li><li>Some appetizers were very delicious but very pricey and each dish was n't enough to share with 3 others.</li><li>The crispy beef in panang curry was a great dish.</li><li>The flavour of the duck was rich and fragrant, but it overpowered the entire dish and the plate seemed a bit over priced.</li><li>Nice at helping me navigate away from shrimp dishes and for making a dish without shrimp so I could eat it ( allergy).</li><li>Entreé 1) Thai glutinous rice wrapped in crispy duck- awesome dish.</li><li>We order Beef Panang Curry but they gave us something else that had a curry but deep fried beef- which is apparently their signature dish.</li><li>Like others have stated, it would 've been nice if there was extra sauce but this dish in itself is a solid 4.5 stars for me.</li><li>If you do come here, I suggest the Golden Curry and the Beef Panang which was initially proposed by our waitress ( Beef Panang FTW! it was soooo good we ended getting 2 orders of it so I highly recommend this dish).</li><li>I guess it is hit or miss. You 're looking at $ 10/pound for each dish.</li><li>I know Burek as Borek, which is a common dish in Turkey.</li><li>I took the Chicken Soup with the MATZO BALL option ( $ 4.10) and it was filled up to the top so much it overflowed to the serving dish underneath.</li><li>The place was still renovating, did n't have a lot items on their menu and I got the wrong dish.</li><li>The food is not bad but I am giving it one star for obnoxious service because the server and owner hassled one of our party about sending back a dish.</li><li>They also have gloves for this messy dish which is neat.</li><li>The lady sitting next to us complained about her dish being too spicy, where she was met by the waitress with an unexpected heartfelt response of: `` Um, I 'm SORRY ...''</li><li>( $ 13) The lamb soup comes loaded with lamb meat, so make sure you scoop from the bottom! ( $ 9) The lamb leg is the only dish I 'd pass on again.</li><li>The lunch special soup noodles and wontons are a great dish!</li><li>The first dish that arrived was the cold dish.</li><li>The lamb with Chinese yam is a good dish.</li><li>The beef was tender with sweet and garlic flavours which gave the dish a nice balance.</li><li>Every table had ordered this dish.</li><li>So here is the verdict on each dish.</li><li>Fried Lamb Tongue a more exotic dish for some I guess though we we stayed away from the Vday special.</li><li>The dry spice also elevated this dish.</li><li>The Sesame Lamb Chops were good, but can be very gamey ( some like that), so if you are n't a big fan of lamb, this dish might turn you off of it for a bit.</li><li>When we ordered a cold dish he reminded us several times that its cold and not warm.</li><li>I was shocked how cook there made this dish and they were literally deep frying the chopped eggplant.</li><li>The dish was 7.99.</li><li>I have somewhat began making the dish at home myself because a basa fish fillet ( 2 fillets actually) come up to about cheaper ( about half the price) than the meal itself.</li><li>The hummus was pretty good, it was quite creamy and went well with their house made hot sauce; however I felt like a little more garlic would have elevated this dish.</li><li>I wake up on Saturday mornings and crave the Bacon Veggie Melt It 's a Benedict style dish with green peppers, onions, mushrooms, spinach, and bacon atop a perfect poached egg and an english muffin covered in hollandaise &amp; cheese.</li><li>I feel like in this day and age restaurants should have proper receipts clearly indicating what you ordered and how much you are getting charged for each dish.</li><li>The dish was again quite oily but the flavour was quite good.</li><li>Lobster: The most common dish ordered here is, obviously, a whole lobster.</li><li>Once again they use the curry so that it makes you appreciate how the flavour works with the meat and Roti and not just feel that it is the only thing in the dish.</li><li>We ordered two regular sized congee ( the oyster and the pumpkin/lobster), a chow mein, a vegetable dish, fried fish pieces, and Shumai.</li><li>Each side dish is rather large so two people will have more than enough to eat with two side dishes.</li><li>The `` crab'' in it did n't really taste like crab, plus it was battered and deep fried and it just made the dish feel too heavy.</li><li>Basically, that was the theme -- I enjoyed each dish, nothing bad and nothing really superb.</li><li>We then ordered spicy squid, seafood Cantonese chow mien, shrimp fried rice and a mixed vegetable dish.</li><li>One dish would 've likely been sufficient for the two of us so we had to take a bit home.</li><li>My next favorite dish is the Seafood and mixed vegetable Taiwanese vermicelli.</li><li>The best dish hands down is the fried turnip patties.</li><li>The salt and pepper deep fried squid has a great kick which is perfect for this cold winter day, and tryly a yummy dish.</li><li>The two of us ordered the crispy cantonese chow mein, fried chili turnip patties, spice &amp; pepper salt squid, and the dish behind the house super bowl congee in the picture ( ca n't remember what it was called).</li><li>One star lost only because they had forgotten one dish and they had to make it after all the others had arrived.</li><li>I had the snow shoot vegetables ... usually when you order this dish- they fry it in oil and garlic.</li><li>The dish came out in a white milky translucent broth.</li><li>I 've never seen this dish turn out like this before ( even at this establishment).</li><li>Next was the fried turnip cubes ( usually a favorite of mine at this place) .... the dish was very substandard compared to what it used to be in the past.</li><li>45 mins into the meal, I still had n't received this dish.</li><li>This was a 5 star dish.</li><li>Creamy Pork Soup with noodle: No care was put into the making of this dish.</li><li>Last time I went for food, they gave me a dish that was rice soup + chicken + vegetables.</li><li>Sometimes you get Pork neck bone soup with 4 side dish and purple rice for $ 4.95 + tax.</li><li>In fact the description was `` beef something or other'' and I could not tell if there was any beef in the dish.</li><li>It was great that they have a non-spicy option, otherwise I would n't get to try this dish since you have to order at least two portions.</li><li>Although I think the dish will taste a lot more delicious with some spicy sauce, but without it it still taste awesome!</li><li>We ordered the only thing at Joons that they 're famous for- Dak Gal Bee- and this dish is served in a large pan with the ingredients cooked at the table, so be prepared to wait awhile to eat, which is tortuous for incredibly hungry patrons.</li><li>The Dak Gal Bee came shortly after and despite all the other reviews it was a good portion size for two people, an overall heavy dish.</li><li>A + + for that amazing dish.</li><li>I loved their schmorgashboard of ramen, cheese, chicken, rice sticks and sweet potato in one dish!</li><li>Its a dish that everyone loves.</li><li>The dish is called Spicy Chicken ( Dak Gal Bi), but you barely get any.</li><li>Maybe they should rename the dish ... to Spicy Noodles with Chicken.</li><li>The dish is predominantly Instant Noodles and rice cakes.</li><li>The sauces they made for the dish was really good.</li><li>If you do n't do the add ons, then you do n't really have much of a dish.</li><li>As a side note, they have this mashed potato side dish which is sooo good, oddly sweet but so delicious!</li><li>My coworker had some kind of dish served in a round kettle where everything was separated: rice, meat, vegetables, etc but then you are supposed to mix it all together.</li><li>My other two coworkers had the meal for 2 that is cooked right at your table ( hot plate is IN the table) and their dish was dark meat chicken and vegetables.</li><li>Definitely a dish I 've never tried at any other Korean restaurants and definitely worth a try.</li><li>Bibimbap tip: if you are not sure how spicy you like this dish, scoop out some of the hot sauce first.</li><li>We had added ramen and cheese ( $ 2 each) and even with those added, the dish was tiny.</li><li>I usually go with one other friend, and we 're able to finish the whole dish feeling very full and satisfied!</li><li>The dakgalbi dishes now require you to place a minimum of 2 orders per dish, which can be quite pricey, considering the popular add ons- rice cakes, noodles and cheese, are an additional ~ $ 2 each.</li><li>Whenever I have a craving for this dish I always go back here.</li><li>They no longer bring the hot burner out but instead bring the dish fully cooked for you.</li><li>The dish is still tasty, but its missing the bit of burnt crispiness when you overcook it slightly.</li><li>If you get rice with the dish, do n't eat everything right away.</li><li>I think this diminishes the appeal of the dish a little bit, but if you 've never had it you should try it.</li><li>Hearty comfort food for me! n the mash potato side dish is so yummy too! towards the end when u only have a bit of chicken n pieces of veggies left in ur pan, you can ask them to make fried rice with it. they will bring over rice, hot sauce/sesame oil mixture n mix it all up for u. the owner lady even formed the rice into a heart shape for me n my boyfriend one time. it was too cute ~! the Dak Gal Bee is so good there, every time we go that 's all we get. so i do n't know how the other items on the menu taste. oh and the minimum order for Dak Gal Bee is 2 people portions. service is fine, waitresses are pleasant, but sometimes do n't speak much English, but who cares, food 's good!</li><li>They tend to cook at one table and bring the pan to you later ... not cool: (- if you 're getting the entrees which they cook in front of you, you have to order 2 of the same dish which generally leads to less choice/variety- they only accept debit or cash I actually did n't realize this until lately, but what they cook in front of you can be easily replicated at home.</li><li>It really amazes me how the same ingredient, used in the same dish could turn out so differently.</li><li>When they execute a dish right, like the eggplant pizza slice, it soars.</li><li>- Tossed Cucumber- Another good dish, fresh cucumbers with a sour and sesame flavoured dressing.</li><li>This is your answer Hand made and pulled noodles with a wide variety of options to serve all tasted Pretty much every bowl is under ten bucks so not a tough decision to make However there is only seating for 14 customers so it 's a bit of a bolt hole but worth the wait to grab a seat Great service and great food My dish had wide flat noodles and had the right amount of chew to them and it 's a huge portion All ingredients were fresh and it felt odd I was the only gaijin in the place where the waitress kept trying to explain to me how to eat ..... no I know chopsticks yeah h-mart yes noodles .... hahaha Excellent and unique food, savory noodles, excellent ambiance.</li><li>2 of us ordered the same dish n it tasted really bad, so we told them we do n't want 1 of them anymore n take it off our bill n the waitress nodded.</li><li>I 'm pretty sure it 's common sense that when food is sent back to the kitchen untouched, it means that the kitchen fucked up on that particular dish n y should we pay for sth we did n't even touch at all. #artisannoodle #老碗 #chinesefood #northyork #badservice #shittyfood Small and cozy place in North York.</li><li>However, this dish made me really appreciate the thick hand pulled ribbon noodles that artisan noodle is so known for.</li><li>It seemed really oily at first but I did n't mind it as it did n't ' taste' oily when I was eating the dish.</li><li>This is also a very good dish for take out, as the pao mo is meant to be soaked in the soup, so the its texture does n't get ruined.</li><li>( I prefer mine hotter) but this is still a very good dish.</li><li>Our main dish ( Biang Biang Mian) was a main dish ...</li><li>The overall flavour of the dish was well-rounded.</li><li>We ordered the following: Pork Jia-Mo Less than a year ago, we traveled to Xi' an where we tried this dish.</li><li>Again, if the dish in Xi' an was a 10/10, this was a 7.5/10.</li><li>Spicy Fish Fillet Noodle Soup I have a sneaking suspicion that as a white girl ordering this dish, they may have toned down the spice.</li><li>He does this for each individual dish.</li><li>Though it 's a relatively cheap dish, so I suppose I ca n't complain too much about it.</li><li>So, never mind that my beef stew noodles was n't really what it should be- even if I had ordered the wrong dish, my dish was n't much to be desired anyways.</li><li>So, never mind that my beef stew noodles was n't really what it should be- even if I had ordered the wrong dish, my dish was n't much to be desired anyways.</li><li>I LOVE this dish.</li><li>The whole dish tasted off and I was extremely disappointed.</li><li>Despite the 3 Chili spicy rating, this dish was packed with the right amount of heat.</li><li>Even the Singapore vermicelli ( which is usually a tasty, reliable dish) was dry and pasty.</li><li>I did try the sticky rice cakes but would not recommend it, in general it 's a tough dish to make I think.</li><li>The prices of each dish is reasonable with generous portions and there is consistent food quality across the chain.</li><li>Cons: I find that each dish in the restaurant is only mediocre.</li><li>After paying, we realized they totally charged us for the dish they took away but never brought back.</li><li>I did n't like the dish that the mini desert came in.</li><li>The piece de resistence was my matzo brie.It 's supposed to be softened matzo mixed with eggs &amp; onions to give it a taste.This dish was cold, tasteless &amp; unappetizing.</li><li>Another recommended dish is the Sizzling Beef, which comes on a hot plate, quite literally still sizzling.</li><li>Quality is uniform from year to year and it is just a very delicious dish.</li><li>Instead, we got a dish of a handful of duck pieces with more bean sprouts.</li><li>We saw the dish placed on the table and it looked like a deflated, leftover plate of noodles.</li><li>Then there were other dishes, Fried rice, was grease and cold, Chinese broccoli was good ( But how can you go wrong with the most simple dish) but COLD!</li><li>Because of the small portion, we ordered another dish- sizzling beef.</li><li>Before it was delivered to portable, i saw a waitress pouring water in the dish and stirring it.</li><li>Ok, i understand that part about the plate being too hot and it sometimes needs some cooling down process; however, I want all cooking done in the kitchen and I want a cook/chef to cook my dish.</li><li>Seasoning, changing the temperature of the dish- that 's the chef 's job and it should not be altered by a waitress.</li><li>I asked for spicy and the flavour went well with the bitter greens, however the dish ended up being a little too oily due to the chilli oil.</li><li>This was my second time getting this dish.</li><li>The side polpette are meatballs served in a small dish of tomato sauce.</li><li>A fajita wrap filled with succulent chicken, spinach, goat cheese, and grilled onions makes for a one-of-a-kind dish.</li><li>The same dish tastes different every time you order it--sometimes delicious, sometimes mediocre, sometimes terrible!</li><li>Particularly the pesto linguini, as that is the dish I always order.</li><li>It was a perfectly balanced dish!</li><li>The flavor profile of this dish was great- a hint of bitterness from the arugula, freshness from the basil pesto and sweetness from the sundried tomatoes.</li><li>It was delightful dish.</li><li>My only concern was the amount of oil in the dish as the pasta was drenching in oil.</li><li>Again, a very composed dish but slightly on the heavier side.</li><li>A light char may have enhanced the flavor and texture to the dish.</li><li>I went with a benchmark dish I like to use as a comparison dish: Caesar salad ( Cesar) @ $ 7.00.</li><li>The Caesar was easily the best I 've had, just enough dressing to wet the leaves but no clumps, just enough cheese and garnish ( bacon) to dress the dish up.</li><li>They brought the wrong dish out for my husband.</li><li>After he came back and sat down, a staff person walked over to our table and said she had punched in the wrong dish and there was a price discrepancy between what he 'd ordered and what he 'd been charged ( the piadina he wanted was a couple of dollars more than the dish he 'd been charged for).</li><li>After he came back and sat down, a staff person walked over to our table and said she had punched in the wrong dish and there was a price discrepancy between what he 'd ordered and what he 'd been charged ( the piadina he wanted was a couple of dollars more than the dish he 'd been charged for).</li><li>This dish was flavorful and had its creamy touch.</li><li>Ordered: Porkbelly BBQ ( Sam Kyup Sal)* Pork belly BBQ served with mushrooms, onions and veggies for wrapping* You cook this on a BBQ grill at your

plate of fresh to made Korean pancake as the first side dish and it was delicious!</li><li>For the main dish, I ordered beef bibimbap.</li><li>They offer more varieties of these little dishes than most: a salty dish of greens, bean sprouts, kimchi, chap chae/clear glass noodles, a pickled and spicy cucumber, a whole pancake the size of your hand, plus more.</li><li>Lots of side dishes and ' service' ( free dish on the house).</li><li>They served a good number of side dishes to enjoy along with the main dish.</li><li>Our fav go-to dish is the bulgogi table cooking.</li><li>However the table was quite small and made our eating space quite tight ... maybe we should have only ordered one type of dish.</li><li>Boo Daw Jung Gol ~ Kimchi hotpot with all the ingredients you can think of and it will varied from restaurants. ~ Here, there 's beansprout, sausage, spam, mushrooms, veggies and of course the instant noodle. ~ It 's as if you raid the fridge in the middle of the night for things to add to your instant noodle. ~ This is the ultimate dish to end a rather heavy drinking night;) Dduk Bok Gi ( Spicy Rice Cake) ~ With fish cake slices, all immerse in a thick spicy sauce. ~ Filling, yummy and cheap dish that I will never get tired of.</li><li>Boo Daw Jung Gol ~ Kimchi hotpot with all the ingredients you can think of and it will varied from restaurants. ~ Here, there 's

first time trying this and it could be i do n't like this dish in general.</li><li>Corn with Cheese- 3/5- This dish was alright.</li><li>A large dish can serve around people.</li><li>Another notable dish was the rice cakes with mussels, I know my girlfriend thoroughly enjoyed these little bites !!</li><li>This dish was a bit plain to me, not that exciting.</li><li>We ordered the special half &amp; half chicken ( $ 27.99)- fried chicken, and fried chicken in spicy sauce, as our main dish.</li><li>I 'd say that this dish was more than enough for two people, as we left with a few leftover pieces.</li><li>I always ordered the Boneless Fried Chicken with Green Onion which is their signature dish here.</li><li>Vegetable biryani- I was most happy with this dish.</li><li>Because Pakistani restos always seem to `` forget'' to give me my lime when I order the dish ( which is disappointing when you live a 15 min drive from from the location and only got take out in the first place because you had no food at home ( including limes)).</li><li>They must have saved it for this dish.</li><li>- It is a great dish to munch over some iced cold beer, sharing with your friends and just talks about nonsense !!</li><li>The bbq pork in the dish is the worst bbq pork I 've ever had in my whole life.</li><li>There was also whipped cream on the side for serving, but with such a heavy dish, I did not need to use them at all!</li><li>My main pet peeve with the dish is that there was way too much whipped cream on the plate/in the crepe AND it was definitely not real whipped cream.</li><li>The dish in general is not overly sweet; just right in my opinion.</li><li>Free wifi, and prices falls within the $ 10-13 range per dish.</li><li>The whole dish was pure heaven in my mouth.</li><li>The sprinkling of cereal is a creative touch to the dish, adding nice texture.</li><li>I did notice a minimum charge of $ 5 per person, though this did n't apply to us even though we shared 1 dish but it 's something to keep in mind.</li><li>The presentation of the dish was great but the red bean inside the crepe not very well distributed, I did n't eat a single red bean until i got through half the crepe.</li><li>The portions are more than enough for two, however since my counterpart was full I ended up pigging out and finishing the dish lol.</li><li>Their ice-cream is good, but the proportion is very little and unbalance to the whole dish!</li><li>I highly recommend this dish.</li><li>I was not able to finish my dish.</li><li>Most recommended dish will be obviously their pho dac biet ( special famous beef noodle soup) with all the works including thinly sliced beef, beef balls, beef shank, beef tendon ( mmm my favourite!) and noodle with lots of bean sprouts and mint.</li><li>Overall, it 's a well-put together dish.</li><li>My friend ordered the Chicken Pad Thai, and that dish I have to admit from what I tasted was somewhat disappointing.</li><li>Just not a good dish, and my friend was visibly not enjoying his dish.</li><li>Just not a good dish, and my friend was visibly not enjoying his dish.</li><li>Great dish for a cold day.</li><li>The meat was poorly cooked, and the portion size laughable, it was atop a mound of bean sprouts making this dish look larger than it was.</li><li>It is hardly possible to go wrong with such a staple dish, right ?</li><li>The chicken in this dish was cubed white meat with no seasoning and utterly flavorless.</li><li>Luckily, they offered the spicy Korean red pepper paste that usually comes with this dish and even then, it did not mask the sub par flavor.</li><li>We waited over an hour for our dish and in the end we ended up cancelling it.</li><li>Very sad looking prawns in way too much garlic ( and I like garlic, but this dish could kill a vampire).</li><li>This dish is an ideal option if you are watching your figure, or if you want something fresh and balanced.</li><li>Yes, that would n't be appealing, of course it can happen even in the fanciest place, and I just would n't go back if they would n't offer to exchange the dish.</li><li>It 's just the perfect spicy dish for brunch.</li><li>This is an extremely filling dish, so you 've been warned!</li><li>Instead of japanese accompanying the english descriptions on the pastic menus, each dish was followed by a chinese translation.</li><li>I did think that the sushi was fresher and the dish I ordered was definitely prepared much better than most places.</li><li>The baby squids werent babies at all but one giant squid though it was the most successful dish of them all.</li><li>It was a nice dish when some of the spicy sauce was mixed in; the pot crisped the rice nicely, and the veggies were fresh.</li><li>98% of the time when I come around this area is because I 'm craving for this dish.</li><li>The menu is relatively simple, it 's pretty much just one page and features their main dish- the Soon Tofu.</li><li>A dish comes with rice and water is added to the bowl the rice is originally served is making a congee-esque dish ( not sure what it 's called but it 's tasty!).</li><li>A dish comes with rice and water is added to the bowl the rice is originally served is making a congee-esque dish ( not sure what it 's called but it 's tasty!).</li><li>Still the dish was put together well and it was quite unique the banchan.</li><li>Although the menu is really limited, you should probably know that this restaurant is only known for its single type of dish.</li><li>Shortly after I got my dish, the restaurant started to get packed and a line up was forming!</li><li>Asked for refill for the side dish ( kimchi, pickled radish, bean sprout and some korean seed that I do n't know what it 's called).</li><li>Once we sat down and ordered, it took another 45 minutes for the last dish to arrive. 多伦多最好吃的豆腐汤没有之一 ！ ！ 必须点extra spicy kimchi ！ ！ 小菜味道也不错 ！ 汤的味道好吃到可以让我吃完整整一碗饭 ， 而且我喜欢把饭舀出来放进汤里吃汤泡饭 ， 实在太美味了 ！ the most delicious Korean tofu soup in Toronto ！ ！ Best Tofu house ever.</li><li>There are basically only 3 menu options- bibimbap, bulgogi and soon tofu ( 5 versions of soon tofu but still basically the same dish).</li><li>The stone pot with the now crispy rice bits and hot water was like a little bonus dish.</li><li>I ordered the dumpling hot pot and my friends picked out the kimchi hot pot ( one ventured into the super spicy realm and was very pleased with their dish), and all of them were great.</li><li>It 's an excellent ( and I believe, healthy) dish that is definitely satisfying during a cold winter 's day.</li><li>When we were ready to finally order I wanted to get a dish a little spicier ( which they 've done before) he told me that they do n't do that any more.</li><li>Before they brought the dish, they placed a couple side dishes on the table and 2 eggs.</li><li>They then brought the main dish that was sizzling hot.</li><li>I sometimes see foreigners using chopstick and they start eating without mixing it, but unless you like it like that for some reason, the dish is supposed to be enjoyed mixed.</li><li>BUT, they make one of the best rice I have ever had, i almost always ask for extra rice and i do n't know if the hot stone pot is the magic to it all, but the rice seems to compliment everything dish perfectly.</li><li>But now I wo n't have a reason to come back here since they do n't have the decency to admit when they 've made a mistake and served the wrong dish.</li><li>They provide for you a range of spiciness that you want your soup to be, I always tend to lean for medium! &amp; if it is your first time, your dish always comes with a egg, which you usually crack into the soup when you get it, so make sure you keep stirring until its cooked or to your preference.</li><li>I 've never really ate their sizzling meat dish ( Bulgogi).</li><li>Do note that this dish, unlike the soon tofu 's, does n't come with an egg.</li><li>Very limited vegetarian/vegan options, but they will change the dish to suit your needs so that was nice, and I got a 30% off coupon so I might go back to give it one more try and if the food gets any better I will update this post.</li><li>If they had a sale for $ 1 a dish, I would n't even buy it, not even to feed a dog!</li><li>Sausage dish was terrible and the vegetables were even worse.</li><li>I stood there waiting for her to finish making my dish.</li><li>If you love pasta and do n't want to shell out $ 18-25 for a dish, I recommend Boston Pizza.</li><li>For the price I pay, their dish is so small and does n't have a lot of ingredients.</li><li>Their namesake dish- pizza, was not impressive.</li><li>The problem with reviewing pizza is that it 's what I consider a `` simple'' dish.</li><li>I can buy a pack of chicken fingers and some fries from the grocery store and make the same dish myself.</li><li>When she received her dish, the food was already cold.</li><li>The dish itself is A-OK, and comes out pretty fast since everyone is ordering it.</li><li>Love the fact that each dish comes with rice and you do n't have to pay extra like other places.</li><li>We also got some well made cabbage and cucumber that comes with every dish.</li><li>Generally, we come for the dish that this restaurant is probably best known for which is the Pork Bone Soup.</li><li>I have found that the quality of this dish has been consistently good every time I have ordered it.</li><li>But my favorite favorite dish will always be their Gam Ja Tang ( Pork Bone soup with a bowl of rice).</li><li>I 'm not sure if it 's because the expectations were raised higher due to people praising how good it was, but I did n't enjoy the broth, or any part of the dish, actually. it just was n't as flavorful as I 'd have liked.</li><li>You order a dish, and either five bottles of beer or a bottle of soju for a set price.</li><li>The waitress brought us the dish with a mountain of pickled radish, another waitress passed by and said ohh and took it back and returned with a smaller one.</li><li>Also, only kimchee as the side dish.</li><li>I know they only charge $ 6 for the bowl of stew, but I expected a little more side dish.</li><li>Pork bone soup is a must and it 's one of the cheapest dish on the menu.</li><li>Personally, when I find a dish I like I just stick to it.</li><li>The BBB was I thought not very tasty, all the vegetables tasted roughly the same with the buttery taste, and overall the dish was mediocre.</li><li>People should order this dish more often.</li><li>That dish is absolutely amazing and typically everyone is very nice and friendly.</li><li>We sent back the dish and in doing so, was treated like garbage.</li><li>I 'm going to put the same amount of energy and thought into writing this review as they did preparing my meal.- horrible attitude from the staff team, not a single trace of politeness ( slams menu on the table, rude comments and demeanor, etc)- dish came in a dirty bowl- was the standard for hygiene this low ? ( See picture below)- dish had a distinct taste of cigarette ash- I paid in cash and before I was able to collect my change, the waitress tried to take the money away and asked ( still rudely) if I was going to leave her a 40% tip.</li><li>I mean it 's like your signature dish that is lit in neon on your window for over 20 years, at least do n't screw up this bad.</li><li>After having vacationed in Vietnam, I can say the dish is 75% authentic.</li><li>But this dish was not that good due to the strong flavor of turmeric in the dish.</li><li>But this dish was not that good due to the strong flavor of turmeric in the dish.</li><li>I would n't have made them remake the dish, but at least acknowledge that it was n't what I ordered instead of making the customer feel stupid.</li><li>Another dish is their Peking Duck.</li><li>They do n't come and pick up your plates when the dish is empty.</li><li>Try the rice cake: it 's sliced rice tubes with cabbage and protein, and while looks may be deceiving, this dish was really pleasant.</li><li>A dish that was good but portion was a little light ( esp for the price) was the snow pea leaves with king mushrooms.</li><li>This Crystal Pork Aspic is an interesting dish.</li><li>I just remember having this dish at some other restaurant, and it was thicker, with more dried shrimp, more spice, more flavor.</li><li>The second time, my dish came out way ahead of my friends ( and while it 's not typical for Chinese restaurants to serve food at the same time, it 's got to be within 5-10 minutes) and my food came about 15 minutes ahead of my friend 's dish.</li><li>Pros: great food, lots of variety of dish Cons: loudness of clanging utensil at the back &amp; lack of good service.</li><li>Note, rice cakes in general are hard to reheat as they stick together and become quite hard- try to finish this dish and not take it home.</li><li>The sauteed snow pea shoots ( dow mui) was really good, but a simple dish.</li><li>This dish is a mixture of rice cakes, cabbage and small strips of pork.</li><li>I love that dish and the last time I was there, I came walking in through the mall and two men seated at the front immediately noticed me and stood up to greet me and were so friendly/helpful.</li><li>Bottom line, a return visit is in order, and hopefully the service wo n't be a mirage. ( pun intended) Went in for a quick dinner weeknight, our server was real nice and cheerful, ordered the pizza ( as it was listed as freshly made in the kitchen) and did not disappoint. there was abit of an accident on the ocean harvest ( and there were way too much of grilled pepper in the dish), but the manager got it taken care of for us diligently.</li><li>Now I see why this was a `` signature dish.''</li><li>The Penne dish was an all around enjoyable dish that I would recommend to anyone craving a lightly flavored, heavier cream sauce with their pasta- it 's a safe bet.</li><li>Amazing Calamari and phenomenal home made pasta with mushrooms, amazing dish called Gemilli Funghi.</li><li>While I love this dish at other locations, the panini wrap was under-cooked and cold in certain areas, as if it were microwaved.</li><li>That would be a better representation of what the dish really is.</li><li>There was, however, a fabulous selection of fruit served with my eggs which really rounded out this dish.</li><li>As for the food, the most popular dish I saw was gamjatang.</li><li>We waited a good 25 minutes for our food to arrive after ordering and when my friend asked for a refill on their awesome potatoes side dish, the waitress gave us the cut eye and threw the dish on our table ( maybe this lady was having a bad day but she was pretty rude).</li><li>We waited a good 25 minutes for our food to arrive after ordering and when my friend asked for a refill on their awesome potatoes side dish, the waitress gave us the cut eye and threw the dish on our table ( maybe this lady was having a bad day but she was pretty rude).</li><li>The dish was $ 18.99 but most of it was batter and fat.</li><li>The Big Beef Rib ( Kalbi) dish #46 ( approx.</li><li>I love seeing this dish at other restaurants with BIG pieces of meat ATTACHED to the RIB bone itself.</li><li>TIP #2- They provide each guest with a glass of watered-down Tea which you 'll drink often to clear your tastebuds from one dish to another however if you remember the service, you should ask for a TEA POT of Tea so you can serve yourselves rather than wait to get their attention and for them to take your cup inside to refill.</li><li>I would understand her behaviour if she was trying to serve my friend her meal and wanted to ensure there was something under the dish.</li><li>Maybe I just ordered a bad dish ..</li><li>The dish was mostly onions, with a few pieces of chicken that were mostly gristle, connective tissue and cartilage.</li><li>I went rogue and tried a dish I 've never had before: Took Baeki Bulgoki ( $ 7.99).</li><li>This was a thick, beastly dish.</li><li>I 've ordered many soup stone bowls from their menu and all are good, and I usually pick them based on whether I feel like having a spicy dish or not that day.</li><li>Not the best dish but definitely a gokd value for the amount served.</li><li>I believe I had two bites before abandoning the dish completely.</li><li>What I like the best about this place is their appetizer salad that they serve you before any dish you order.</li><li>Probably back there even tomorrow to try the second dish I like at Hakka ... General Tso-Toe-Tow-So-or whatever ( they really need to figure out a standard way to spell his name!).</li><li>My mother-in-law is mostly a vegetarian ( and the Persian menu is meat heavy) so she had the Risotto Primavera ( $ 15.95) and seemed very happy with her dish.</li><li>He also said regardless of the side I 'd get I 'd get a baked tomato but no baked tomato came with my dish!</li><li>Served me a wrong dish, and blamed the ambiguity in the menu and implicitly my ignorance for the problem.</li><li>On the one hand they make a really excellent North American style pad thai that is Saucy and delicious, and their Gai Yang grilled chicken is a great example of the dish.</li><li>They also used cabbage which is not a common ingredient for this dish.</li><li>If there were any black truffles in the dish, I did n't taste them.</li><li>They used a chocolate sauce to do up a Happy Birthday along the rim of the dish which was a nice touch for our special lady!</li><li>I asked the owner which one was better, and he immediately said the loin of venison without giving a reason- was this because it was the more expensive dish ?</li><li>Pros: Food were decent in price and every dish was good in taste and proportions.</li><li>The dish was okay, but the only memorable aspect was the price.</li><li>I 'm not sure about you, but I kinda expect more than 2 grams of protein in whatever dish I generally order.</li><li>Just stop for a quick lunch for the first time in this place and I got the golden chicken curry that is one of the best I ever had, did n't expect that quality dish on a fast food restaurant.</li><li>They were very fast and the prices is friendly.i will definitely will comeback here when I 'm in the area. ( spicy dish) A regular at this place.</li><li>My coworker who ordered the Spicy Cashew Chicken really enjoyed his dish, though.</li><li>I often order this dish as a small meal or a tie-over and Thai One On always uses hearty, fresh ingredients.</li><li>What I got: French toast with chocolate chips ( 3/5): A decent dish of egg soaked bread with melted chocolate chips on top, a side of ham and a side of fruit.</li><li>This location is not as convenient as their other locations if you are driving but perfect if you are using public transit as it is close to North York Station. stopped in this place for some apps and cake and we ended up with stomach aches. the whole experience was a dissapointment. we had clamari which was rubbery and a small portion. i am a huge calamari fan and this dish was a huge dissapointment. i have had calamari at the brampton symposium many times and loved it everytime. we also had a pita bread pizza type bread with gouda and chicken. the gouda was shredded and sparring. the chicken lacked flavour and fell off the pita with each bite due to lack of cheese to meld it all together. the cheescake was ok. it was extremely soft, nearly a mouse texture and it lacked the delicious graham cracker bottom which is my fav part of cheesecake. the chocolate caramel cake was also a mousse like texture. the caramel was drizzled on top and was eaten in two bites by my 4 year old. the cake lacked any other caramel flavour. it was a large piece and most of it was left behind. i ordered a steamed milk to go with the cake and they forgot to serve it. one star is generous for this place. i would give it a zero if i could.</li><li>Two stars tops based on my dish- Stuffed eggplant.</li><li>Beer makes me happy. this was ok --- SUMMARY --- Plus 's: good place to hang out, decent food, Minus 's: sitting on the patio means breathing all the car exhaust from the cars on Yonge street --- MORE DETAILS --- we choose a platter for two ... it consisted of: very tender chicken ( i picked it up and a piece of meat fell off- SO TENDER) first time i had cornbread- it looked burnt on the bottom, so i just ate the top part not bad ( it would n't ' be my first choice) pulled pork was ok chicken wings were fairly good beef brisket was pretty good .. ribs were kinda dry ... in the end everything kinda tasted the same. fries were good- not too salty stepping in, the restaurant itself is nice, there are booths or table seating indoors. the main window is a garage front that opens into the patio area facing yonge st. interior has exposed beam ceilings and there 's many nostalgic memorabilia decorated throughout. we ordered a couple of things from the menu 1. spaghetti with beef brisket- yeah i know an experimental dish but i was feeling like spaghetti and if the brisket was good -- you know that would been amazing. unfortunately the brisket was covered in tomato sauce so I could n't taste it in it 's full glory or not ..</li><li>The grill pork belly is the signature dish in house.</li><li>It 's a delicious dish for the hot sauce lover! 3.</li><li>This place is different- the owner takes the time out to explain each dish and also educates us on the difference between dishes and how it 's cook.</li><li>Nothing really to point out with this dish.</li><li>The beef and broccoli fried noodle is very tasty and mix well in the dish.</li><li>The average price of each dish is about $ 20.</li><li>Not $ 18 per dish good, but it was very tasty.</li><li>Sauteed Beef w/ Green Peppers, Black Bean &amp; Garlic Sauce: 3/5 for some reason we had a blackbean ( high) and decided to order this dish.</li><li>Best dish was the deep fried eggplant with shrimp paste.</li><li>But I was told, it was more expensive ( $ 5 each dish, as opposed to avg $ 3- but see how you can get a VIP discount card!)</li><li>-White tuna tataki, this dish is very plain and simple.</li><li>So today I went to order the pancake combo and was told that I could n't sub pork bacon for turkey bacon because the kitchen does n't make substitution on the `` signature dishes'' the dish is pancakes, eggs, bacon and sausage how signature is this.</li><li>Love to meet the creative chef that came up with this complex dish that it ca n't be modified.</li><li>I think I 'll try the pancakes or share a dish with someone next time.</li><li>So, already, inconsistencies for the same dish.</li><li>The desserts are average, not to die for but good if you want to round off your dinner with a cheesecake, or a Baked Alaska, a dish truly from the upper reaches of the world.</li><li>It was so tasty and wish the dish was a bit bigger!</li><li>The mayo might have been for the small salad on the dish but it was so good w/ the dumplings!</li><li>The dish was filling and satisfying, I highly recommend trying out their hotspots!</li><li>Pros: good service ( was n't too busy) variety of appetizers and good hotpot Cons: no major cons but food took some time Just like most other Korean restaurants, they have beer/soju combos which consist of 5 bottles of beer or 1 bottle of soju with one dish starting from $ 20.00 to $ 35.00.</li><li>I really liked this dish!</li><li>We got the combo that included 4 beers with a choice of a dish.</li><li>Overall, my dish was good but not better than those at the places I frequent.</li><li>Service- 1 star Cleanliness- 2 stars Food- 3 stars ( based on my dish only) Overall ?</li><li>http://www.zenkimchi.com/FoodJournal/news-media/shameless-self-promotion/joe-harpers-bazaar-2/ | | Budae jjigae or Johnsontang is a unique dish that originated in the hungry years after the Korean War when tins of ham, sausages and baked beans were bought on the black market around American army bases ( such as Yongsan) and mixed with noodles and vegetable scraps to make a meal.</li><li>Try it at Nolboo in Hongik. | | If that passage upsets Seoul 's tourism officials, I 've heard the dish described even less charitably as being made from food scraps fished out of the garbage.</li><li>Their own `` make your own'' dish is still the same which is good but the food at the buffet was old and stale and almost inedible.</li><li>You really have no idea what 's going to make a good dish.</li><li>How am I supposed to know what goes into making a good Mongolian dish ?</li><li>Do n't know the name but their main thing is a build your own dish ( pick from a large assortment of veggies, meats and sauces give to chef who cooks it for you on this 6-8 for wide circular flat top stove) which is incredible ... and the food too.</li><li>This is where this place wins over my previous favourite Waterloo location, instead of trying to figure out the appropriate mix and balance of herbs, sauce and oil to make a decent dressing for your dish, they have a host of pre-made sauces which explain in detail what is in each.</li><li>To reiterate on the concept mentioned by my fellow yelpers the main focus of this buffet is the DIY dish.</li><li>This place is really good ... I like how you can make your own dish and have the chef cook your dish .... The buffet is good too if you do n't trust yourself ... This is a great place to take a date.</li><li>Afternoon tea is the best deal: From 3-5pm on weekdays, order a dish from the special menu and you get a free drink.</li><li>Beware the shrimp in this dish is sometimes suspect.</li><li>They are famous for congee but the noodle, fried rice and other side dish are really worth to try.</li><li>Eel fried rice is pretty much the same in Congee queen Garoupa &amp; Fried bean curd in hot pot, now that was disappointing to have fish bones in the garoupa dish. it 's $ 13 dish and now I have to spent lots of work to spit out all those bones.</li><li>I ca n't say that there is much to the dish ... i mean its congee ... liquid rice with many other different ingredients to give it flavour.</li><li>The price for each dish was very reasonable and to feed a family of 4, very cost effective.</li><li>The congee is one of the most flavorful I 've had and the beef in the noodle dish is very tender with the noodle having that smokey pan-fried flavor.</li><li>Surprisingly the food came out decently quick and one of the server even came up and apologized for one of the dish because the bok choy were not the fresh .. so we cancelled it even though it was already made.</li><li>I usually avoid fried rice, but I found the eel fried rice to be my favorite dish- the individual ingredients blended well together, and the eel meat just made each bite better.</li><li>Marinated Chiu Chow Style Duck was good too, but skin was soft and the dish a bit salty.</li><li>- Favorite noodle: beef &amp; black bean, or shrimp in scrambled egg sauce- Favorite rice: smoked salmon, or yin-yang rice- Favorite side dish: snow pea greens &amp; oyster mushrooms, spicy fried garoupa, wonton in soup, shrimp &amp; chive rice noodle rolls Portions are bigger in the restaurant than if you order takeout, but huge either way:) You ca n't get better food for such a good price!</li><li>The dish is enough for two meals.</li><li>The sauce made the lamb taste like dish detergent so I 'm not sure what Rosemary sauce was used but rosemary does NOT taste like that.</li><li>There was a total of one scallop in that whole dish.</li><li>The Lamb Vindaloo was pretty spicy and those who can take the heat will like this dish.</li><li>When it 's BAD it 's stale, or really bland, or utterly disappointing because it 's not what you 'd expect the dish to be at all.</li><li>For mains I had a Prawn Jalfrezi, the prawns had absolutely no flavour so the dish was dependent on the mixture of peppers and onions for flavour and the sauce.</li><li>Did not work and I did not even bother finishing the dish.</li><li>The food is amazing, right from the salad, to the pickled goods, to your main dish.</li><li>When our food arrived my dish was massive!</li><li>My boyfriend liked his steak and eggs, but I think we can both agree that my dish was better!</li><li>But if you try to order a small dish or appetizer, the waitress usually gives some convoluted story about how magnetic forces are n't aligned and how it is n't available.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
