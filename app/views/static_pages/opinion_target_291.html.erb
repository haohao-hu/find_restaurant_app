<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 291' %><h2>chicken balls<br />occurrence: 19</h2><div><ol><li>Oh, and their chicken balls are quite bland.</li><li>Sweet and sour chicken balls were what saved this meal in my opinion.</li><li>The person working never tried to up-sell me anything extra such as spring rolls or a side of chicken balls, but I 'm almost wishing she did just so I could pig out more and blame her.</li><li>Their menu has an array of choices ( from their classic chicken balls to their noodle dishes) and every meal has been delicious so far!</li><li>Chicken balls are perfectly golden crisp with a generous piece of white meat chicken which comes with a huge vat of sweet and sour sauce ( red sauce to some).</li><li>Skip the chow mein ( bean sprouts) and go for the Cantonese chow mein .... and the chicken balls too, lol.</li><li>When I ordered the combo plate for one chicken balls, I got two chicken balls with hardly any red sauce.</li><li>I 'm of the opinion that Thai food in Toronto is sort of like Chinese food in a small town: all chicken balls and chop suey.</li><li>Dishes we tried: Vegetable fried rice, Scallion pancake ( so yummy!), Chicken balls, spare ribs, vermicelli with chicken and more.</li><li>I usually go on Tuesday night because that 's the night chicken balls are offered and they are really tasty! unlike most Canadian Chinese places who all seem to use frozen portion packed chicken balls that are hard and all batter with straight up ketchup sauce here is different.</li><li>I usually go on Tuesday night because that 's the night chicken balls are offered and they are really tasty! unlike most Canadian Chinese places who all seem to use frozen portion packed chicken balls that are hard and all batter with straight up ketchup sauce here is different.</li><li>The chicken balls are very soft and have a `` fresh'' taste to them and the sauce is sweet and does n't taste like ketchup.</li><li>Now I would never complain about that ratio ... but here 's the kicker ( s): The breaded strips of chicken had a very odd, smoky flavour which after a hesitant second bite, revealed itself to be a strip of bacon wrapped around the chicken ( um, Jewish neighbourhood and no mention of it on the menu), the two chicken wings had a distinctive metallic flavour, the pork ribs were terribly chewy and dry, the shrimp had a mealy, thick dough around them that was n't even fully cooked through and had a terrible, raw-fish smell and taste that lingered in my mouth for an hour afterward and the chicken balls were ok.</li><li>We ordered some rice and some chicken balls, The rice was fine, but the chicken balls were a bit dry.</li><li>The chicken balls can be good or very doughy ...</li><li>Their chicken balls are really good too!</li><li>Their chicken wings, fried rice, chicken balls, sweet and sour chicken are very good !!!</li><li>In addition to the Mongolian BBQ section the do offer a fairly robust selection of Western Chinese faves ( you know like chicken balls and spare ribs and spring rolls) good for the us white folk who know no difference.</li><li>I also loved the chicken balls.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
