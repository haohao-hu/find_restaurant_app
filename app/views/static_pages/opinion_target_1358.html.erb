<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1358' %><h2>cottage<br />occurrence: 2</h2><div><ol><li>CAFE:- no cafe menu, only one type of coffee ( I never order it, so I do n't know what it is)- there 's no wifi, no need to fight for power outlets ... since there are n't any,:)- the lounge tables are super spacious and comfy, tables are large, great for all sorts of work, from textbooks, tax forms, to picture gallery work- mostly quiet environment, unless we 're talking busy meal times RESTO:- yes, decor 's a little ' unique', think rustic cottage- washroom 's a little cramped- they regularly accommodate for large tables, work with you to come up with a customized menu- large room in the back if you want privacy as well- food is done well.</li><li>Massive renovations a few years ago transformed the former dive bar into an upscale cottage; a theme that carries through the Miller 's marketing efforts.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
