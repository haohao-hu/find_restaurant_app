<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 377' %><h2>Lunch Special<br />occurrence: 13</h2><div><ol><li>Their Lunch Special did n't make it hard for me to give them a try.</li><li>Though the Lunch Special here starting from $ 5.99 which is great prices but I would not be back again.</li><li>Their lunch special is cheap.</li><li>As another reviewer mentioned, the lunch special ( which has always been the same chicken teriyaki and california roll every time I 've been), brings lunch in under $ 10 and definitely does the trick of filling you up.</li><li>Got the following: 1) Lobster bisque $ 9 2) Chicken satays aka chicken skewers $ 7 ( 3 pieces) 3) Crispy beef panang curry $ 13 ( lunch time only price) 4) Thai style beef wrap with mango salad $ 13 ( lunch special- Jennifer K. loves lunch specials) The lobster bisque was the real deal.</li><li>The lunch special is very okay.</li><li>Unlike the decor, the food is ' updated' and their lunch special are delicious.</li><li>If you get there between 12pm-5pm on Tuesday to Fridays, you can get the lunch special including a drink and a crÃªpe for $ 10.99.</li><li>I recommend going there on weekdays because they have a lunch special: ( savoury or desert crepes with a latte for only around 10.99 + salad) Service is always good, and the food is even better.</li><li>Pros: Has lunch specials and dinner specials, food came out quickly, tempura and japchae was yummy Cons: miso soup was too salty, the waitress sat me in a booth and did n't check up on me once the food came, did n't get a water refill, no banchan or kimchi, skimped on the Kalbi for the lunch special If you 're looking for a place in the area that serves Korean food for the same price, your best bet would be the Seoul house on Orfus Rd. You might said I 'm picky but I do n't think I would come back to this place.</li><li>Decided to go here because they have the lunch special till 4pm everyday.</li><li>The lunch special is enough food to last me 2-3 days of lunches at work.</li><li>Usually come in for the lunch special which is pretty good and economically priced.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
