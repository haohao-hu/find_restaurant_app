<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 108' %><h2>chefs<br />occurrence: 54</h2><div><ol><li>The chefs are your friends mother and they make excellent, authentic, honest food as if you were sitting at their house saturday night.</li><li>Was immediate seated and welcomed by a friendly hello from the chefs.</li><li>Was immediately seated and welcomed by a friendly hello from the chefs.</li><li>Much more fresh and I feel like the chefs put more care into slicing sashimi and making rolls.</li><li>The chefs seem to be Korean and I do n't think they make their own soy sauce.</li><li>Needless to say I will not be returning to this restaurant, it 's just another sushi place where the chefs could care less about the quality of the food, but it is still able to stay profitable due to inexperienced sushi eaters.</li><li>The chefs are well kept and are very into to what they are producing.</li><li>The chefs really know what they 're doing and their plating is traditional.</li><li>Staff: Chefs were busy as well as pre-occupied with sports on television sets.</li><li>The quality and taste of the food is always consistent, fabulous chefs here.</li><li>The combination of flavours and textures that the chefs are able to produce are second to none.</li><li>I think they 've changed chefs or receipes the empanadas ordered today was awfully drenched with oil bad oil as matter of fact and the stuffing inside was salty and tasteless was a bad experience do n't think I 'll be coming back here for my empenada craving Waited 30 minutes for two pupusas and 40 minutes for ceviche and yuca con chicharon, the yuca and chicharon was probably fried with old oil.</li><li>The idea is interesting, but whoever these chefs are in the kitchen, clearly has never been to China and had a real Spring Roll.</li><li>Over all, a nice place but if we come back, we 'll be sure to order something different next time! ok it 's no fluke the wood oven pizza here is very good. ( we ordered two kinds to try) the dough, sauce and cheese the base ingredients of most any pizza are top notch. the crust i would describe .. it 's not a thin where it 's paper thin and it 's not cooked crisp like I 've had at many other thin crust pizza places. having its so crisp hides the true identity of the pizza dough. how can one taste the crust if it 's burnt !? the crust is thin where one can bite into the dough know it 's dough and not thick enough to not overwhelm the toppings. my quattro stagione was made wrong though .. it suppose to be separate quarters of pizza with the individual toppings. but instead it was a pizza with all the toppings. c 'mon just because I do n't look italian does n't mean I do n't know how it 's suppose to be. do n't give me stupid excuses that things get roughed up in the oven that why that make it that way ? i do n't care for the chatty waitress here and the ridiculous excuses, but as i mentioned in my first review. i will come here for the food because the cooks and chefs in the back know what they are doing ..</li><li>Delicious cuts of fish are prepared and presented by proper sushi chefs.</li><li>The waiter then said the chefs are putting all other orders on hold and cooking ours first.</li><li>You re coming here for a 5-star experience because every step of the way you 're greeted by lovely staff members, chefs, and customers.</li><li>The food was good but the chefs very touching everything with their hands.</li><li>The chefs are amazing and when they heard my one friend was n't having eggs, they surprised him with a super fancy grilled cheese stacked with yummy vegs.</li><li>There is n't much of a wait time, the chefs make the sushi fairly fast even when there 's a huge line.</li><li>The chefs definitely piled on my veggies very generously and even after sharing my meal, I was very full!</li><li>You also can see the chefs making your food which is a plus.</li><li>The chefs here casually adorn whatever smells clean as there is no such thing as uniforms in this restaurant.</li><li>Juggling around the salt and pepper shakers, lighting fireballs of random things, breaking eggs in a really cool way, it 's all really fun and the chefs look like they are having a good time as well.</li><li>Well, I was walking through the parking lot, when I noticed two of the chefs out front having a cigarette break.</li><li>And no chefs farted at me.</li><li>I always find the chefs and servers to be very friendly as well.</li><li>Because of the way the tables are designed there are ( ideally) two chefs standing back-to-back, each facing their teppanyaki grills, surrounding by a C-shaped arrangement of chairs.</li><li>I say ideally, as since there are at least a dozen tables going at once, there are more tables than there are available chefs.</li><li>The chefs are always funny --- there was one who was singing `` Like A Virgin'', which we thought was hilarious.</li><li>Some of the chefs are fun, some are really boring, no tricks at all.</li><li>If expecting more groups, they should make sure they have enough chefs to accommodate the groups.</li><li>There were two chefs, the first chef did tricks and was a great host!</li><li>The chefs in the back really work hard to deliver delicious Italian food.</li><li>They seem to be severely understaffed in the kitchen .. please, make your resto smaller if you do n't have enough chefs to serve your customers within 15min.</li><li>My family and I have never ate at the teppenyaki area of the restaurant ... we do not need to see chefs juggling eggs and pepper shakers- we will leave that for the cirque du soleil.</li><li>The chefs needs a but more training to deliver much more fun during the cooking, which that 's all about this type of service.</li><li>On the other hand, all chefs are kind and always smiling, that 's a good vibe for the food Time warp experience, same place as 20 years ago.</li><li>The special things that chefs should do to make the experience unique and creative.</li><li>The chefs were really nice and friendly, but for the lowly $ 68 prix fix dinner, it 's not worth it.</li><li>I 've been to other teppanyaki places where the chefs do neat things with all their cooking utensils to show off their skills. such as, balancing an egg on the tip of their spatula, or dishing out food right into the mouth of a willing audience member, etc.</li><li>They also have some very interesting teppanaki bars with chefs and the whole works but I have yet to try that.</li><li>Also the restaurant comes along with a section where you can sit in a private room and have 1-2 personal chefs cooking in front of you ( called Tepanyaki) Next time we go, we will definitely try it out.</li><li>Keep in note- the owner and servers, and I assume the chefs, ar n't Japanese.</li><li>There is also another section to the restaurant where the chefs make food at your table.</li><li>If you are at a teppanyaki table, it 's great, and watching the chefs prepare the food is fun.</li><li>The grill is a large round stone cooking surface where the `` chefs'' use to prepare your carefully chosen delectables.</li><li>Finally the `` chefs'' appear to be a surly lot.</li><li>I am one of many who love the Mongolian Grill concept, where you pick your own ingredients, meats or seafood, add tons of fresh veggies, plus noodles, sauces, and condiments, and hand your choices off to the chefs who will sizzle it up for you, on their 700 degree flat top.</li><li>The grill time is pretty quick because it 's such a big one and chefs seemed pretty experienced.</li><li>At any busy evening there are 30 chefs in the kitchen woking up seriously delicious Southern Chinese cuisines, there is never a long wait for food, and the consistency of quality is perhaps the reason why this location has thrived since inception.</li><li>I am a slave to the chefs here.</li><li>Congee Queen and Congee Star) as chefs left Congee Wong to start up their own operations.</li><li>This place has been around for probably 10 years and the chefs have changed from time to time, but still the same owner ..</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
