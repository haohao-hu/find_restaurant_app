<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 750' %><h2>chips<br />occurrence: 6</h2><div><ol><li>The chips are old school- first oil-blanched and then crispy fried to perfect.</li><li>Then the Halibut with Chips were disappointing.</li><li>Still, the food is so amazing and fresh, I still give this place FIVE STARS ALL DAY, SON!*****. the place is very clean. the fish i had was very fresh and the batter was very crispy. we also ordered the chicken pie which was good but the pie was taken out of the fridge in front of us and taken to the cook to be heated up. nothing special about the pie, a bit expensive in my opinion. it cost more than the fish. chips, fish and whatever has to be ordered separately. we did get free slices of brown bread with butter on the side. i just wish that they give a bit more on the plate than just a fish. weird.</li><li>Fish and chips have always been good as has the service.</li><li>The complimentary chips were nice too.</li><li>Found the food a tad bit salty, the chips did n't taste that fresh, portion sizes are large yes, but I 'd rather pay less and get less food because I did n't require that much food.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
