<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 79' %><h2>environment<br />occurrence: 99</h2><div><ol><li>Definitely not when looking for the type of environment I was aiming for.</li><li>La Rosa Chilena is a cute, quaint, and clean environment.</li><li>The Friendly House is a 24/7 diner that offered good service in a quiet environment.</li><li>The company, enhanced by good service and a comfortable environment helped us to enjoy a pleasant and relaxed break with our friends.</li><li>I will recoment this place as it is big and if you do not mind the busy environment and the noise for doing work this is a good location and I will recoment it.</li><li>5. good environment, could have better seats.</li><li>CAFE:- no cafe menu, only one type of coffee ( I never order it, so I do n't know what it is)- there 's no wifi, no need to fight for power outlets ... since there are n't any,:)- the lounge tables are super spacious and comfy, tables are large, great for all sorts of work, from textbooks, tax forms, to picture gallery work- mostly quiet environment, unless we 're talking busy meal times RESTO:- yes, decor 's a little ' unique', think rustic cottage- washroom 's a little cramped- they regularly accommodate for large tables, work with you to come up with a customized menu- large room in the back if you want privacy as well- food is done well.</li><li>Other than that, environment is decently relaxing with an upbeat music playing in the background.</li><li>Pros: friendly environment Nice server Reasonable price Cons: Bad food quality Everything was good but the food!</li><li>The staff seem a bit frazzled and mechanic, making the environment a bit cold and dull.</li><li>Franchise experience should be consistent, the environment, food all has been predetermined, it 's usually the staff that can make it or break it for a location.</li><li>They serve those giant boat plated platters here, but the environment was too trendy for this kind of food.</li><li>The environment is a bit louder than usual and classy.</li><li>Considering the environment and the quality of the food.</li><li>The environment is more for a chilling + talking and drinking alcohol place rather than a dinner place.</li><li>It is also a good place to meet someone as the environment and decor is pretty nice.</li><li>The environment does n't really stand out too much the food definitely makes up for it.</li><li>Gone is the warm, cozy environment of an Italian restaurant, now it just looks like a modern cafe.</li><li>The environment was quite and slightly dim, great for small groups.</li><li>Although it 's a small restaurant with not too many tables, I still like its environment and ambiance, simple and comfortable.</li><li>Also, the overall environment is not welcoming for dine in, recommended as a take out place.</li><li>Although the food tasted good, the price is a little bit higher than average, considering the restaurant 's service and environment.</li><li>I gave it a 4 instead of 5 because, for the price point they charge, I would expect better service and/or better dining environment.</li><li>Second time coming here and I really love the environment.</li><li>The environment was nice.</li><li>However the truth is it is basically a regular waffle, with oreo pieces and chocolate ice cream. literally the opposite. the star they lost was due to extremely long wait time for the deserts, and also the waffles false advertisement. overall service and environment is nice, and the food was decent, so its worth a try, but probably not on a day right before a weekend perhaps.</li><li>Although the food was not great, I liked the environment and wanted to have a future gathering with my friends there.</li><li>The lighting is dim and when paired with the booths it generates an intimate environment.</li><li>I love this place the environment is amazing the seating is great.</li><li>What I really love about this place is the environment

to get bombed.</li><li>It 's a place where you can sit back, relax and take in the multisensory environment that surrounds you.</li><li>The environment, is not classy at all.</li><li>Their service and the restaurant environment was all right too.</li><li>The prices are also very fair and the environment is also super friendly.</li><li>They 're service was good, people were nice, environment was very quiet maybe because we were the only table there.</li><li>This intimate homey environment makes you feel like you 're in Italy.</li><li>I spend two hours relaxing environment, water falls and play area for kids.</li><li>The sparse and rather sterile environment was somehow warm and enticing: the sizzle of food cooking, the laughter and hum of conversations and the smiles on people 's faces added much to the otherwise drab settings.</li><li>The environment of this restaurant is pretty good.</li><li>The environment is your typical Chinese-run AYCE, tables are close to each other and relatively small dinning area.</li><li>The service and environment reminds me of an outdoor market eatery in Asia.</li><li>The environment of the place is romantic ..</li><li>The environment is old-school and rustic.</li><li>I had delivery so I cannot comment on the environment or the service of this place.</li><li>Bottom line is: the food is delicious, I 'd go back again, service is great, but the overall design and environment could be improved.</li><li>Downstairs is a more relaxed, open environment, though quite small.</li><li>The environment is cozy and tight, and by tight I mean I have difficulty getting in and out of the booths .. and I am not even a fat guy.</li><li>So you wo n't be coming here for the decor nor will you be turned away with its shady environment.</li><li>I

eyes.</li><li>The display is amazing and the environment is very authentic. decided to update my review to a 4 star.</li><li>I prefer Tastee Bread up the street as they have seating and they include a soda with their specials and do not charge extra ( also clean environment).</li><li>It has a friendly environment.</li><li>First time at Tekka Sushi, was very happy with the food, service and the environment.</li><li>If you want horrible service, dirty environment and staff who do not care, this is a place for you.</li><li>I would n't suggest the pancakes, not the best I 've had. ordered egg benedict with smoked salmon ( $ 9.99) and classic french toast ( $ 9.99) with sausage. very good food but service was a bit slow. nice environment and quiet. polite waitress.good for breakfast and brunch, a lot of couples were dining there.the hollandise sauce was a bit different from others ' diners, a little bit less sour and dense, but still we loved the taste!</li><li>It 's not exactly the most appetizing environment and you may not feel so safe hanging around this area too long.</li><li>This type of environment typically harbour such gems.</li><li>Decent quick meal in a clean environment.</li><li>Great environment, and friendly service.</li><li>You can ask for less sugar which is a plus and environment is cozy.</li><li>It is nothing better than any other bubble tea and the environment here is not the greatest.</li><li>Honestly, if you were to catch up with a friend or hang out with a group of friends, hit a cafe or a coffee shop where the prices are much lower and the service and environment are tenfolds better than places like here.</li><li>Get with it. its 2016 and I do n't care what your excuse is for serving it in a disposable cup ... you need to not to do this as it shows you do n't care about the environment.</li><li>Really nice environment ... but never coming back again.</li><li>Although the place is small it has a cozy and warm environment.</li><li>Not an ideal environment to spend time at!</li><li>Comfy environment.</li><li>Definitely a recommendation, but note that they accept cash and debit only, no credit cards. very nice brunch spot, warm cozy environment and nice food. we went in at around 11:15am on a saturday, no queue and had free booths, order two benedict natasha ( that 's egg benedict with smoked salmon and pancake instead of english muffin). we were a little bit surprised with the pancake-based benny, which turned out to be very yum !! i loved it much! we also tried to get the english muffin one, but it was not as good, a bit too toasted and crusty for benny. we would totally recommend the pancake-based ones! a 10-min walk from Lawrence subway station, it was a rather sunny and warm day so it all came to a perfect brunch day!</li><li>Environment- Clean.</li><li>The environment was a bit cramped, but it was n't bothersome.</li><li>Overall one of my favorite Korean spots in North York. love this place! friendly environment, reasonable price and delicious soup! the only thing they could work on is perhaps on the decorations inside the restaurant, but when the food is so good and fast, who cares if the walls are bare.</li><li>Though crowded and packed, it has a warm friendly environment with amazing service.</li><li>Noisy environment !!!</li><li>Environment is good.</li><li>The staff work quick to get the food and I like sitting in the quiet environment.</li><li>The cake and sangria was good but the environment and service was substandard.</li><li>CONCLUSION: Customer service is a distinguishing factor in today 's competitive environment and this restaurant does n't cut it.</li><li>Rows of low contemporary couches and cozy table settings fill this multilevel cafe and lend for a casual environment, where one can grab a coffee or a full entree.</li><li>Upon stepping into the restaurant, you can immediately feel that the environment has poor ventilation and is extremely stuffy.</li><li>The food is n't funky or fun in anyway but it 's filling and the restaurant environment is very casual.</li><li>I think they know about what sanitized environment means.</li><li>Overall, I like their environment and service ... their wings are great too! give it a try when u stop by !! =).</li><li>The environment, service and popularity of this place makes it the bar to be in the area.</li><li>Always friendly service and well executed dishes in a dated but comfortable environment, this place will be missed ( especially the pickles).</li><li>The environment was ineffective.</li><li>The environment is comfortable, spacious, tables not too close to one another, and overall size of the restaurant itself is pretty big.</li><li>Varied menu in a nice, diner environment but they are very much focused on the regular customers at the price of the occasional visitor.</li><li>Great family environment I certainly recommend this place for a family dinner.</li><li>If you want a nice dining environment or even well maintained bathrooms, you 're in the wrong part of town.</li><li>Nice, family environment that I 've been to a few times.</li><li>Great restaurant with friendly, attentive staff and a warm, welcoming environment.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
