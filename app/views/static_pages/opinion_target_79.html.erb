which almost filled me up when combined with the beer; Not going to lie.</li><li>This is almost always ordered when I 'm here with my parents as an appetizer even though it always gets brought out after the pho.</li><li>I have visited the place more than 50 times and I keep wondering how they manage to always keep around the most professional of service staff, I took 4 of my office associates out for lunch and we each ordered a drink, an appetizer and a main course, waitress serving us memorized each of our orders without writing it down, while some upscale places have up to 3 people serving a table of five and would still manage to misplace or confuse an item or two per order.</li><li>Appetizer was as expected and a good size for sharIng.</li><li>After we ordered the dinner, the server told us there 's a Sunday special- if our order is over $ 30, we will have a free appetizer.</li><li>The appetizer we ordered was a sizzler which was a pleasant surprise.</li><li>Really liked the appetizer which were some deep fried potato noodle wrapped in seaweed.</li><li>The appetizer came first with a very very small portion of the queso dip.</li><li>My appetizer was the deep fried calamari, which turned out to be the least greasy calamari I have ever had in Toronto.</li><li>Only good thing was my appetizer ( calamari) and wine of course.</li><li>Only 10% for a bad server For appetizer: got the soup of the day.</li><li>I went here with my mom yesterday, and we ordered:- appetizer- Seekh Kabab ( beef): comes on a sizzling platter, soo good- Chicken Biryani ( boneless): so delicious!</li><li>And this is an appetizer- ON THE HOUSE!</li><li>Even though this is listed on the appetizer section of the menu ... it is by no means an appetizer!</li><li>My word of warning, get the appetizer portion for the Seafood Risotto.</li><li>The Fresh Rolls are yummy too and a great appetizer to help get you started on your cure to your hangover.</li><li>For an appetizer try the garlic saut√©ed shrimps they are very tasty and the garden house salad with oil &amp; vinegar.</li><li>We were also brought the wrong appetizer though we decided to stay with it instead of sending it back.</li><li>Ive been to this restaurant numerous times and till this day still get the chicken schnitzel with the home fries, cucumber salad and the cherry streusel for dessert but the best appetizer to get is the most amazing fried cheese it is absolutely the best thing I 've had in my whole life l love going there it is one of my favourite restaurants.</li><li>The sticky rice with shredded pork is a great appetizer and the snow pea leaves are fresh and green If carbs are your thing the fried noodles and pan fried noodles dishes are big.</li><li>However, we were told that we ca n't order just the appetizer, because each table could only place one order, so we have to order all the food at the same time.</li><li>Especially considering the restaurant was n't even that busy, I do n't understand why they could n't just take our appetizer order first.</li><li>The portions for all the mains were pretty small, so we definitely needed that appetizer.</li><li>I had the pad thai, mango salad and an assorted appetizer.</li><li>We started out with the Seared Canadian Sea Scallops ( $ 18) appetizer.</li><li>Our appetizer, the bocconcini with the tomato, ( caprese ?) was good, although again, somewhat bland.</li><li>And finally the last appetizer we decided to choose was the Tom Yum Goong ( hot and sour shrimp soup), which was also very delicious and flavourful.</li><li>The mango salad was a refreshing, palette cleansing appetizer, and a hint of great things to come.</li><li>The mieng Kum appetizer is unique and great.</li><li>Disappointingly, after reassuring us that the items she had ordered were safe, her appetizer came out with cucumber ( what she is allergic to) as a garnish, which was touching her food.</li><li>Their signature appetizer- Mieng Kum is certainly very special.</li><li>Overall I was very happy with the appetizer and dessert, but very disappointed with the quinoa with duck.</li><li>I tried a appetizer, main and dessert.</li><li>The marinated beef tongue cold cuts were also a good appetizer to the main meal.</li><li>We waited 1 hr to her our appetizer, and 2 hours waiting for our main.</li><li>Anyways, fine, we decided to change our order and get lobster grandin ( appetizer $ 12), garlic jumbo shrimp ( entree $ 32), and 1 1/4 steamed lobster ( entree $ 36) for now to see how the food is then get more later if we like the foods ( yes we were that scared).</li><li>The only reason I still eat there despite its horrible service and selection of appetizer is because of their table cooking.</li><li>Meat is n't frozen.They also give you this deep fried dough fritter stuffed with shrimp paste as appetizer ..</li><li>For $ 72, the price of a large combo platter, we got a centerpiece for our appetizer station.</li><li>Also, if you sign up for their mailing list you 'll get a coupon for a free appetizer- yay!</li><li>It comes out to about the same price if you went to a higher end Italian restaurant and had one entree, free bread and half an appetizer per person.</li><li>Ive never had a pancake as an appetizer in Vancouver so I loved this little touch.</li><li>I would def come back here for the table top bbq tho. one of the best korean restaurant in town. they provide generous appetizer, and the taste of their famous pork bone soup is no where else to be found.</li><li>Did n't end up finishing it as I was full from the appetizer that the three of us shared.</li><li>Cost around $ 90.00 for 3 people to have a drink each with one appetizer and a meal per person.</li><li>We each got an appetizer, an entree, and a desert.</li><li>My friend and I were waiting for one more person to join us so we asked for the appetizer to come first before we order so we could finish up first for the people waiting outside.</li><li>I love the appetizer they give you especially the tiny black beans.</li><li>We placed an order for the appetizer right away as we were afraid we 'd have to wait a long time.</li><li>There was also a simply salad as the appetizer ?</li><li>We ordered Kashkeh Bademjan as the appetizer, the Barg, Fesenjoon and Ghaimeh.</li><li>Food arrived fast but the server did n't hear everyone 's appetizer order so I was stuck eating an appetizer alone.</li><li>Yoghurt/eggplant dip is good but could use a bit more seasoning; I find it is good if you accompany it with some of the parsley/onions given with the appetizer.</li><li>THe appetizer was good; the main was tough and overdone; the dessert was vile .. I emailed the restaurant, asking for at least a reaction ...</li><li>The appetizer was skipped and we went right to our meals.</li><li>Along with the tacos, makes a very nice appetizer or snack.</li><li>The appetizer was `` bacon wrapped mac and cheese'' we were super excited because really how can you go wrong with anything bacon:).</li><li>I should have probably read the reviews on yelp before going to the restaurant .. but I did n't .. .. btw before i get started why is there filtered reviews ? maybe i missed something ..; anyways went here for lunch with a co-worker because its close to the office .. the decor is okay and we were quickly seated but thats as good as it got .. none of the staff make eye contact, everything is slow even tho the establishment was n't busy, there was just no importance on quality .. we ordered one of the lunch specials, the pricing is good, but I learned a long time ago, you get what you pay for, so for $ 7 to $ 15 you can get a salad, appetizer, sushi, chicken/beef, dessert, etc the food was cold and really average, they forgot our sushi and when we pointed it out to the manager he said he would take it off our bill .. a whole $ 1.20 ?? for 6 sushi rolls .. like i said u get what u pay for .. my co-worker, who is from hong kong blasted the manager, but he was no help ... so i will never go back .. but the experience got me back to using yelp!;) The food is not great but the price is ok.</li><li>The servers also managed to forget the appetizer order for one of our party ... and finally delivered it to him at the same time that they were serving the main courses to the rest of us.</li><li>Ordered the duncan deluxe appetizer for two as well ( $ 55) once again have your food reflect the price you 're charging your customers.</li><li>The appetizer tray with olives, cottage cheese, and pickles was about a third of the portion we received prior to the new owners.</li><li>We had to flag down our waiter to place an order for our appetizer and when we placed our food order, it came and the meat was cooked just right &amp; the sides were obviously counted ....</li><li>We did not see a waiter through the evening unless I had to flag him down because usually there are waiters every few minutes to come by and top of your water or freshen up your appetizer tray &amp; pour your wine.</li><li>That is all I have to say ... and here is why a) Salad &amp; appetizer- coleslaw w/ Norwegian Smoked Salmon &amp; Duck Confit Coleslaw was nothing special at all.</li><li>The service was also great and I like how they bring you an appetizer when you first arrive.</li><li>For our appetizer, we ordered the gyoza which were MASSIVE and fresh: you could really taste the pork, ginger, garlic and green onion with every bite.</li><li>But if you try to order a small dish or appetizer, the waitress usually gives some convoluted story about how magnetic forces are n't aligned and how it is n't available.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
