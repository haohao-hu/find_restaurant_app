<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 817' %><h2>edamame<br />occurrence: 4</h2><div><ol><li>The edamame was good, rightly seasoned.</li><li>The edamame was nice and unsalted.</li><li>I personally thought the way the salads were presented was beautiful. really fresh fish for its low price. this sushi resaurant is actually one of the oldest in north york area since 1999 ( ? im pretty sure) when u enter, sushi bar greets u with irashaimasen and ur immediately seated by a waitress or waiter. hot green tea is usually given as soon as you seat down and after you order, some free edamame and tofu comes out. then u get the food u ordered ( fast) and ur tea is never emptied bc of the constant refill and quality checks. the place is old but i looks neat.</li><li>The edamame was way over salted.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
