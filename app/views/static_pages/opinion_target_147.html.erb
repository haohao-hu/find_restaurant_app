<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 147' %><h2>cake<br />occurrence: 46</h2><div><ol><li>I saw a tree, leaf, happy face etc. in a nice big cup. as you can see in my picture I took, not only did it not come with a little image in it, it came in a small to go type of cup. taste wise, like a vending machine but I actually did n't mind, I liked it. to the cake, do n't let my picture fool you. the size of the cake was the size of my middle and index fingers put together. taste wise, straight out of a grocery store type of cake. and not the higher end grocery stores, more like price chopper style. but again, I actually did n't mind. what I did mind was the price tag that was attached to it. it was $ 12.99 for the drink and cake combo. to recap, to go type of cup drink with vending machine taste like quality and 2 fingers size low end grocery store quality piece of cake with high end cafe prices. and I forgot to mention the table we had. we were sandwiched between 2 other tables against a half wall and had a fake plant over hang us with its fake branch half way on to our table. too bad I 'm bad a describing the actual setting we were in, should 've taken a picture ( it is worth a thousand words). so based on the above description, this place should get no more than 2 stars. but you know what, the waitress had a nice smile and was friendly. this made all the difference in the world. will I come back ... probably not. maybe it was just tonight or my luck with the food/beverage. but hard to come back here when there are so many other options in area.</li><li>I saw a tree,

plus a bunch of whipped cream.</li><li>The nuts on top of the cake were definitely not fresh because when I bit into it, I experienced a hard-to-bite somewhat chewy texture instead of the typical basic nutty crunch.</li><li>My brother said his cake was n't very flaky- I guess it may have been sitting in the window too long.</li><li>The cake tasted fresh.</li><li>I really enjoyed the cake.</li><li>The crepes are mixed with cream and a layer of airy cake.</li><li>They also have an assortment of mini individual cakes if you prefer cake over crepes.</li><li>Ice cream was not too sweet, crepe filling was delicious with bits of cake, berries and whipped cream. all the while not overly heavy.</li><li>The cakes are from Rahier- it will save you a trip but you can probably buy it elsewhere if you are craving cake.</li><li>The cake was filled with spongecake, whip cream and red bean.</li><li>He asked me when the cake is for and I told him it 's for tomorrow but I chose today to pick it up since I have a lot of running around to do tomorrow.</li><li>I call and ask to speak to the manager ( Dominic) and explain to him what happened yesterday and said I was calling to see if the cake was ready and if my Mother 's name was now spelled correctly.</li><li>When I arrived at the bakery and the lady behind the counter showed me the cake that was supposed to be corrected, HER NAME WAS SPELLED WRONG AGAIN !!!</li><li>It seem like just an italian bakery but it also service as grocery store for italian product, a restaunt for quick bites and even a corner store for small items I just went for cake, I think price is a bit high for the size but it was good cake, I dont know if I would revisit, I only stop since it was only place that would be open on sunday after 5 that i could get after work.</li><li>My GF had to switch her cake.</li><li>I love absolutely love anything that is sweet and baked, and cake is my favorite.</li><li>Management told me that the cake they gave me was a display piece and quickly gave me a new piece and comped me for it.</li><li>I ordered a piece of their chocolate explosion cake ( $ 7) to eat with my friend, but only had a few bites from the end and took the rest to go.</li><li>If you have a late-night hankering for good cake, go to Future Bakery on Bloor.</li><li>To get us cutlery for the cake that the SIL brought for my brother.</li><li>Oh, the cake was $ 30 by the way.</li><li>Last time when I dined at Trapper 's they were sold out of their Chocolate Truffle Cake- so this time, since my beloved Lemon Tart was not making an appearance- I opted for the said cake.</li><li>I felt that the top cream cheese layer was too heavy and that the cake lacked any real lemon flavour.</li><li>We both had the grilled fish which kept us going `` om nom nom'', but the cake was sadly dry and a great meal should always be highlighted by a yummy dessert ( IMO).</li><li>Not looking to return to this place anytime soon and definitely not for their cake.</li><li>This location is not as convenient as their other locations if you are driving but perfect if you are using public transit as it is close to North York Station. stopped in this place for some apps and cake and we ended up with stomach aches. the whole experience was a dissapointment. we had clamari which was rubbery and a small portion. i am a huge calamari fan and this dish was a huge dissapointment. i have had calamari at the brampton symposium many times and loved it everytime. we also had a pita bread pizza type bread with gouda and chicken. the gouda was shredded and sparring. the chicken lacked flavour and fell off the pita with each bite due to lack of cheese to meld it all together. the cheescake was ok. it was extremely soft, nearly a mouse texture and it lacked the delicious graham cracker bottom which is my fav part of cheesecake. the chocolate caramel cake was also a mousse like texture. the caramel was drizzled on top and was eaten in two bites by my 4 year old. the cake lacked any other caramel flavour. it was a large piece and most of it was left behind. i ordered a steamed milk to go with the cake and they forgot to serve it. one star is generous for this place. i would give it a zero if i could.</li><li>This location is not as convenient as their other locations if you are driving but perfect if you are using

bag.</li><li>They wiped our table off with a dirty cloth, leaving chunks of someone else 's cake behind.</li><li>Steaks are great, Ribs are great, and cake is great!</li><li>I chose an 8 `` cake and asked the lady if she could put'' Happy 35th Anniversary `` on it and so she wrote it on a white choco plaque.</li><li>I warned them all that it 's probably not what they 're expecting, but as soon as I saw their expressions taking a bite of their cake, I said it was ok to not swallow it and chuck it out, and every single person tossed their slice in the garbage with a sigh of relief.</li><li>The set menu comes with salad, soup, main and your choice of cake.</li><li>The extraordinary politeness and manner of the North York Maxim 's Cafe manage: `` Your cake wo n't be flipped ( by my staffs) unless it 's your car that flip over''.</li><li>They did n't have the cake.</li><li>So when my boyfriend showed up on Sunday to get the cake they did n't have it because she thought February 12th is Monday.</li><li>Definitely go there for the cake.</li><li>This place 's cake is a ABSOLUTE FAIL.</li><li>They have rum in the mix but they mix it so bad that you do n't even taste the layer of the cake.</li><li>I 'd suggest just taking out the cake.</li><li>The cake here is the best in the area.</li><li>This was my mistake but both the hot chocolate as well as the cake had a ridiculous amount of heavy cream and I could n't finish the cake because I felt like barfing.</li><li>It is the best cake ever- light, fluffy, and delicious.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
