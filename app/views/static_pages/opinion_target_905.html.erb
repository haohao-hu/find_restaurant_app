<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 905' %><h2>pho dau bo<br />occurrence: 4</h2><div><ol><li>The Scarborough location of pho dau bo is a joke, the soup does n't taste half as good and is full of MSG.</li><li>One of my favorite pho restaurants in the GTA, Pho Dau Bo is fast food without any of the drawbacks of typical fast food.</li><li>Ever since we were kids, if my folks were too lazy/pressed to make it on their own, or if we had Vietnamese guests, Pho Dau Bo is the one and only place they 'd eat at. ( this location is the finest within the GTA.)</li><li>The other places ( Pho Dau Bo, Pho Mi 99, etc) failed badly in this respect and I could clearly smell the shrimp paste in their soup.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
