<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 60' %><h2>wait<br />occurrence: 130</h2><div><ol><li>In this past year, I 've been there for 2 times. the most recent visit I took a few pictures, the sweet &amp; sour pork with the orange slices ( please see pictures) beside the S &amp; S pork, the 3 of us ordered the Kalbijim ( Beef Rib Stew) and the Kimchi fried rice. the banchan are good, wait, they are great.</li><li>You get some of those delicious dumplings, and thick yummy noodles, rice cakes ( tip: wait to eat them at the end so that they 've soaked up all that flavourful broth), mushrooms, veggies ...</li><li>Finally after 25minutes of wait ( reminder this is for lunch) with no tea or soup, I was able to place my order. somehow my waitress did not serve me tea-It 's something that comes with every Sushi restaurant so I didnt ask, after my sashimi got here with no tea, I could n't find my waitress again to ask her for it.</li><li>It is always busy but the wait is usually short.</li><li>It was the most uncomfortable wait ever.</li><li>You pretty much go up to the front, order your food, wait for your food, collect your food on a tray and go sit down at one of their tables.</li><li>The pizzas took a while to come out but were worth the wait.</li><li>It is a Small restaurant but definitely worth the wait.</li><li>I 've never experienced a long wait ( as Dan G. points out in his review) but I do agree the service is n't extraordinary.</li><li>There was a massive line up outside on the Sunday morning and the wait was well over 40 minutes but worth it!</li><li>It is well worth the long wait which just shows how popular it is and the menu is exquisite.</li><li>It was packed but the wait was short.</li><li>The wait time to get a table was probably around 10 minutes and the wait time for our food was about 10 minutes as well.</li><li>Well worth the wait which seems pretty non-existent once your asked what you want.</li><li>If you contemplate ordering in increments, then be prepared to wait and the wait sometimes is lengthy.</li><li>I was expecting that perhaps they would offer us the food for free or even discounted due to the long wait but nada.</li><li>I came again on a Friday night with a friend and the service was a bit slow, but they were quite packed and busy, which is always a good sign:) I ordered the golden dragon roll ( ?) and it took quite a while for it to come out, but aside from waiting, it was well worth the wait because it was amazingly delicious.</li><li>The wait was abit longer than I would expect to order but I suspect that these places it 's a given.</li><li>I 've been meaning to try this place for years now, but did n't have a chance to do until recently ... it was certainly not worth the prolonged wait.</li><li>However the truth is it is basically a regular waffle, with oreo pieces and chocolate ice cream. literally the opposite. the star they lost was due to extremely long wait time for the deserts, and also the waffles false advertisement. overall service and environment is nice, and the food was decent, so its worth a try, but probably not on a day right before a weekend perhaps.</li><li>The wait staff is quick to take your order, and to clear the table.</li><li>I urge you to restrain yourself from eating the whole basket because the `` main'' attractions are worth the wait.</li><li>The service was quite good and polite, but the wait was a bit long.</li><li>The wait time here could be quite long compared to other sharwama joints, where I waited around 15mins for my food.</li><li>After a long wait, a waitress came from the kitchen holding an empty garbage can and placing it under her desk.</li><li>And after she took it back another woman came to my table and asked me if I ordered tuna ( yes) then another 10 minute wait to fix it.</li><li>They seat you down after you wait in a awkward line and then they hand you the menus.</li><li>I did n't have to wait too long for my takeout.</li><li>BUT the pizza is honestly the best in Toronto. if you are patient do it. the pizza is from a brick stove fired by wood. for some reason its just awesome. worth the wait.</li><li>Came here on a Sunday night and surprisingly, we had to wait but the wait was quite short.</li><li>Expect a line that could reach the front entrance if you happen to come around that time, but it 's well worth the wait.</li><li>The wait can be rather long, and the service sub-par.</li><li>The service is really really slow, but should be expected since the ginseng chicken needs to be cooked by the waitress 3 times per table, including all other tasks they have to do ( they look really tired) I have been here a few times and all at bad timings because the restaurant is always full, each time the waitress tells us it 's a really long wait and they do n't know how long, in a tune that they want you to not wait and just leave.</li><li>Arrived at noon and was told a 1/2 hour wait for our table of 5.</li><li>It was super busy, but we did not have to wait too long for a table.</li><li>It gets busy even on weekdays so might be a wait ...</li><li>I rarely go to this part of town ( Bathurst &amp; Wilson) but I can see how people ( mostly Filipinos) do go out of their way and wait in line to eat here.</li><li>Wait time is a little longer for orders to come out but it 's certainly worth the wait.</li><li>No reason for such a long wait.</li><li>When she finally approached us, she said a huge crowd just came in, so the wait would be very very long.</li><li>And despite what other people have said, the wait was n't too long.</li><li>Compared to other stores ( Markham, Yonge and Finch, Downtown on Dundas, and the one right beside the Bata shoe museum on Bloor) with a similar queue of customers, this was a long wait.</li><li>I usually avoid most BBT places during prime time so I never have any issue with long wait or lines.</li><li>The waiter then told me: `` Do n't sit, wait here please'' at the cashier.</li><li>They do get fairly busy during their rushes but it 's worth the wait.</li><li>This place can reach full house quick and you tend to get trapped in between herds of students but the rain made way to a line-free 2 minute wait to bubbletea #1 50% sweet and less ice.</li><li>All the veggies were raw and the chicken was half-cooked so it took awhile for everything in the hotpot to to be fully cooked, but it was worth the wait!</li><li>There were so many different wait staff trying to console me, I felt like pulling out a whistle and waving a red card.</li><li>Our server was polite and helpful, although towards the end of our meal, her service levels fell ( empty water glasses, long wait for dessert menu and orders).</li><li>Oh wait, they did made us wait for 10 mins.</li><li>It worth the wait.</li><li>My coworker told me that the restaurant is not usually busy, but maybe because it was a Friday, we were not seated immediately ( the wait was only about five minutes).</li><li>We were not advised of any delays nor any acknowledgment of such a long wait.</li><li>SERVICE NOTES I got my sandwich to go and the wait was pretty much the exact amount of time I 'd like to wait for a sandwich.</li><li>There was only one server but the wait was n't long and the food was super fresh.</li><li>Well, the worst part is we made reservations and the young wait staff was like we do n't take reservations.</li><li>It 's worth the wait.</li><li>Definitely worth the wait, though.</li><li>This location is less crowded than the one in Thornhill, so you 'll have less of a wait, but it 'll still be at least 15 minutes for a table.</li><li>Beware that the line can be out the door on weekend nights from 6:30-8 PM, with a wait that can be up to half an hour.</li><li>However, there have been occasions where the wait was too long so my friends and I left.</li><li>By the time food comes ( not a very long wait at all) the ban chan has usually been devoured, but refills are never given unless yo flag them down and ask for it.</li><li>The wait can be awhile so I usually call ahead of time for takeout.</li><li>The restaurant is tight-spaced and pact however, the wait in line was decent and took about 10- 15 mins.</li><li>There is n't much of a wait time, the chefs make the sushi fairly fast even when there 's a huge line.</li><li>The wait outside would have suck, as it was pretty cold that night, but good thing we parked on Yonge right outside the restaurant, so we just waited in our car.</li><li>The wait times are pretty crazy during peak hours.</li><li>It is usually packed, so try to come on the off hours if you want to avoid the wait.</li><li>Not sure if it 's worth lining up for if the wait is going to be more than 20min ... especially in the winter.</li><li>I recommend going in during non-conventional hours or expect a long wait, which I think is really not worth waiting for.</li><li>Just go during non-busy times to avoid the wait.</li><li>But the pork was so juicy it was dripping on to my fingers and it was worth the wait.</li><li>A few examples of things that could be improved:- The wait at the front door is usually quite long considering the number of open tables.</li><li>Was served tea, new plates provided during meal, there was a slight wait for the peking duck but that was to be expected but the waiter also did advise that there will be a wait, so no big complaints.</li><li>The atmosphere can definitely use a face lift, but the duck is worth the wait!</li><li>But i was there for the food, so that didnt bother me much As for the wait, the lady told us there will be a $ 20min wait for the peking duck which was reasonable bcuz atleast you know they are serving you freshly roasted ducks.</li><li>Once you pay you sit down with your number and you wait to be served.</li><li>So finally after the long wait, all of our jajangmyuns start appearing before us.</li><li>The wait was n't too long.</li><li>It 's worth the wait!</li><li>This place is busy, but worth the wait!</li><li>The crepe took a bit long too and to be honest it was n't worth the wait.</li><li>Yes, their desserts are worth the wait.</li><li>The medium pho came first, but we waited a long time for the tendon pho and vermicelli ( a very very long wait, two tables that came after us got their food served before us.</li><li>Why did we have to wait to be seated when then were many empty seats and tables ???</li><li>If you 're looking for a place you can have a quick buffet meal, think of another place ... insulting me by making me wait to be seating in an empty restaurant is not usually what a buffet restaurant wants to happen ... usually be seated, served and leave is the way so they can turn over and seat more people.</li><li>We came on Mother 's Day and the wait was almost an hour.</li><li>After a short 10 minute wait I ordered the Eggs Natasha with salad.</li><li>The wait time for the food might be a bit longer than expected, but you can just use that time to bask in one of the better diner atmospheres in the city of Toronto.</li><li>However, it was worth the wait.</li><li>We did n't have to wait too long for our food either.</li><li>Overall, the service is fairly quick given how busy this place is ... and they are always very busy, so expect at least a 10 minute wait if dining on the weekend.</li><li>It has lots of seating, so the wait was n't bad ( 5 minutes for 4 people) for a Friday night.</li><li>The wait was about 10 mins, every table was full, and most of the guests were of Korean descent.</li><li>The wait for our food was ok.</li><li>If you are coming here, do n't get a private room and expect a wait for a refill of tea.</li><li>It was great and all, but the service was slow and not really worth the wait.</li><li>The wait between dishes took quite a bit longer than most AYCE buffets I 've been to.</li><li>The wait time is AMAZING.</li><li>This place is usually pretty full during peak time, but otherwise there wo n't be a wait.</li><li>We ordered their fried egg white puffs, they have sugar sprinkled on top and there is about a 10-20min wait for them.</li><li>Fortunately, we did n't have to wait too long to be seated and was able to eye what other tables were having for dinner.</li><li>There was a little bit of a wait, but not bad at all.</li><li>It 's usually busy, but worth the wait.</li><li>If you get there between 6.30-7.30pm- there is always a wait so be prepared to wait ... but well worth the wait and the line moves fast!</li><li>If you get there between 6.30-7.30pm- there is always a wait so be prepared to wait ... but well worth the wait and the line moves fast!</li><li>Terrible service and ridiculous long wait for food.</li><li>The wait times on Friday and weekend nights can be quite long, do n't expect to get immediate seating if you come during dinner time.</li><li>The only downside is how busy they are, and thus, how noisy it can get so sometimes the wait can be quite long.</li><li>Although the line ups were there the staff were able to keep the line moving and serve everyone efficiently, that the line seemed to be constantly moving forward and the wait was really not an issue and lasted no more than 10-12 minutes.</li><li>Very satisfying. satay on the road has been one of my family 's favorite restaurants since i was a kid. i remember coming here when i was ten and ordering the same thing that i get now, ten years later: cashew nut chicken with an order of steamed rice and the shrimp chips with peanut sauce. first of all, the food tastes delicious. i think there 's been one or two times out of the hundreds of visits to this place where the food tasted a little spicier than usual but other than that, it 's been consistently amazing for close to a decade. i 've had cashew nut chicken at other thai restaurants and it just does n't compare. i ca n't speak about most of their other food but from what i 've experienced they 've been by far the best tasting thai restaurant in and around toronto. the wait staff is quick and friendly for the most part which is great. the atmosphere of the restaurant is nice ... they just re-did it and although i have to say i prefer the original decor which had an authentic thai feel to it, their modern, contemporary approach to their new `` look'' is very pleasing to the eyes and enjoyable to dine at as well. the value of the food is great. my girlfriend and i come here for their lunch special almost every week at least once and have a full meal with a drink that leaves us satisfied for both taste and hunger for usually under $ 10, 15% tip included. how can you beat that ? really. not to mention, you can order shrimp chips and peanut sauce as an appetizer while you wait for your meal, at no charge. i have yet to find another thai restaurant in toronto that has that. five stars to my favorite thai place since i was ten. i was happy to see that they expanded and opened another store on bayview. good for them!</li><li>Then you have to find a seat, sit down and wait to be called.</li><li>If you do n't want to be irritated with the long wait and bad service I suggest not To go.</li><li>Great place for wings and beers, but the wait is definitely not worth it.</li><li>I do not understand why it is extremely busy here, always .. oh wait, I do, because it is a bar and it attracts the drunks; DUH!</li><li>The wait was 5 minutes and we sat down.</li><li>The wait extended to more than half hour.</li><li>But overall the food was worth the wait.</li><li>At any busy evening there are 30 chefs in the kitchen woking up seriously delicious Southern Chinese cuisines, there is never a long wait for food, and the consistency of quality is perhaps the reason why this location has thrived since inception.</li><li>I went here for lunch last week &amp; was annoyed cuz they made us wait for a table even though there were a few tables/booth avail!</li><li>Did n't see the usual wait staff who have always been nice.</li><li>The wait in line can be close to intolerable, so be prepared for it.</li><li>But well worth the wait!</li><li>It just seemed like EVERYONE knew this food was worth the wait !!!</li><li>We waited behind two people because the place was filled, however we did n't have to wait too long and we were seated at a comfy booth.</li><li>Always treated like family and service is fast and friendly But yes the place gets packed on the weekend, but it 's worth the wait.</li><li>Needless to say, the wait was long.</li><li>Thankfully the food was worth the wait.</li><li>It says that the wait is long and broth is bland.</li><li>Points off ( well, I 'm not actually taking points off, but downsides):- Limited seating- Sometimes the wait can be a bit long.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
