( Not sure what it is called but it was good) I plan on going again to try their lunch buffet! we ordered dinner for two when we stopped by. had bad experience with other buffet style indian food in the past- everything seems a lot more watered down. some of the stuff was good in the pre-fixe menu, some are kinda weird. i liked the tandori chicken and the lamb stew thing. grilled shrimp was mediocre. the long log of some sort of meat was not very good. naan was fresh and crispy so that was a plus. had some leftovers to take home for the next day even. food is alright, not fantastic.</li><li>Maybe I wanna do their lunch buffet!</li><li>I 've had their lunch buffet often, it 's reasonably priced and always fresh.</li><li>If Indian foods were low in calories, I 'd come here every other day for the lunch buffet.</li><li>I do want to try their lunch buffet.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
