<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 82' %><h2>meats<br />occurrence: 74</h2><div><ol><li>Not-so-great eats for me have been: spider roll ( the soft shell crab is panko breadcrumb crusted instead of tempura fried, I find it does n't taste as good), sukiyaki ( raw meats and noodles cooked in broth fondue style) and bibimbap ( korean stone bowl rice dish, which was done poorly).</li><li>Considering most places raise their prices every 8-12 months, I 'm impressed! 3) My biggest complaint with most Chinese food places is that you have to order each dish separately, so if a group of people want fried rice, noodles, and a few different meats, they 'd have to order about $ 40 worth of dishes and then divide it up themselves.</li><li>$ 5 for Three kinds of meats, rice or noodles, and soup.</li><li>Lastly, all the cooked meats were over cooked, and as somebody already mentioned the ribs were good.</li><li>They also had a variety of other dishes like bento boxes, chirashi lunches, and grilled meats.</li><li>I 've had their schwarma and kabab time special which comes with a assortment of meats and rice and salad and bread.</li><li>In the back they had a deli with fresh meats, fish and the largest pre cooked deli options I 've seen.</li><li>FOOD: Antipasto- Good amount of meats and cheese, but a tad pricey for what it is.</li><li>Assortments of chocolates, pantry items, sausages and meats, but check the dates as some items may have sat on the shelf for too long!</li><li>I am a huge fan of Shwarma, however I find their food to be a very low quality meats and not terribly tasty- it is definitely my least favorite Schwarma place that I have tried in all of the GTA.</li><li>The food though is really good as I shared: Charcuterie Board ( $ 14)- cured &amp; smoked meats, house made pâté, mustards, pickles, and bread While I nibbled off from my friend 's: Calamari ( $ 14)- lemon mustard aïoli, chilies and Shrimp Cocktail ( $ 16) Service was not the greatness this time .... our waitress was a little cold but I was too busy having a great time with my fellow yelpers to notice.</li><li>They need to add a meat plate option with 3 meats and a pile of rye.</li><li>The meats were grilled well but the common complaint here seems to be that the meats are on the dry side and I find myself agreeing.</li><li>The meats were grilled well but the common complaint here seems to be that the meats are on the dry side and I find myself agreeing.</li><li>Hidden in a sketchy looking strip mall, next to a sushi restaurant that 's also pretty fabulous, is this small mom-and-pop Italian grocery store that sells fresh cheese, bread, deli meats &amp; Italian desserts, in addition to a small selection of imported goods.</li><li>As for the food, the dipping appetizers were very tasty, but all the meats were dry, the tabuli rough and crunchy and the service was absolutely ABYSMAL.</li><li>What a shame: they have a great wood-fired oven and could use it to make awesome pizza and other meats or fish but alas ...... the pasta is okay.</li><li>First time have dinner there with my husband, we ordered a dinner for two which comes with wings &amp; rolls to start, then a combination plate with BBQ chicken &amp; pork, and we asked for upgrad a steam rich into garlic rich ..... the BBQ meats are very good condition, a man who looks very nice and I believed he is the owner of the restaurant told me they fresh cook the food by order, no msg ~ ~ that 's a good selling point.</li><li>A large is a satisfying serving of meats, tendon and noodles.</li><li>The chicken itself is as it sounds: boiled chicken, so the meats were moist and pretty good.</li><li>Sushi legend has a wide selection of fresh sashimi, high quality meats, and fast service.</li><li>Pancit Sampaguita is a noodle dish consisting of meats, thick noodle, and thin vermicelli noodle as well.</li><li>The garlic is not too overpowering, and it was a nice side dish to all of the main dishes)- Pancit Sampaguita ( great noodle dish because it had a lot of the meats, seafood and veggies- it was nice and moist [ not dry ])- Crispy Chicken with house sauce ( boneless chicken used with batter, not what I expected but still a good dish to order.</li><li>I had a quail egg ( tasted canned), a wonton ( lots of shrimp and pork filling, I wished there was more than just 1), a shrimp ( a good size, but not completely de-veined), 2 pieces of squid ( tasted rubbery), a piece of BBQ pork ( good flavour and not too fatty), 2 pieces of thinly sliced liver ( I do n't usually like liver, but this was ok), 2 pieces of thinly sliced heart ( I gave this to my dad because other than liver I do n't eat organ meats), and a fried fish ball sliced in two ( tasted good).</li><li>I find the food smelling of the meats and eggs that are being used in a not so good way.</li><li>Their fried rice is really good and I especially enjoy the Yeung Chow fried rice that comes with a variety of meats and vegetables.</li><li>The meats were overcooked and burnt.</li><li>Come here if you enjoy the taste of charred and chewy meats.</li><li>Price wise look for it to top out around $ 12 for the 10 pieces of Cevappi on a bun with the `` fixins'', one you start eating these, they are seasoned and I normally do n't like lamb, but because of the mix of meat I am unable to detect the lamb from the other meats, which can be a good thing, if you 're like me and do n't like how grassy Lamb tastes.</li><li>They also have a big selection of porky items: sausages, bacons, smoked meats, etc.</li><li>The chicken and beef shawarma wraps are both good on their own, although most of the time, anyone who gets a wrap goes `` mixed'' which is both meats -- but PLEASE remember to specify what you do n't want in it, or else it will have everything, including tahina, hot sauce, onions, etc -- and they generally do n't ask you.</li><li>All the meats, lamb, beef, chicken are very flavourful and tender.The rice and salad are very good as well.</li><li>The meats were so fresh, hot, toasty, tender, melt in your mouth delicious.</li><li>BBQ and roast meats are excellent.</li><li>Congee Queen has a huge menu and lots of delicious options to choose from that range from vegetarian, seafood &amp; fish to all sorts of meats!</li><li>This restaurant since it is Korean owned and run unlike the other two, its style is much closer to that of Korean restaurants, and for those who 've had it, will know the difference in korean bbq styles. the one thing bad at this place is although it is all you can eat, it does not provide lettuce with it, and you have to pay $ 2 extra for each plate of lettuce you want. which makes Chako more attractive to a lot of people. because Chako at a similar price points offer more variety. for this reason i think it depends what you want. this palce the meat is decent, but the variety is very litle it only has 6 different type of meats to order. however if you want an authentic korean experience for korean bbq.</li><li>The quality of the meats is good, and I would say better compared to other Korean BBQ 's that I have tried in Toronto.</li><li>The meats here are simple.</li><li>We tried all the meats.</li><li>BULGOGI house may not have as large of selection of meats ( only 6) however they are all distinct and have lots of flavor and marinated well.</li><li>They do n't offer any vegetarian dishes, as it may come in contact with their plethora of meats and fish, but their food is incredibly tasty.</li><li>The coleslaw and rice that came with the meats were okay.</li><li>You can get pasta, roast beef and other meats, pizzas.</li><li>The tofu is silky and is complimented by different meats, seafood and veggies.</li><li>Teriaki meats &amp; tempura are good, but the best thing here is the RICE; yes thats hard to believe, but their rice cooking is just incredible.</li><li>It was ok though, since the meats had good flavour to compliment it.</li><li>The wide variety of cold ( sliced) meats ( prosciutto crudo, prosciutto cotto, etc.) and cheeses are fresh and amazing to consume.</li><li>We ordered a bunch of appetizers and food for the table ( meats, cheese, pizza, potato, and roasted vegetables) there was a lot of food and it was just ok.</li><li>The rice dishes are yummy and filling and for around $ 7.50, you can get all three meats ~ I have n't tried any other dishes so far, but either way; it 's worth going here and not just because it 's close.</li><li>There are some hits ( mostly dough related) like chives and shrimp fried pancake, fried dumplings or thick noodle dishes, and the rest is just ok, with all the meats being covered by liters of thick and sticky sauce.</li><li>Even though the soup bowls we ordered are around $ 10 I did find some of the other dishes quite pricey, especially the bbq items, where one serving of raw meats are already above $ 10.</li><li>I highly recommend you order the babaganoush, as it compliments all the meats wonderfully.</li><li>Foodwise, the quality of the meats and vegetables were unmistakably top grade, and cooked well. p.s. you need to pay for parking, with a $ 2 discount off your bill when you provide the ticket stub.</li><li>We ordered their $ 44.99 sampler platter so we could try a variety of their meats.</li><li>The portions were ok- regular for a BBQ place with ribs and meats.</li><li>I 'm no expert on southern style food or smoked meats.</li><li>We had a platter known as `` around the world'' which gives you a sampling of all the meats on the menu.</li><li>The meats were cooked well, however i found the pieces of green peppers over cooked. overall this place is A-ok .... first time, and probably last time.</li><li>I enjoy the lamb, and I do recognize that all the meats are frozen ( what are you gonna do for a $ 12 lunch ?).</li><li>For those of you that do n't know, the way you eat at the Mongolian Grill is to fill an empty bowl with all sorts of raw meats, vegetables, sauces and spices and the cooks there will stir fry it before your very eyes.</li><li>Most of the meats and veggies were sliced, rather than in chunks.</li><li>I 'm almost certain that Genghis Khan did not conquer much of Central Asia and China by feeding his subjects a dizzying choose-your-own-adventure of meats, veggies, sauces and condiment sauces to be grilled on a giant stone lifesaver.</li><li>The novelty with the Mongolian Grill is that you are presented with a wide variety of raw meats ( beef, pork, chicken, and lamb) and vegetables, some seafoods ( shrimps, fake crab and squid rings), noodles ( egg, rice, udon, etc.) and a stupefying selection of soupy sauces ( spicy, curry, honey garlic ... more than 10 in total) and condiment sauces ( ginger, garlic, oyster ... more than 20 in total).</li><li>You pile it high in a bowl, from a choice of meats to a great variety of veggies, add sauce and/or seasonings and hand it over.</li><li>I have been here for lunch a few times with groups from work and I think they have something for everyone- seafood, veg, different meats, styles and spice.</li><li>Do n't know the name but their main thing is a build your own dish ( pick from a large assortment of veggies, meats and sauces give to chef who cooks it for you on this 6-8 for wide circular flat top stove) which is incredible ... and the food too.</li><li>I am one of many who love the Mongolian Grill concept, where you pick your own ingredients, meats or seafood, add tons of fresh veggies, plus noodles, sauces, and condiments, and hand your choices off to the chefs who will sizzle it up for you, on their 700 degree flat top.</li><li>This place has a great build your own stirfry section, from the meats, to the veggies, to the sauce and spices, everything!</li><li>Lots of meats, vegetables, noodles, and sauces.</li><li>The DIY stir fry section has a great variety of fresh meats, vegetables, and sauces.</li><li>There is 2 main buffet tables with stuff like rice, veggies, meats- your regular chinese buffet items.</li><li>My daughter will eat the Israeli meats- chicken or lamb on a skewer at any time of day.</li><li>The menu is quite extensive and offers all kinds of meats like Chicken, Beef, Lamb and even seafood platters.</li><li>I probably wo n't be back; something 's fishy here that does n't blend with my tastes ... i 'm not sure exactly what it is about this place that 's kept me coming back. i think it 's probably the ... ridiculously amazing subs they make! i 've been coming here for about 10 years now, and i think it 's possible that the submarines have gotten better since. seating is a bit limited, but as long as you do n't go during the rush hours, you should be fine. be prepared to wait 10 mins if it 's after last call and you 've got a craving. their bacon is just the right crispiness, their meats are fresh, fleshly diced lettuce, freshly sliced tomatoes and onions, homemade sub sauce, soft bread. mmmmmm i love that the walls are decorated with photos of loyal customers, some dating back to times when fashion meant a mullet: S they even have a pic with the stanley cup! this local spot has a following for a reason. if you love submarine sandwiches, you have to try one at belly busters. must gets are: anything with bacon `` lettuce, tomatoes, onions guys ?''</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
