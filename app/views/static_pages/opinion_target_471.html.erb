<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 471' %><h2>stone bowl<br />occurrence: 8</h2><div><ol><li>There was n't as many crunchy bits at the bottom of the stone bowl, however, probably one of the better bibimbaps I 've had in the GTA so far 3/5 Tip: do n't shy from using that big tub of salt on the table- you will have to season some dishes yourself ( ie: beef bone soup) Looking forward to coming back to try the other menu items.</li><li>The stone bowl was so hot for so long that the rice got really crusty and dry.</li><li>Apparently it 's like a dessert ... they pour water into the stone bowl, and it slowly cools as you eat your meal.</li><li>Flavorful soup, silky tofu, seafood, perfectly cooked rice, freshly cracked eggs half cooked in the soup, plus the water soaking the flavor of burned rice bottom on the stone bowl, it 's a perfect combination of flavors and texture.</li><li>Love the stone bowl and stirring like a mad man to work that egg into the rice.</li><li>Second flaw was that my ideal image of soon tofu is when they rush it over to your table, the soup is hot and bubbling over the stone bowl.</li><li>The bibimbap comes out in a sizzling stone bowl with a variety of sauteed vegetables on top of sticky rice.</li><li>You crack your own egg in ( it 's all part of the interactive fun) and you get noorungjee from your stone bowl after ( toasted rice cookie).</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
