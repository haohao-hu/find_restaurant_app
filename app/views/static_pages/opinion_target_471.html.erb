<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 471' %><h2>nachos<br />occurrence: 8</h2><div><ol><li>Wings were very big and delicious but nachos was horrible.</li><li>Complimentary nachos were a nice addition and the server was also friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.</li><li>The nachos had grilled chicken chunks on them- added a nice grilled flavour to the nachos.</li><li>The nachos were edible, but for a platter, they seemed mighty medium sized!</li><li>On the positive side, the Korean BBQ beef coleslaw sandwich and fries were really delicious ... i did n't even need to use their special garlic dill dip but i recommend ordering the dip with your fries to have a fresh change from ketchup sometimes. today 's soup was beef barley which was average as was the double amaretto sour however i was pleased they offered fresh options and could accommodate my off-menu drink request. final tip- do not order the nachos here. they were pretty bad ... happy i can always get great nachos at my joint fox n fiddle finch. hope the manager can fix the crappy service here because I 'd like to come back to watch a game and taste the fajita tacos, fish tacos or one of their tempting burgers. ok last last tip i dont know if i should write this but the servers are pretty so i guess that could be a plus for those who appreciate that sort of thing.</li><li>The nachos.</li><li>The nachos were obviously put together with little thought and was doused with the cheese sauce with some shredded cheese on top to cover it.</li><li>The nachos were terrible ( barely any toppings) and the Caesar salad was meh ...</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
