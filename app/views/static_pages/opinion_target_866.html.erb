<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 866' %><h2>service staff<br />occurrence: 5</h2><div><ol><li>I have visited the place more than 50 times and I keep wondering how they manage to always keep around the most professional of service staff, I took 4 of my office associates out for lunch and we each ordered a drink, an appetizer and a main course, waitress serving us memorized each of our orders without writing it down, while some upscale places have up to 3 people serving a table of five and would still manage to misplace or confuse an item or two per order.</li><li>Good quality and good price and they are really on-time. definite a must go place if you 're looking for japanese/korean food in the area. very friendly service staff .... ambiance is great. more importantly, food is amazing at least compared to the other japanese restaurant within the neighborhood. tempura is a must have.</li><li>All-in-all, I enjoyed my experience at Sushi Legend and the service staff were efficient and attentive.</li><li>SERVICE: Generally, the service staff are friendly and polite but they could be easily swamped when the restaurant gets too busy and then, become inattentive.</li><li>Limited English with some service staff.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
