veal was better to my bias.</li><li>My brother especially enjoyed the bone marrow from the veal.</li><li>Those who ordered veal at the table were also very pleased with their selection.</li><li>Veal Piccata- $ 18.95 My friend 's entree was not much of a looker, but he enjoyed the tenderness of the veal.</li><li>Veal was really flavourful and every ingredients goes together well in the bowl.</li><li>The bibimbap was quite good as well; it came with an assortment of vegetables, raw veal and a raw egg on top allowing you to cook said egg and veal to your liking in the hot stone pot.</li><li>The bibimbap was quite good as well; it came with an assortment of vegetables, raw veal and a raw egg on top allowing you to cook said egg and veal to your liking in the hot stone pot.</li><li>The veal was served in a spicy sauce that had a big kick; they did serve hot sauce on the side which I added prior to tasting the dish and realized that it was unnecessary as the dish on its own would probably have been sufficiently spicy.</li><li>The hot sauce is yummy with the raw veal.</li><li>But the veal itself was just okay; there was n't much taste to it besides the gochujang.</li><li>And because its minced, the veal becomes non-existent when everything mix together.</li><li>I tried the ginseng chicken soup, the bibimbap with the raw veal, the kimchi fried rice with hotstone and a few things which I could n't remember.</li><li>Otherwise the veal was very tender.</li><li>Bibimbap was well done, stone bowl hot enough to make the rice crunchy, veal was just ok.</li><li>The bibimbap had raw veal and mushrooms with all the other typically bibimbap ingredients.</li><li>It also comes with a soup ( more like a broth) which I found came in quite handy to cut the spiciness from the veal!</li><li>But the veal was tasty.</li><li>The lasagna was decent but certainly did n't shine compared to the veal.</li><li>The pizzas beat any pizza place in the city, the parms ( eggplant, chicken or veal) are the best in the city and the sandwiches are hearty, filling and so good as well!</li><li>My friends had the salmon and the veal ... in their words the best food they have had.</li><li>She had an eggplant sandwich and I had a veal pasta, since the sign out front says they have the best veal in town.</li><li>We order at the counter with the friendliest man in the world, who puts together her sandwich, then goes to the kitchen to make my veal.</li><li>The veal was okay, but I think that I might not be a big fan of veal, since I 've had it a few times and have yet to be blown away by it, even at trusted tasty places.</li><li>The veal was okay, but I think that I might not be a big fan of veal, since I 've had it a few times and have yet to be blown away by it, even at trusted tasty places.</li><li>The beef sausages I had was bit salty and the veal my partner had too greasy ..</li><li>Would recommend anyone to give the best veal in town a try.</li><li>Best Veal in town!: hell yea! tenderized, and full of flavor, not excessively breaded, not chewy, just perfecto! served with the al-dente spaghetti and marinara! que belissima! 4.5/5 Tartufo! 4/5 chocolata served with whipped cream, and crackers ..... great way to end off the dessert.</li><li>It was tender, and juicy- not at all over-cooked, which often happens with veal.</li><li>Called had a pleasant conversation and ordered a large pizza with pepperoni, bacon, Italian sausage and extra cheese, and a veal parmesan with hot peppers and mushrooms on a bun.</li><li>But it was perfectly baked, the veal was tender and flavorful.</li><li>I dropped in today for lunch and had a good veal parmigiana sandwich and a drink for $ 8.50 taxes in .... the veal was hot, the bun was fresh, the mozzarella cheese was plentiful and stringy ... mushrooms and peppers were good but could have used a few more to make it perfect.</li><li>Pasta and the vegetable with my veal were salty and my veal was a little dry for the medium rare that I requested.</li><li>Pasta and the vegetable with my veal were salty and my veal was a little dry for the medium rare that I

and do n't forget the cheese, lots and lots of cheese on the veal !!!</li><li>The best part is, its in walking distance to me, so when I have a craving for some nice veal, I do n't have to go hinting around the city as it seems to be hard to find!</li><li>If you 're coming here to grab a hot meal- you should be here for the Cevappi, which are a ground meat sausages made with veal, lamb and pork.</li><li>The veal was tender and thinly cut.</li><li>I could hardly finish the sandwich, Bun was soft and veal was nice and tender.</li><li>My coworkers all got veal sandwiches, I have never had veal, but I 'll take their word that it was good.</li><li>This is a great place to get an Italian sandwich: meatball, veal or chicken- spicy, saucy, and huge.</li><li>Oh, and I 've only had the veal, but I bet it 's all good.</li><li>So many super thin pieces of tender veal in the sand which really worth the price.</li><li>Keep but definitely recommend the veal.</li><li>The veal was lacking flavour and not very good.</li><li>The owner, lively and tank topped took great care of us and even gave us a free meatball sandwich after mistakingly giving us an extra veal ( not the worst mistake one could endure).</li><li>People dig the pizza but I only go for the veal.</li><li>This is a great sandwich for $ 6.99, you could add extra toppings but I chose not to this time to taste the veal.</li><li>I recommend getting the veal with cheese and mushrooms.</li><li>Friends tried their chicken, sausage and steak, but I believe veal is the best choice here.</li><li>When you bite into the tender veal with the combination of the sauce and fresh bread and sweated onions, it 's amazing.</li><li>The veal here is really good.</li><li>Delicious italian sandwiches -- breaded veal on a soft bun with tomato sauce.</li><li>I love me my veal.</li><li>The sandwiches still taste good but are expensive and the veal is hammered paper thin.</li><li>Ordered the veal w/ cheese and mild sauce ...</li><li>The texture of the slightly crusty exterior and soft interior of the bun, along with the 2-3 layers of thin, but crispy veal, the melted cheese, and the sauce comes together to create a sandwich that is layered to perfection.</li><li>You get what you pay for- veal was cooked decently, there was just nothing crazy special about it.</li><li>The veal sandwich was two thin slices of breaded veal drenched in sauce and served on a kaiser roll.</li><li>The veal overlaps across each other and extend outward from the sandwich.</li><li>You 'll get some flaps of breaded veal hanging from the end of the bun.</li><li>I 've been back since and have tried the veal, chicken and meatball.</li><li>Excellent quality meat kabobs such as chicken, veal, beef.</li><li>The barg was very
