<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 970' %><h2>ambient<br />occurrence: 4</h2><div><ol><li>This is something they could consider adding, but given the ambient volume of the place ( hip hop top 40 music filled with loud chatter of other patrons) and the small line up in the waiting area, I think they 're doing just fine without it.</li><li>The place was n't bad I did find the Korean food more bland than other places I go too.their ambient is casual and it looks clean.</li><li>Service is fast and attentive and I absolutely love hearing the Vietnamese ambient music as I slurp on a perfect steaming hot bowl of Pho Dac Biet.</li><li>While the food itself was adequate ( I ordered a regular pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms and green peppers), my overall satisfaction with the restaurant was significantly negatively affected by the high levels of ambient noise.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
