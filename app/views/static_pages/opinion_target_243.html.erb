<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 243' %><h2>beef ribs<br />occurrence: 18</h2><div><ol><li>Removed a lot of key items like beef ribs.</li><li>The beef ribs were tender and tasty.</li><li>I 've ordered the Kalbi here before ( beef ribs) and they 've been tender and marinated the way you would expect it.</li><li>I enjoyed the steam egg and their beef ribs are quite good, however, we had to eat through conversations between the servers in Mandarin about how this one table is still ordering and complained about them openly.</li><li>Also the beef ribs were tasty but it had a lot of fat on it and very little meat therefore im eating 20% meat and 80% fat ..</li><li>The quality of the beef ribs were n't any good.</li><li>Be sure to get the beef ribs and volcano roll.</li><li>Some things i get every single time- green dragon roll ( fav), beef ribs ( greasy and fatty but SO good), tempura ( the batter is not too heavy and is just right), grilled squid, beef/pork enoki rolls ( these are amazing), grilled eggplant ( if you love eggplant you will love this), teppanyaki veggies ( it 's basically cooked in butter) A must try if you 're into AYCE.</li><li>We had quite a variety- sushi, sashimi, tempura, beef ribs and enoki mushrooms wrapped in beef.</li><li>On to the BBQ, we had bulgogi ( marinated beef), kalbi ( beef ribs), marinated chicken, and pork stomach ( bacon).</li><li>But I like the beef ribs at Chingu more than here.</li><li>I still love their side dishes, the cold noodle with beef ribs.</li><li>Today I tried their beef ribs bento box special for $ 10.</li><li>It comes with beef ribs, rice, spicy salmon roll, miso soup, and green salad.</li><li>ALL of these things were listed on the menu ... they also seem very stinge with everything. servings are small ... which could be a good thing ... i ordered beef sashimi .. that must be the most horrifying color i have ever seen ... it looked like rotting corpse from the walking dead color. just looked wrong .. please see pics. ordered the beef ribs ... it came out jet black burnt ... see pic. why would you bother serving it ? it makes no sense. the dude left a paper on our table and did not take the order, so i brought it to the front since i was going to the washroom ... he then gives me a lecture saying dont give orders to the front desk. i wouldnt have to if your service was better. water was never filled once. the only reason this place gets 2 star is because they had red tuna as a sashimi choice. which btw came out two different colors .. one time it was red .. the second time i ordered it was light pink ... i suspect they gave me F grade fish the second time around.</li><li>Meat is very similar in quality as all the other korean placea in gta but the broth is a little more tasty LA beef ribs.</li><li>The main course was beef ribs, nicely done as well, good sides- mashed potatoes and veggies.</li><li>The beef ribs had 3 1/2 bones ( 1/2 because one of them was really small and had next to no meat) and it had more fat than I would have liked ( and less meat), but it was marinated really well.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
