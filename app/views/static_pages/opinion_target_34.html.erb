<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 34' %><h2>manager<br />occurrence: 203</h2><div><ol><li>She complained to the manager as well and was told the same thing.</li><li>I have been at this place for past few days and simply its the worst experience. the first day I got my gyro order on toasted white bread with no sauce or any other form of toppings !! when I complained to server and ask if I coukd see the manager `` I was told that there is no manager at this place and the owner is running the place'' AND OF COURSE THE OWNER WAS NOT AROUND. on second visit I ordered the bruschetta dish, no basil or olive oil was used !!!!</li><li>It ended up having one flavor of wings, claiming it was the best kind there is: -S A man who looked like the manager was taking care of the venue in every way he could, and he was overall pretty helpful.</li><li>It came with one little piece of lemon wedge and the guy who looked like the manager offered to bring me more, which was nice.</li><li>When I went with friends we got lots and lots of food, and the manager even gave us an extra complimentary dish.</li><li>They passed the buffet and he asked either the manager or a server if he could take a piece of banana bread to settle her.</li><li>When we called back to inform them of this blunder the manager at the time was quite apologetic and offered to comp one of the entrees for next time.</li><li>The manager suddenly offered to cover an entrée if we came tonight.</li><li>The manager is a real piece of work ( balding, older Asian guy).</li><li>Was about to tip but then the head server or manager she came into our face to tell us we needed to tip her like chill the hell out.</li><li>The manager said that the fine print applied to both promotions even tho there was n't an asterisk on the `` Free Dinner''.</li><li>Since we had 6 people, 2 of us could still have used the 10% grand opening promotion but the manager said we MUST sit separately.</li><li>I ca n't believe the manager treated us this way when it was n't our fault.</li><li>Needless to say, the manager basically called us stupid when we questioned why she charged us twice for something we ordered one of.</li><li>I still have the receipt and bill saved to verify the date/time my colleague and I were present, and I am more than willing to sit down with the manager and owner of this sub-par restaurant.</li><li>I wonder if its the manager 's attitude that keeps the place empty !!</li><li>Joe the manager is great and makes sure everything is up to par.</li><li>And the manager was always walking around, keeping a watchful eye.</li><li>All the servers and store manager try their best to accommodate you.</li><li>The manager and owner both came to greet our table and brought over complimentary appetizers and side dishes.</li><li>The front manager took my order.</li><li>The manager recognized us when we walked in.</li><li>I liked that the manager is nice enough to greet you as you enter and wish you well as you depart.</li><li>Staff are courteous and friendly and the manager will often come around to ensure customers are getting whatever they need.</li><li>We did tell our server and got a visit from the manager, He was rude and did not look very anderstanding.</li><li>`` It 's the light,'' the manager said.</li><li>Do n't direct complaints to the manager because he 's a idiot.</li><li>You 're now being unhelpful and I 'm having uncomfortable thoughts, like `` the manager must be really desperate if they 're hiring people who do n't actually work and wo n't help me exchange money for food''.</li><li>After some negotiating, manager finally agreed not to charge us for the food we had n't received and had n't eaten.</li><li>Soon he 's standing at my table, the manager is standing at my table and I 'm feeling like I just broke out of prison and stole a hot card.</li><li>Our server, who said she was a manager, was perfect: friendly, efficient, and she made great suggestions.</li><li>The manager is sexist however the waitress Sara was very polite and kept apologizing as if it was her fault the food we got was cold ..</li><li>This was after the manager confronted the hostess about an issue in front of us before seating us.</li><li>I do n't understand how their manager is fine with this !!</li><li>This is the manager of the place.</li><li>I thought service was ok. disgusting. absolute shit. it taste horrible and the amount of rice they put on sushi to make you full faster ... and how thin their sashimi is ... oh did i mention that its overpriced ? the waitress is an asshole with attitude ... the manager is an asshole with attitude. horrible service. you have to pay extra for parking as well ... they wont validate it for more than an hour even though they take forever to make their food. i swear they do that on purpose ... fucking ridiculous.</li><li>Had to speak to the manager and they did allow it but the server wasnt aware.</li><li>We asked to speak to the manager and were first lied to that he was n't there, when in fact, he was.</li><li>However, the Saturday morning manager was terrible!</li><li>The manager however was belligerent and hostile.</li><li>The manager should have been polite, he should have apologized for the mistake made by whoever took the telephone reservation, and he should have offered a complimentary coffee!</li><li>( Apparently the manager whispered to the poor hostess: Why did n't you lock the door, when our party walked in.</li><li>They acknowledged that it tasted awful but did not agree to my request to replace it although i had only one bite! asked me to dump the dish in the garbage and try next time. no money was refunded in the absence of the `` manager''.</li><li>When my parents and I left, the manager, who was sitting down having food himself, thanked us for dropping by.</li><li>The manager at this location got in touch with me and apologized for this mishap.</li><li>I asked for a manager and the lady said `` there 's no manager here right now I will call you back in a minute'' and hung up.</li><li>No manager at sight or site ( as said), and we left hungry and unserviced!</li><li>The manager offered us a free appie card for our next visit and he took 15% off the bill.</li><li>The manager made no effort to appease us.</li><li>The manager or owner of this restaurant was really sweet because she tries her best to make sure we are satisfied.</li><li>She said she ca n't do anything about this since the manager is not around and she also claimed if she gives me a compensation the tilt will go short and she had to pay out of her pocket ?! damn right you should!</li><li>The manager is just as arrogant as the last time, doubt things will change here.</li><li>Our waitress barely spoke english and did n't really know the menu, the manager who came to explain was a bit under dressed like she was heading to a new years party in Phuket.</li><li>The manager seemed to be oblivious to what was going on.</li><li>Finally I got up and asked the manager why our drinks were not served yet.</li><li>We told our server that we did n't want this and she brought it back and the manager said he would refund the purchase after our meal.</li><li>I had ordered a tabbouleh salad with a side of chicken skewers and when the server brought our food I was served a fattoush salad with the chicken so I told her that it was n't what I had ordered and she brought it back to her manager who seemed confused then a few minutes later she came back with my food.</li><li>The manager never once came up to us to apologize for his mistakes or see if everything had been resolved.</li><li>When we had finished our sub par meals my friend then had to go find the manager in order to get a refund on the hummus we were charged for that we did n't even want and he was n't even the person that refunded the money it was the girl who was the server.</li><li>We finally placed our order to a clearly harried and very gruff waiter, who appeared to be the manager.</li><li>Gerald Milgrom, the catering manager, is an extremely difficult person to work with.</li><li>The manager came over to apologize and he said he would give us 50% off.</li><li>The manager offered us a 10% discount which is a joke and I kindly commented on how we are still midway on our lunch.</li><li>The service here sucks big time UNLESS you get the lady manager or the guy manager they are both very polite and very caring about the customer service but the actual servers do n't care at all.</li><li>The manager or supervisor there is always friendly.</li><li>Scrumptious food, nice manager, cute children, free wifi, food comes with drinks during lunch, lots of outlets to charge tablets and phones, very considerate restaurant!</li><li>When we requested to speak with a manager, the waitress returned and said he must have stepped out because they ran out of something.</li><li>He went to bring over the manager.</li><li>What came next was probably the worst manager interaction I 've ever experienced.</li><li>The manager then told us that if we did n't need anything else, that he would get our bill and asked if we were paying by card, basically ushering us out.</li><li>After another 20 minutes of waiting patiently, the manager came to our table to tell us to move seats so another customer could squeeze into the already tight space.</li><li>The manager refuses to give you any form of compensation and if they do its a `` favour'' do n't expect it ever again.</li><li>Oh and I 've never seen the manager because they are never there to resolve the issue instead relay the message over the phone.</li><li>It 's embarrassing and the manager must not care about his business if he hires people like that.</li><li>I asked if it was the special and the lady turned to the manager and the manager told me no, it 's not the special.</li><li>I asked if it was the special and the lady turned to the manager and the manager told me no, it 's not the special.</li><li>The manager Kai, messed up my order ( do n't know how many messed up orders he did beforehand, causing a long line) he can not tell the difference between the different jellies.</li><li>The service counter was kind of abrupt too, especially considering we were being helped by the assistant manager, so I was kind of expecting a bit more in the customer service area.</li><li>The waitress readily changed the order but the manager came by and and gave her rude and confrontational two cents about the matter.</li><li>When we complained about our disappointment and asked for another option the manager explained that because there was n't anything wrong with the food it could n't be changed.</li><li>The manager was a lot nicer and offered to exchange it for a better dish, the curry chicken.</li><li>The manager did n't even try and talk to us about what happened which I thought was ridiculous.</li><li>And we knew it was time to retire for the night when the manager shut off all of the lights in the restaurant.</li><li>So after your breakdown in performance, I spoke with the manager.</li><li>Brought up Jacky 's issues and behaviour with her manager, who offered NO APOLOGY but instead muttered to me, `` thank you for my feedback''.</li><li>Overall I am SHOCKED and have never been so FLABBERGASTED by the ridiculousness of the situation and the lack of service I received from both immature and poorly-trained Jacky as well as her incompetent manager counterpart.</li><li>The manager did not make an effort what-so-ever to try to mitigate the issue or try to find out what was wrong with the service.</li><li>The original server looked confused and was still talking to the manager, she did n't seem to care that she left me with no coat to begin with.</li><li>Our server was great and went to double check with the manager regarding food ingredients, as my mother has food allergies.</li><li>Lastly- and the last straw for us: I only ate half of my ( $ 18!) pad Thai and asked for the other half to go, the manager ( a man with a nice purple dress shirt and tie) ended up tossing it out !!</li><li>If you ever experience a problem, the manager ( and often the owner Linda herself) is right there, and they will go out of their way to correct it for you with a smile.</li><li>We end up going with a Pinot as they didnt have what we wanted, 10 minutes later, she comes over to take our food order .... starter ..... spring rolls .... easy enough right .... not for this server .... she forgets to put the order in and about 30 minutes later we have our main course ..... i order Chicken Panang ( $ 17 ..... way to expensive for what it was) and my wife some vegetable hot pot with tofu skin and mushroom in it ( $ 17 ... way to expensive for what it was) I spoke to the manager/ owner of this location.</li><li>The manager came by to tell us because of a printing problem and that is why our remaining items were delayed, but he arranged it so that we 'd get our entree soon and the dessert would be to go.</li><li>A good friend of mine from Israel used to be a manager there about 10 years ago.</li><li>The staff and I think the manager looked at me, and began to ask each other questions.</li><li>Perhaps hire a manager who is out of highschool ?</li><li>The cantonese speaking manager is quite rude.</li><li>The manager was so kind and always kept an eye on our table to make sure we were doing fine.</li><li>I presume he was the manager who likely is the owner or is his son as he had this air of entitlement to him.</li><li>So I did n't try to argue as there are other ones still open, but I did want to speak to the manager to let them know of the inconsistent information.</li><li>The waitress said the manager was on the phone so it 'll be a few minutes.</li><li>I was shocked, I felt so disrespected that throwing garbage was more important than a customer sitting waiting to speak to a manager.</li><li>I got up to tell the manager and, with him being rude and not taking it back, decides to start shouting at me and threaten to call the cops.</li><li>After paying I did speak to the manager.</li><li>I' be gotten a chance to talk to the manager and he 's such a good person.</li><li>And what good is a manager coming over to speak to me when I 've been waiting more than half an hour for my dinner ?!</li><li>Reservation does n't seem to be taken seriously as the manager seem to prioritize her friends who did not make reservations.</li><li>The manager was just soo busy talking and taking care of her friends.</li><li>Waiter and this tiny little short girl who is the manager say they cannot redeem me the full value of my groupon because my kids are not adults and thus we are not a group of 4 !!!!</li><li>Tiny little short girl manager says i can give you what you paid for your groupon and redeems 36.50 on my final bill after taxes.</li><li>Seems like the young waiter that was in the old place is now a manager here.</li><li>We wo n't make that mistake again the manager was friendly about taking it back no problem.</li><li>Very very disappointed I have to say, the food was not fresh, the beef was almost a blackish color and tasted sour, when I pointed out to the waitrese and the manager, they said that 's the way it should be.</li><li>The server canme back with a Siracha in her hand and apologized stating the manager refused to give us the spicy sauce .... poor customer service in Asian restaurants are expected.</li><li>This place serves quantity sushi for a very reasonable price although whenever i go there, I always see the cashier being abused by the manager.</li><li>Another family actually went into the kitchen to speak to the manager so they could get seated.</li><li>Terrible manager.</li><li>Antonio, as a manager you should apologize for your staff not being prompt with service.</li><li>There was some guy who looked like a manager walking around and chatting with people.</li><li>Even with an apology from the manager and a discount on the bill.</li><li>I also asked the manager to look into the spoiled food issue and he said ok.</li><li>I had to to go back and return it amd request that the manager smell the salad.</li><li>Disgusting customer service from both the manager at the restaurant, as well as from head office.</li><li>The restaurant manager sends a condescending insulting so called apology email, and head office sends a disgustingly insulting `` form letter'' not even addressing the original complaints over a month after the initial complaint was put in.</li><li>It 's obvious to see no one cares about the customer when the `` manager stands around talking and chit chatting as well as staff when people are waiting to be seated.</li><li>The manager was the sweetest lady too- when I asked to swap out the olives, she allowed me to sub it with other veggie.</li><li>I ended up calling the store and spoke with the manager.</li><li>As the owner or even manager he undoubtedly knows the menu says all sandwiches come with fries, roasted potatoes or rice, which I pointed out to him.</li><li>When I called and spoke with the manager he says oh ya that sometimes happens with our veggie pizza, can I do anything for u, I was like can u send me another one and with annoyed voice he goes ok but please return the pizza to the driver, I said sure ( as if I was gonna eat that trash).</li><li>Anways the manager was there and he quickly apologized.</li><li>The manager said that this rarely happens and if it does happen they go over and beyond to make it right.</li><li>The 2 stars are for the poor service ( Update November 2016: upgraded to 3 star due to last time being quite good, the manager made sure we were making it for our movie!).</li><li>This random server girl brought us our bill early while my guests were still eating, the manager ( woman in blazer) came to our table to apologize.</li><li>When you go to this place seems that the house Speciality is Hair in your food, also the manager says !!</li><li>They got my order wrong and when I went to complain, the manager did n't fix the situation but instead told me that I was in the wrong.</li><li>Friendly manager.</li><li>The manager was disinterested and I have to say my dining experience from here was nothing more than fine.</li><li>My girlfriend continuously tried to flag servers who would n't come to our table, then one who appeared to be a manager still with no response.</li><li>I asked to speak to a manager.</li><li>She walks over to the manager and he comes over to speak to me.</li><li>I call and ask to speak to the manager ( Dominic) and explain to him what happened yesterday and said I was calling to see if the cake was ready and if my Mother 's name was now spelled correctly.</li><li>We asked to talk to a manager and waited and waited.</li><li>I complained online only to receive a call from the manager saying that he had never received such a complaint before so it was n't his fault.</li><li>We were there for an hour and in that hour we got interrupted by the waiter and manager 16 times.</li><li>I 'm not going to make a scene, quietly flagged down the manager and told him the issue, took it back and it took 25 mins for a new salad to come back ... we asked once in the number of interruptions we got if the salad was ever going to come and we just got brushed off.</li><li>Overall a great experience. i was sooo offended. as the manager of a bar, i understand some things take time, but being rudely greeted by the bar staff and ignored for 10 minutes while they do nothing is pretty bad to begin. having the barstaff whispering to each other while blatantly pointing at my friend is obscene. we asked to move to a table. they said fine, no one brought us menus or asked us if we wanted drinks. the bitchy blond bartender walked right by the table 4 times, making a point of not looking at us and cleaning tables right next to ours, yet still ignoring us. then she walked to the edge of the bar and twirled her hair for a bit, all the while making sure not to make eye contact with us. we finally went over to the bar and asked the guy if we could get menus or drinks or service, explaining to him that we have been waiting for ten minutes, when he rudely informed me that i had only been waiting 20 seconds. so i asked for the bill from our drink at the bar, had my tip rudely returned to me, amid more whispering and pointing at us. im disgusted and quite upset about being treated like that, especially because i used to be quite a regular there, and im a big tipper and very polite ( dont forget i manage a bar, and it should be all about customer service). i wouldnt recomend this place to anybody for any reason. maybe a different location, not this one.</li><li>She turned to her manager who was standing adjacent to her, asked if it was cool if they waived it and he nodded and the waitress said it was okay that we sit.</li><li>Waitress #2 kept asking me if I was sure that the manager said he would waive our cover and I kept saying yes yes yes.</li><li>At this point, waitress #3 came to us and explained how there was nothing they could do about the cover and that there was nothing the manager could do.</li><li>She acknowledged that and continued to say that none of the servers nor the manager could do anything about it.</li><li>Waitress #3 returns to tell us that no one in the restaurant can do anything about our situation including the manager.</li><li>Whom I assume to be the manager due to his attire, was the one in which seated us at a comfy booth, he did not say one word on the way to the table ( simply doing the two finger peace sign to check that it was just us two dining for the afternoon as we arrived at the front door).</li><li>We complained about the service to the `` manager'', a weird looking guy came.</li><li>On the positive side, the Korean BBQ beef coleslaw sandwich and fries were really delicious ... i did n't even need to use their special garlic dill dip but i recommend ordering the dip with your fries to have a fresh change from ketchup sometimes. today 's soup was beef barley which was average as was the double amaretto sour however i was pleased they offered fresh options and could accommodate my off-menu drink request. final tip- do not order the nachos here. they were pretty bad ... happy i can always get great nachos at my joint fox n fiddle finch. hope the manager can fix the crappy service here because I 'd like to come back to watch a game and taste the fajita tacos, fish tacos or one of their tempting burgers. ok last last tip i dont know if i should write this but the servers are pretty so i guess that could be a plus for those who appreciate that sort of thing.</li><li>The manager insulted a group of people for not having space for them!</li><li>And the worst part was the manager showed finger to the eldest person of the group !!!!</li><li>I hope the manager teaches him how to treat lady customers in the future.</li><li>Manager is so friendly, helpful, and smiley.</li><li>The manager, well there was no manager he/she was not even present or at least made themselves as absent as could be! and the kitchen manager refused to exit to come out and speak to me in person.</li><li>The manager, well there was no manager he/she was not even present or at least made themselves as absent as could be! and the kitchen manager refused to exit to come out and speak to me in person.</li><li>Rude and unprofessional manager.</li><li>The restaurant has amazing staff, but a rude and careless manager.</li><li>I asked her why its like that, the manager told me that how we serve the potato !!!!</li><li>The first person to greet us, and I believe it was the manager, welcomed us and pointed for us to sit in a booth.</li><li>When she finally did, the manager made a BS excuse that their computer sometimes does not work specifically for that table.</li><li>TL; DR:- waited 30 minutes for food that never came- had to ask for menus, tea, and side dishes on three separate occasions- rude and passive aggressive waitress who said, and I quote, `` what do you need ?''- incompetent manager who made poor excuses rather than admitting mistakes- turned a loyal customer into an frustrated Yelp reviewer in one night.</li><li>Fantastic food cool place excellent manager `` Pending review As some of you already know, form following my posts, my wife and I are world travelers and foodies.</li><li>Basically it was the taste the décor and the manager making sure we were happy and satisfied with our experience, which we were.</li><li>I have certain food allergies and the manager was terrific in firstly checking all ingredients for me and then following up with us personally ensuring that our order was done right ..</li><li>Manager was polite &amp; refunded our money.</li><li>Salmon sushi pizza Salmon sushi hand roll Salmon sushi $ 38.40 Rice tasted weird Sushi had a stale after taste Drowned my salmon sushi in soya sauce and it still did n't help get rid of the awful aftertaste They charge you extra for fish eggs ( The girl kept telling me it was 5 cents extra and they charged me $ 2.50 When I spoke to the manager he said it was 50 cents extra per order) The girl taking my order could n't spell or understand English The food was awful, I usually order from Vip sushi whose prices and food taste way better.</li><li>As we got seated, the manager did a great job in suggesting us the evening Chef 's special.</li><li>The food was decent once it came; had to get a manager to get the last of our four items.</li><li>The new manager is some young guy who 's ego is way bigger than it should be. and the server had a bad attitude and did n't do a good at replenishing drinks or cleaning tables.</li><li>The cheap manager did n't want to honour the coupon for the full value.</li><li>He was actually the manager, and one of his staff apparently did n't show up for work that morning.</li><li>Later hubby called &amp; talked to the manager to complain.</li><li>The manager came and made sure we we 're very happy with things.</li><li>I love this place but it seems to have changed hands because I 'm sitting here overhearing someone who seems to be the new manager entertaining the boys bellied up to the bar and the notion of turning it into yet another Irish pub. So long, best burger I 've ever had in Toronto along with food that actually has real flavour!: (.</li><li>I just think for such a popular location it will smart of them to get a second line. a miss Christine from head office I believe replied my facebook post she said she forwarded my email to their regional manager.</li><li>The manager clearly concurred as he whisked it away and delivered a steak- a nice gesture but they do n't seem to be in the league of any decent steak house I 've ever been to. background: my friend and I are both Chinese, and we have not tried any stlyle of steak before.</li><li>I finally go to the manager and ask him what 's happening.</li><li>Managed to get our bill eventually and the manager comped the dragon roll ( after much fight).</li><li>One of the suited manager put our Lobster down then picked it back up to turn around, then turns back to us and puts it down.</li><li>The manager 's response was just unbelievable.</li><li>FINALLY the last order came to the table and the manager said this one is on the house.</li><li>I should have probably read the reviews on yelp before going to the restaurant .. but I did n't .. .. btw before i get started why is there filtered reviews ? maybe i missed something ..; anyways went here for lunch with a co-worker because its close to the office .. the decor is okay and we were quickly seated but thats as good as it got .. none of the staff make eye contact, everything is slow even tho the establishment was n't busy, there was just no importance on quality .. we ordered one of the lunch specials, the pricing is good, but I learned a long time ago, you get what you pay for, so for $ 7 to $ 15 you can get a salad, appetizer, sushi, chicken/beef, dessert, etc the food was cold and really average, they forgot our sushi and when we pointed it out to the manager he said he would take it off our bill .. a whole $ 1.20 ?? for 6 sushi rolls .. like i said u get what u pay for .. my co-worker, who is from hong kong blasted the manager, but he was no help ... so i will never go back .. but the experience got me back to using yelp!;).</li><li>I should have probably read the reviews on yelp before going to the restaurant .. but I did n't .. .. btw before i get started why is there filtered reviews ?
