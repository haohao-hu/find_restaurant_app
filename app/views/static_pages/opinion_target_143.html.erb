4lb Broiled Lobster* 2lb lobster was $ 57.00 and 4lb lobster is $ 97.00* You can choose the lobster to be steamed or broiled* I mostly had the broiled 4lb ( obviously shared it with others)* Steamed had much clean taste since no other seasoning was used* Broiled lobster tasted more rich with the crust on top* 4lb lobster was so huge the claw was as big as my face* They get pretty messy to eat so you are given a plastic bib to put around your neck Summary: I walked in not expecting much but I fully enjoyed the meal at The Lobster Trap.</li><li>I ended up with a lobster bisque -- which was too creamy and very skimpy on the lobster.</li><li>Ate here with my fiance about a year ago for a special occasion and their lobster bisque was so delicious!</li><li>But would go back just for the lobster bisque!</li><li>Add to that 2 Lobster Bisques, coconut shrimp, and sometimes another Lobster Bisque.</li><li>I capitalize the ' Lobster Bisque' because it deserves to be addressed as so.</li><li>Their lobster bisque is the best in town!</li><li>I always get 1.5 lbs lobster along with lobster bisque and salad.</li><li>We are in a lobster restaurant and we order the Lobster bisque.</li><li>When the Lobster bisque arrived, it surprises us that the soup is creamy in color.</li><li>I still remember last time here in this restaurant and any other restaurants that I order the Lobster bisque is orange reddish in color.</li><li>I wonder whether the soup base for both clam chowder and lobster bisque are the same in the kitchen.</li><li>It is not real lobster bisque.</li><li>The bottom line is the lobster is still very good but the lobster bisque is out and the price has been increased.</li><li>We started off with the lobster bisque ( soup) that was so creamy and delicious that we had to eventually go home and try to replicate it.</li><li>We ordered the escargot, seafood platter ( I think that 's what it was called, it consisted of shrimp, salmon, lobster tail, and another type of fish ... all very delicious), and 1.5lbs of lobster broiled ( highly recommend very delicious), garlic bread, and baked potato.The owner also gave us free soup ( the lobster bisque) which was amazing !!</li><li>We usually get a lobster ( maybe 1.5 lbs) broiled, salad, fries or roast potato, drink, garlic bread and awesome lobster bisque.</li><li>The women who served us had mentioned she had been working here for over 20 years, she was extremely friendly, shared a little bit of history with us on the restaurant, brought us a free lobster bisque, and desert.</li><li>Lobster bisque was a must try, I will be ordering that next time for sure.</li><li>We also ordered lobster bisque on the side.</li><li>Funny thing is, the waitress/owner, who was not very pleased that we were reluctant to order more food, actually put on a lobster bisque ( $ 10) on the bill without even asking us and brought 3 bowls, saying `` oh you must try the soup, it 's really good.</li><li>FOOD: the food came pretty fast probably because we came as soon as it opened. garlic bread was alright- nothing special. lobster bisque ( $ 10) was pretty good- I think this is their specialty since the owner wanted us to try it so bad. lobster grandin ( $ 12) was alright.</li><li>The salad is fine, the chowder is good, but everyone knows you need to go for a big creamy bowl of lobster bisque.</li><li>I suggest a large bowl of lobster bisque!</li><li>The Lobster bisque was a floured concoction with no lobster meat to be found.</li><li>Lobster bisque: I remember 10 years ago the lobster bisque was THE best soup in Toronto.</li><li>She gave us extra lobster, extra lobster bisque, extra salads, extra dessert at the end.</li><li>So my mom obliged and got a lobster bisque which I did n't try.</li><li>The lobster bisque was absolutely horrible being that it seemed like it was mixed with corn starch to thicken the soup and watered down because they were too cheap to make a real lobster bisque.</li><li>The lobster bisque was absolutely horrible being that it seemed like it was mixed with corn starch to thicken the soup and watered down because they were too cheap to make a real lobster bisque.</li><li>I 'm not paying $ 42 again to drink watered down lobster bisque and not-real filet mignon.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
