<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 143' %><h2>crab<br />occurrence: 47</h2><div><ol><li>The name to me sounded bizarre but it had crab and shrimp and was actually quite good!</li><li>Since we 're cutting out one of the most expensive ingredients in Chinese cooking -- shellfish like lobster, crab, abalone -- I would have expected the chef to choose ingredients that are finer or of higher quality or just special in some way to substitute.</li><li>For this price point, definitely not enough crab.</li><li>First time, all dishes were great, fried pork chop, marinated raw crab, and tofu soup.</li><li>First of all, it 's almost impossible to find the proper type of crab that wo n't break your teeth ....</li><li>Ordered: Gae-Jang ( marinated raw crab) 2/5* Plate of marinated crab for $ 12.99* You can order soy sauce based or spicy sauce based* I ordered soy sauce based Gae Jang* Basically you get 2 small crabs all cracked up* Soy sauce marinade was decent but a little too sweet* What turned me off from this is how the crabs did n't taste very fresh* Although it is marinated, because you are eating this raw- freshness is quite important* My mouth felt a little dry/tough after eating this and it was n't very pleasant* The claw part was n't cracked and there was no way I could break it with my teeth* I was quite disappointed with this dish since I was looking forward to it Ordered: CheolPan JjooGgooMi ( baby squid stir fry) 5/5* Baby squid stir fried with vegetables and ricecake for two people at $ 19.99* This was recommended by my friend who 's had it before* It 's meant for 2 people and cooked at your table* This is very spicy ( be aware !!)* It came with lots of baby squid, ricecakes and vegetables* Sauce was very intense in flavor ( spices) and it was good to eat with rice* I thought it was kind of odd how they had broccoli in it* I loved this dish and would go back just for it Complimentary: Kong Bi Ji* This is a grinded up bean paste that people like to eat with the rice* I am not a big fan of beans .... or grinded up beans so I did n't really enjoy it* But my friend said it was really good!</li><li>While the crab was fresh, there was no other flavors such as sweet or salty and the crab was just .. bland and spicy.</li><li>While the crab was fresh, there was no other flavors such as sweet or salty and the crab was just .. bland and spicy.</li><li>This place has korean raw crab `` Ge-Jang'' that is one of my absolute favorites.</li><li>Overall, you must try the raw crab if you do come to this restaurant !!!</li><li>Food: 9/10- raw crab: 10/10. love it!</li><li>Gen was a big fan of the special soy sauce blend and taught us to eat it by taking some of the rice and putting it into the shell of the crab in order to use up the soy sauce blend.</li><li>The difference between cooked crabs and raw crabs is that the meat in the raw crab was very gooey, with its texture and consistency similar to that of egg yolk.</li><li>It also took a bit of time to chew through the shell and legs of the crab in order to eat it.</li><li>They have sauced crab.</li><li>Second time, we tried the crab, the recommended one year old kimchi soup, and seafood tofu soup.</li><li>The crab was quite expansive and it was not worth it.</li><li>And sexy summer rolls are the non-fried ones- they have avocado, lettuce, crab or shrimp, other greenery and come wrapped in a see through rice paper. yummmmzeeerrrzzzzz The staff at the Sheppard and Yonge location are super nice.</li><li>We end up ordering two pizzas, my wife ordered the one with pepperoni and roasted mushrooms and red peppers, while I ordered the seafood pizza ( with shrimps, scallops, and fake crab).</li><li>Food comes out randomly which sometimes works and sometimes does n't. .. like when we got the banana fritters ( dessert) before the spicy crab.</li><li>There was only a very small amount of crab and the roll did not look very good.</li><li>THE ROLLS- standouts were the green dragon, volcano and spicy crab.</li><li>It featured good quality pasta, and an assortment of well-cooked seafood, including scallops, shrimp, crab, clams and mussels.</li><li>Sports are here with 9 television screens inside a space of no more than 800 sq ft. and the hermit crab in me loves to get away on a weekday night at about 9pm when this location is almost always empty.</li><li>I 've tried places with their crab fried rice and its always good but I did notice that this restaurant does n't get stingy when it comes to putting the crab in your rice !!</li><li>So each spoonful I taste -- i get lots of crab meat in there** real crab, not crab meat* !!</li><li>One thing I found out is if you want a candle for your butter you have to ask or they will bring it in a little cup ( if your a seafood fan you want the piping hot butter) My meal comes my crab is cut into small pieces witch I am not a fan of Prefer the whole legs ( personal preference) they were cooked perfect.</li><li>My boyfriend is a bit of a seafood connoisseur, so after eating crab and lobster a dozen of times at Chinese restaurants, Red Lobster and at home, we decided to go for something different.</li><li>The `` crab'' in it did n't really taste like crab, plus it was battered and deep fried and it just made the dish feel too heavy.</li><li>Will definitely be coming back !!- when there are loads of chinese folks as patrons, you 've come to the right spot.- definately try their house super bowl congee ( shrimp, scallop, salmon, grouper, crab, surf clam) and the fried chili turnip patties ... you will not regret it.- will definately be back.</li><li>My friend had a noodle dish w/crab that was nothing but flavorless noodles and nearly no crab.</li><li>HUGE pieces of Shrimp, Crab, Surf Clams, Salmon, Garoupa and other stuff.</li><li>The crab was n't really detectable until I added salt.</li><li>I ordered the Super House Congee- it came with shrimp, crab, salmon, scallop, grouper and green onions.</li><li>Deep Fried Wonton ......... 10/10 Soft shell crab fried rice was a pleasant surprise even though the amount of crab was not that great.</li><li>Spider roll is okay too but I do n't like crab.</li><li>The spider roll is a giant thing, filled with tasty crunchy soft-shell crab:) Seating is a little limited, but not as limited as the parking in the roundabout.</li><li>The crab and the lobster were fried in the same tasteless junk probably used to grease door hinges.</li><li>The prices were very reasonable as well, $ 5.99 for the spicy crab and the other two rolls were $ 4.99 each.</li><li>I ordered House B, and my friend had House D. The House B combo included assorted sushi ( including salmon, shrimp, and fake crab), a california roll ( 6 pcs), spicy salmon roll ( 6 pcs), and a crispy avocado hand roll.</li><li>Here the crab and pork soup dumplings are the best.</li><li>Favourite dishes to order spicy crab, spicy shrimp and Vegetable rice.</li><li>It seems that the menu is geared towards impressing the Chinese palette for fresh seafood ( i.e. lobster, crab), which- as a herbivore- I ca n't say too much about.</li><li>( BTW ... the crab that is offered on a couple of the dishes is canned.</li><li>The novelty with the Mongolian Grill is that you are presented with a wide variety of raw meats ( beef, pork, chicken, and lamb) and vegetables, some seafoods ( shrimps, fake crab and squid rings), noodles ( egg, rice, udon, etc.) and a stupefying selection of soupy sauces ( spicy, curry, honey garlic ... more than 10 in total) and condiment sauces ( ginger, garlic, oyster ... more than 20 in total).</li><li>The congee was good, lots of seafood variety with salmon, shrimp, crab etc. the cantonese chow mein was mediocre, it 's my brothers fave so we end up ordering that but I felt the noodles were too crispy for my liking.</li><li>I also ordered a crab and fish maw soup which was so bad that no one at the table would have any and I ordered a large bowl: ( It tasted like they were running out of soup and decided to reheat it and fill it up with water and egg white.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
