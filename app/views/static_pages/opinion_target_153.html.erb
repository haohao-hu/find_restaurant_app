<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 153' %><h2>ramen<br />occurrence: 43</h2><div><ol><li>MAJORLY overpriced, tiny portions, tasteless ramen ... worse than instant noodles.</li><li>It 's slightly absurd to me how a bowl of instant ramen is like $ 3 when it 's $ 0.50 a bowl at the Asian supermarket, ( what ?).</li><li>The ramen was good, but it lacked flavour.</li><li>The ramen was a seafood ramen, but I got a total of one piece of ( frozen, still cold) shrimp and two minuscule pieces of mussel.</li><li>I always order JS1 with chicken, adding ramen, cheese and dubokki ( rice cakes).</li><li>I can barely found any seafood there and the instant ramen is just as good as what my Yelp friend have been making for me.</li><li>We ordered the dak galbi with ramen, cheese and rice cakes.</li><li>We had added ramen and cheese ( $ 2 each) and even with those added, the dish was tiny.</li><li>Dak galbi ( marinated chicken stir-fry on hot plate- traditionally dark meat chicken is used, but I do n't know what kind they use here) is their specialty but a la carte menu is offered too. banchan has the usual napa cabbage kimchi, beansprouts, but the one i especially like is their simple but good steamed broccoli with a dash of gochujang. personally i like gochujang with everything, but it may not be fore everyone. they also have a mashed potato banchan which i did not try. if your order the dak galbi, i recommend extra orders of tteok ( rice cake sticks), sweet potato and pumpkin. cheese ( looks and tastes like mozzarella) is offered too, giving it a fusion/modern twist. ramen is also on the menu. service is attentive, friendly and pleasant. quite a roomy restaurant, which is surprising if you merely look from the outside. unlike many other korean restaurants in toronto, you can actually linger here for a while, given enough seating for everyone. will DEFINITELY come again.</li><li>Only downside is that the ramen was a tad dry.</li><li>You 'll probably need to top it off with some extras like rice cake, ramen, or rice.</li><li>And my Yelp Friend ordered: Budae jjigae- A huge hot pot of hot dogs, pork, ham, veggie, instant ramen and even a Kraft cheese- I felt like I am back in my University years that I would just throw anything in some spicy broth and start eating, the good old days ...</li><li>Anyhow, the sashimi was just ok and the ramen was n't very flavourful.</li><li>The ramen is the best that I have had in Toronto.</li><li>The service is quick and ramen is amazing as well!</li><li>The Miso veggie ramen was a little bland so I will suggest picking something else.</li><li>Not to be confused with `` Kenzo'' the ramen chain by the same name that is downtown and near Yonge and shep.</li><li>While vacationing in Toronto, Canada around the winter time ( November time frame to be exact), I wanted some decent ramen and Takoyaki balls.</li><li>My ramen was decent for not actually being in Japan but the Takoyaki balls were on point.</li><li>Good for a quick ramen fix.</li><li>The `` house special'' ramen is the one that comes in milky pork-bone broth.</li><li>This is definitely the best ramen I 've had in GTA so far.</li><li>The side of spicy pickled daikon is a nice touch to cleanse the palate and cut some of the grease. if you are uptown and want ramen, Kenzo is your best ramen place to satisfy that noodle craving. although the establishment is korean run, the chef trained in japan on ramen and you will get an honest japanese style ramen from here. they dont have a really huge menu, but it is quality over quantity.</li><li>They have authentic okonomiyaki that they make fresh and serve on a sizzling platter with all the fixings. their gyoza is fresh and cooked to perfection. their takoyaki ( round pancake balls with a piece of octopus) is authentic and fresh too. less soup base options to ajisen, but if you find the equivalent here, you should find that it is less salty, less msg. being korean run, seeing any kimchi or pickled radish actually makes sense, and i think there is kalbi ( korean beef short ribs) on the menu as well. their service is not fast, and this place can be quite busy at times, but if you want ramen and you are not downtown on dundas or queen street, this is the best ramen you can get. i can vouch for the quality and consistency of this particular location, dunno about other Kenzo locations. i miss the tempura they used to have at this location, but it was taken off the menu. if you want an authentic bowl of ramen or okonomiyaki that is the closest thing to getting to Japan and having one there, this is the place if you are uptown.</li><li>The menu is n't really that big, I mean there 's basic ramen, hot ramen, `` ramen delicacies'' and some appetizers.</li><li>The ramen here is awesome!</li><li>Most of their ramen here is tasty and i doubt you 'll be disappointed.</li><li>The ramen was spicy and the pork pieces were melt in your mouth delicious.</li><li>Delicious Gyoza, Tacomaki that melt in your mouth, and the ramen ... complex, flavorful, delicious.</li><li>Decent ramen but afterwards, our group of 4 were wickedly tired and thirsty.</li><li>The ramen was just okay, nothing to write home about, however, the service was dismal.</li><li>Anyhow, the ramen is pretty good.</li><li>So when there is good udon and pho nearby, why should you settle for overpriced, underfilling, simply OK ramen ?</li><li>I love spicy food, and this ramen was definitely right up my alley.</li><li>Nice place, good ramen.</li><li>No nonsense atmosphere with a focus on quality, fresh and hearty ramen.</li><li>I like the one on Yonge better. we had king of king ramen. the ramen was so yummy and spicy. the `` chasu'' ( BBQ pork) and noodle are tender and chewy. specially the grilled mark chasu, not too dry and gave u a miso soup flavour.</li><li>I always cringe when I hear people touting Ajisan as `` good ramen'' ..</li><li>Your ramen looks very close to the pictures in the menu you ordered from.</li><li>I ca n't say the same for the other locations, but the North York location is a sure bet if you ask me. good amount of parking either at the front or back. the ramen is really good and flavorful, bowls are really big for the price you pay ( you will be full) unlike some places that charge $ 15 a bowl and you leave hungry. there 's lots of choices and i tried a few, ca n't go wrong here with the ramen. the takoyaki is way overprice tho.</li><li>My first exposure to ramen was the dry msg ladden instant noodle packages ..</li><li>The basic ramen was excellent.</li><li>We tried the king 's ramen, shio ramen, and gyoza- pleased with every aspect of our meals.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
