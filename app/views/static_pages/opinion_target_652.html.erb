<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 652' %><h2>bi bim bap<br />occurrence: 6</h2><div><ol><li>My personal favourite dishes are the bi bim bap and the black bean noodles.</li><li>There are only a few menu 's here, beef, mixed, seafood, bean paste ' soon tofu', comes with stone bowl rice and ' noo roong ji' afterwards. bi bim bap, bul gogi and some others which most of them are pretty good.</li><li>If you are not a big fan of hot soup, that 's okay because their bi bim bap ( rice w/ veggies, egg, beef, mix w/ Korean hot sauce served in hot stone bowl) and bul go gi ( marinated beef on sizzling plate) is amazing too.</li><li>Note: you do n't get this hot sticky rice bowl when you order bi bim bap.</li><li>When bi bim bap comes out, use your SPOON to mix in your Korean hot sauce and really mix your whole bowl thoroughly before you start eating.</li><li>Hence called bi bim bap ( Mixed Rice).</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
