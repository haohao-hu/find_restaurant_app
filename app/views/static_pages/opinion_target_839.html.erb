<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 839' %><h2>Peanut Chicken<br />occurrence: 5</h2><div><ol><li>Peanut Chicken- felt a bit more like Thai food .. reminded me of satay.</li><li>Their rice noodle w/ black bean beef is also well delicious ( I 'm a texture slut, so rice noodles are always a must for me @ SG despite them not being very hakka-esque) I could go on and on with dishes like the Peanut Chicken, Sizzling Shrimp and Spicy Spare Garlic Ribs, but yo just need to go and experience it for yourself.</li><li>Crispy ginger chicken and spicy peanut chicken are favorite.</li><li>But the food is absolutely wonderful. we are regular customer, s at this restaurant, Tonight we ordered the usual, our favourte dish is peanut chicken, we brought our three dish, s home and upon opening the chicken we saw half the dish was peanut sauce and less than half the usual amount of chicken, I called the restaurant and spoke to the owner for ten minutes, she insisted that it was made the same as always, It was not at all, we paid 11,95 for peanut sauce and a small amount of chicken,, The arrogant owner could not care less, refusing to credit us for next time we picked up, or d delivering a new dish to our home, This place the staff is unfriendly, not well mannered, and horrible customer service, and the food was awful, except for the fried rice, it was good, If your looking for bad service this is the place to go, the customer is never right,, be warned,.</li><li>The chicken dishes are always really good though- definitely try the spicy peanut chicken ... verrry GOOD.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
