<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 111' %><h2>roll<br />occurrence: 61</h2><div><ol><li>Oh, try the love roll, bulgogi, spicy chicken, spicy salmon roll and sushi pizza! you 're welcome.</li><li>The only reason I gave this play the second star was that the `` scorpion roll'' as they called it actually did n't taste too bad.</li><li>The menu was ridiculously expensive- $ 15.50 for the roll we ordered ( sorry, forgot the name, but it sucked!)- we had to pay $ 1 extra for spicy mayo, which they gave quite a bit in a small dish.</li><li>Instead they gave literally less than a dab of that same spicy mayo from the roll I had before on each of the maki.</li><li>The color was kind of off- all sashimi had a warm taste and it was covered in water- it just did n't taste pleasant, we ordered a second round of sashimi .. same thing Rolls- Our roll order was forgotten on the FIRST ticket .. mmm .. we ordered their signature roll .. it was really meh .... and the nori was chewy handroll- the Nori was very soft when it came ... portion of rice to filling .. rice more .. filling a bit .. no good Hot Food- beef roll enoki, and green onions, short ribs, grilled shrimp, grilled cutlet, grilled mushroom, grilled beef, grilled chicken heart, etc etc ( The shrimp did not taste fresh again) but overall the beef were all pretty good! ( or 2nd order some of the grill items were once again forgotten !!!! they were n't even full for the evening !!)</li><li>One notable roll was the lion head which was spicy salmon with tuna and avocado on top.</li><li>I was n't too hungry so I just got a futomaki roll, but even for this simple roll it was one of the best I 've had.</li><li>Servers were quick, courteous and knowledgeable ... and initially when my server thought I has n't had sushi before, her approach to explaining the difference between a maki/ hand roll &amp; sashimi did n't make me feel like an idiot.</li><li>I also had a beautiful roll, which had spicy salmon roll ( premade many many hours ago) as a base so that was automatically bad.</li><li>Crazy roll and sun set action roll tasted alright but were very greasy ( menu said the latter includes cucumber but it did not).</li><li>Crazy roll and sun set action roll tasted alright but were very greasy ( menu said the latter includes cucumber but it did not).</li><li>We also ordered three rolls, Spicy Killer ( i think ?) which Mr. H and I assumed was shrimp tempura on the inside but the entire roll was deep fried ( makes me think the menu is very clear).</li><li>The sashimi was okay, the roll was okay.</li><li>I ended up ordering 4 different roll and finished it by myself.</li><li>I realized the roll is very small in size but not by pieces.</li><li>Apparently their most popular roll is the tataki attack and it lived up to the hype.</li><li>We also tried the blue fin tuna tartar only offered on weekends, the lion roll, crazy roll and the small sushi and maki combo.</li><li>We had agedashi tofu ( crispy tofu in teriyaki sauce), electric banana ( which was weird at first but actually quite tasty), beautiful roll ( scallop, avocado, smoked salmon), yam tempura.</li><li>We ordered the calamari, tataki roll, beautiful roll and a miso soup.</li><li>We ordered a dynamite roll, spicy salmon and crazy roll I think ( the one with spicy scallop) Rolls were all fresh and tasted good.</li><li>Tataki Attack Roll: $ 9.95 | 8pcs of Crab, scallop, avocado, mayo + albacore tuna tataki on top This was such a great roll, and, as you know, I 'm a sucker for aburi rolls.</li><li>I order their veggie bento box, which comes with tempera, rice, salad, soup, a roll and a side dish ( different ones, depends on the day).</li><li>I came for dinner at about 6pm and ordered the sweet potato tempura, harumaki ( spring roll), crunch roll, green dragon roll and red bean ice cream.</li><li>3 bento boxes, appetizer, hand roll, sushi and sashimi.</li><li>The sauce on this roll is excellent and they have avocado in it.</li><li>The roll is quite big so if you do n't have a huge, huge appetite, it may be worth pawning a few rolls off to your friend or packing it home ( word of warning- it is not as good once it 's cooled down).</li><li>I also had the avocado yam ( tempura) roll which was very good, if a bit haphazardly assembled.</li><li>Their sexy summer roll was great too, topped with mango sauce and has mango inside.</li><li>It was n't until near the end, when we had to tell a different server that our roll did n't come, did it finally come after he manually input it into the computer.</li><li>But the roll was disappointing.</li><li>There was only a very small amount of crab and the roll did not look very good.</li><li>The roll is made with mango, crab meat salad, and mint leaves topped with a spicy mango sauce.</li><li>I thought the roll was sweet, but tasted wonderful despite the lack of any real spiciness.</li><li>Dragon roll is very dissapointing, 9 $ for tiny roll only consisting of rice, tempura shrimp, green onion, nori, fish roe.</li><li>The crazy love roll were great too.</li><li>Just add some cream cheese into the roll, I 'm willing to pay for it.</li><li>The rice paper was not of good quality and the roll itself was not very flavorful.</li><li>I got assorted sashimi, philadelphia rolls, fantastic roll ( torched Salmon with asparagus) and dynamite rolls.</li><li>The layer of rice on the outside of the roll is thin, and the sesame seeds add a nice chew.</li><li>The dessert was much smaller than we had anticipated, but the deep friend `` roll'' was perfectly done.</li><li>I usually get the dynamite roll ( one roll is probably enough for one person) and the sushi bong special and that is more than enough for my wife and I. Sushi Bong is amazing!</li><li>I would recommend their Unagi special roll is the best, dynamic roll and spicy salmon are top 2 on my list.</li><li>Recommendations: Dynamite Roll is byfar their most popular roll.</li><li>I always end up over-ordering because I think to myself, `` one roll ca n't be enough for one person'' but yep, it always is.</li><li>Each roll is also easily double and sometimes triple the size of a normal sushi restaurant.</li><li>The crab meat in the roll is real crab meat not crab sticks but I think it would taste even better with crab sticks ...</li><li>STOP PUTTING SESAME SEEDS ALL OVER EVERYTHING !!! i thought the roll was deep fried because i was covered in this stuff !!!</li><li>The roll was pretty good and came fast.</li><li>The spider roll was so long, the whole roll could not be fitted across the container but cut in half.</li><li>Here are my favourites at this place:- Shrimp Tempura ( HUGE Shrimps with a nice crispy finish)- Red Dragon ( This roll is wrapped up in delicious smoked salmon)- Green Dragon ( a delicious combo of shrimp, crab and veggies wrapped up in fresh green avocado)- Golden California Rolls ( Not as healthy but it is fried to perfection and melts in your mouth)- Chicken Teriyaki bento box ( tons of food!</li><li>The shrimp tempura in the roll was also obviously old and re-fried as it was very hard and looked extremely stale.- and finally, the spicy salmon roll.</li><li>The Yam Tempura roll was also bland while the California roll was alright.</li><li>The roll was really good- better than I expected.</li><li>Hamachi hand roll tasted like it was scraped up from the bottom of a dumpster.</li><li>The best roll on the menu is the deluxe jumbo spider roll.</li><li>Fresh roll with shrimp: 1 order comes with 2 decent sized rolls.</li><li>I just might upgrade from my devotion to open-ended egg rolls for this sophisticated roll.</li><li>I asked the man working there if he could possibly make me a specific type of roll that they did n't have displayed and with no hesitation he complied.</li><li>Sashimi on the top of the rolls were fresh but the roll itself has too much rice which fills you up really fast.</li><li>It comes at a higher price tag though, $ 12.95 for 8 pieces but this is the roll of all rolls if you 're into spicy salmon.</li><li>Ca n't rmm the roll he got but it was okay.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
