<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 950' %><h2>seafood platter<br />occurrence: 4</h2><div><ol><li>The prices are alright, seafood platter which is like a sampler of seafood + halibut is around 16, comes with fries and salad.</li><li>We ordered the escargot, seafood platter ( I think that 's what it was called, it consisted of shrimp, salmon, lobster tail, and another type of fish ... all very delicious), and 1.5lbs of lobster broiled ( highly recommend very delicious), garlic bread, and baked potato.</li><li>We ordered the seafood platter for two. it came with some tiny oysters that looked old and some pieces of bread with cream cheese on top to put the smoked salmon on.</li><li>We ordered a prime rib ( my fav!) wanted it rare, but it came out kind of medium-ish and got a seafood platter ( $ 65) which was not that amazing, 1 lobster tail, 1 jumbo shrimp, 2 oysters Rockefeller, some scallops, king crab/Alaskan king crab legs. sounds like a lot, but it is n't cause it all fits into one plate! but anyways overall the price is fair and the food is good, just not the best.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
