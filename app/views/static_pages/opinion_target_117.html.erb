<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 117' %><h2>tip<br />occurrence: 57</h2><div><ol><li>If you do n't earn your tip, you do n't get a tip.</li><li>And I tipped a generous tip even though I did not enjoyed the food much.</li><li>I paid using my Amex Gold card, left a $ 0.00 tip and proceeded to exit the establishment.</li><li>It 's good Asian food at a decent price ( ~ $ 15 incl tax &amp; tip).</li><li>Luckily the tip was n't a lot.</li><li>She gave us the bill while we were still eating ( bill for soda and soy milk clearly visible despite not having bought it out until reminded twice), and when we paid she demanded a 20% tip when we 've already given a very UNDESERVING 10%.</li><li>First, the receipt did n't even have the tip added to it.</li><li>Hey, no skin off my back if you want to be sneaky and not get my extra 5% tip.</li><li>By the end of the evening, we not only had not received a single apology, but insult to injury, we were shocked by the automatic addition of a $ 90 tip to the bill, without acknowledging that our experience truly did not deserve that gratuity.</li><li>The Miller was unable and/or unwilling to improve our experience, and grabbed the tip anyway.</li><li>I like the decor- feels authentic. not the music though. every time we get there it 's a collection of oldies ... still listenable ... but why not japanese classical music ? anyway. none of my friends every complained about the food. they only have one veg bento box on lunch special but it 's pretty good and very filling. tea + miso soup + orange at the end = included. they also introduced discount cards- collect 4 lunch stamps and get 5th one with 13% discount. collect 9 and get 10th with $ 10 discount. sounds as a good idea. the lunches end up costing around $ 12 with tax + tip.</li><li>Ambience: 3/5, more of an Asian feel of decor; perhaps because it 's in North York Price: 3/5, fair and great service deserved a big tip.</li><li>After handing back the debit machine and the receipt being printed, the wait staff said ' you did n't leave a tip', I proceeded to tell them that their tip ( and I give more than the prerequisite) was on the table in cash.</li><li>My wallet was thinner by $ 65.00 including a tip.</li><li>Basically, no tip, no lechon for you.</li><li>For $ 50 including tax and a hefty tip, my boyfriend and I enjoyed on a Saturday night Sinagong ( tamarind) soup with prawns medium, Pancit Sampaguita medium, Lechon Kwahili medium ( fried pork), and Sampaguita dinner for two which included rice, lumpia ( spring rolls), deep fried chicken wings, and mixed grilled pork and chicken.</li><li>With weekend pricing, dinner was $ 27 + tax + tip, which is pricier than my last two places, but is n't the price of everything going up ? ( especially in Canada these days ...)</li><li>As I thought about it more and more, I felt like this place deserved more then the tip I left them.</li><li>Two entr√©es, two desserts, one water, two sodas, and an appetizer ended up costing $ 71, plus a $ 25 tip ..</li><li>We did not leave the typical 15% tip since it was n't earned- we found that we felt rushed, the server was not attentive, and the deep fried banana batter was undercooked.</li><li>You really expect a $ 15 tip on a $ 30 dinner.</li><li>Remember we were not in a self-serve restaurant and you got the tip for a reason.</li><li>P. S. leave a good tip whenever you 're at a restaurant, especially if you enjoyed your experience!</li><li>With drinks/ tax/ tip, expect it to be about $ 20 per person.</li><li>Altogether, it was $ 46 + tip which is pretty reasonable for a sushi meal.</li><li>TL; DR: I am a paying customer that contributes to the funding of this business to remain intact ... and you 're acting like I 'm an inconvenience, as you harass me for a measly tip ( that is not mandatory and to be given out of generosity for the SERVERS not owner) and yet ironically, I provided the recommendation that a large birthday dinner be held here.</li><li>I gestured to her to tell her that she short-changed me in which she responded very rudely `` 10% tip!''</li><li>My sister told her that it was because the service that we received did not deserve the typical 15% tip, they were lucky that they even got the 10%.</li><li>We had to ask million times for menu, tea, water, bill etc. we were very unhappy about the service and left a small tip.</li><li>I usually do n't give below 15% tip, but they were astonishing terrible.</li><li>A tad bit more of a kick than I thought there would be from the chili flakes on the tip.</li><li>But the only thing is they ask for 10% tip so be aware!</li><li>$ 7 bucks with tax and small tip for a medium.</li><li>I had a Bento box with shrimp &amp; vegetables tempura, for $ 6.99 + tax &amp; tip.</li><li>I looked at her and asked `` so do you want a tip ?''.</li><li>As I recall, tip was n't mandatory and based on the time we had at their establishment, I definitely wo n't be back.</li><li>The price is right, we paid $ 30 incl. tip.</li><li>Overall a great experience. i was sooo offended. as the manager of a bar, i understand some things take time, but being rudely greeted by the bar staff and ignored for 10 minutes while they do nothing is pretty bad to begin. having the barstaff whispering to each other while blatantly pointing at my friend is obscene. we asked to move to a table. they said fine, no one brought us menus or asked us if we wanted drinks. the bitchy blond bartender walked right by the table 4 times, making a point of not looking at us and cleaning tables right next to ours, yet still ignoring us. then she walked to the edge of the bar and twirled her hair for a bit, all the while making sure not to make eye contact with us. we finally went over to the bar and asked the guy if we could get menus or drinks or service, explaining to him that we have been waiting for ten minutes, when he rudely informed me that i had only been waiting 20 seconds. so i asked for the bill from our drink at the bar, had my tip rudely returned to me, amid more whispering and pointing at us. im disgusted and quite upset about being treated like that, especially because i used to be quite a regular there, and im a big tipper and very polite ( dont forget i manage a bar, and it should be all about customer service). i wouldnt recomend this place to anybody for any reason. maybe a different location, not this one.</li><li>I paid with my credit card and the lady accidentally hit `` okay'' for me, missing the tip section, I had no cash on me and they would n't swipe my credit card again to tip ( because it costs to use my card), so I do n't know how she expected me to tip.</li><li>Overall for two people the bill came us to $ 30 for 2 dishes and I gave a $ 4 tip even though think they deserve a lil less cause of their service but I do n't want to be chased down for a tip cause it has happened to me before in that area so did n't want to risk it.</li><li>I 'm going to put the same amount of energy and thought into writing this review as they did preparing my meal.- horrible attitude from the staff team, not a single trace of politeness ( slams menu on the table, rude comments and demeanor, etc)- dish came in a dirty bowl- was the standard for hygiene this low ? ( See picture below)- dish had a distinct taste of cigarette ash- I paid in cash and before I was able to collect my change, the waitress tried to take the money away and asked ( still rudely) if I was going to leave her a 40% tip.</li><li>Price wise, I paid 46 dollars for all our meals and that is with the tip, so the prices are decent.</li><li>The bill process took a long time and when I asked about the tip I was ignored ...</li><li>You 're not paying for tip ?" ( I initially gave an extra dollar as tip, which seemed decent given how much we had to wait) But actually having the audacity to grab my sleeve and ask for a tip was insulting.</li><li>The next time any waitress asks for more ' tip' I 'll throw in a nickel, maybe.</li><li>Bad food, expensive ( much of our $ 55 bbq kalbi was bone and sinew), and mandatory tip for extremely bad service.</li><li>Next thing, I see he is complaining that the tip is very low and that it should be at least 10% .... which is redicilous ....</li><li>I suggest that they put the mandatory 10% tipping on their menu if they are so worried that people have to pay 10% tip .... a very unpleasant approach and unprofessional .... and shameful.</li><li>Maybe they did n't care especially since they knew they were getting an automatic 15% tip.</li><li>The last person also paid with debit- and again, no tip.</li><li>She then proceeded to ask him how much tip he wanted to add.</li><li>I hope the chef got my tip because our waitress definitely did n't deserve it.</li><li>I always tip, and well, but someone trying to trick me into thinking its a `` delivery charge'' that I had n't paid yet vs a tip is really not okay.</li><li>If she had an attitude, she would have received zero tip.</li><li>Finally got to try and I was impressed. tried some sort of breakfast combo and all in all was pretty good, Would try again and will be seeking out GTA wide Wimpy 's on the late night tip for sure!</li><li>Total bill for 5 alcoholic beverages and 5 buffet dinners was $ 145 + tip.</li><li>Minimum 10% tip required ... on a party of 3.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
