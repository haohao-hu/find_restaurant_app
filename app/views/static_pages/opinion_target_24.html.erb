<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 24' %><h2>pork<br />occurrence: 288</h2><div><ol><li>Large chunks of slow roasted pork, however, the pork was cold.</li><li>In this past year, I 've been there for 2 times. the most recent visit I took a few pictures, the sweet &amp; sour pork with the orange slices ( please see pictures) beside the S &amp; S pork, the 3 of us ordered the Kalbijim ( Beef Rib Stew) and the Kimchi fried rice. the banchan are good, wait, they are great.</li><li>I like the fried zucchini the most, the kimchi has a spicy-sweetness with a bit of sour, and the broccoli with the white salad dressing was the best. unfortunately the main was not as good anymore. the kalbijim was not tender at all, and there is n't any potato or radish with the stew. while sweet and sour pork tasted ok, but the sauce was a bit thick, and the batter too. the worst was the Kimchi fried rice, the potion was really small, almost no Kimchi in it, and it taste really sour, not in a good way. and the fried rice was n't hot, not spicy hot and not temperature hot, yet it just came out of the kitchen less than 5 minutes after we order it.</li><li>Traditionally, Korean dumplings are filled with mixtures of tofu, shredded cabbage, bean sprouts, pork, shredded kimchi and so on ... so their fillings are less firm than Chinese dumpling fillings.</li><li>ArtBabe tried the pork variant.</li><li>The sandwich had a good serving of pulled pork on peameal bacon.</li><li>The pork was delicious, juicy and tender.</li><li>My Gyros meat looked like shaved sausages when it was suppose to be pork.</li><li>Everyone knows what they 're getting into with it; lo mein, spicy pork, etc.</li><li>They had salads, eggplant, veggies to the cooked meat from chicken in various styles from baked, breaded and stuffed to fish and pork.</li><li>I got for the pork, and he gets the lamb.</li><li>Had lots of pork, beef, shrimp and vegetables.</li><li>Ordered the spicy pork deopbap and my girlfriend ordered a bibimbap.</li><li>The pork was pretty tasty and I liked the stone bowl, but I did n't find anything else too special about it.</li><li>They specially in samgaetang which is a special healthy and delicious chicken soup ( with rice and noodles) but my boyfriend is obsessed with the spicy pork which is served sizzling on a hot plate with rice and side soup.</li><li>Cutlet pork was awesome too.</li><li>The spicy pork tastes home made.</li><li>The experience was almost perfect, but the fried pork in my katsudon was not crispy at all and was a little soggy.</li><li>What we did n't like: Spicy pork Dupbab Also ordered it as take-out.</li><li>The pork was on the very spicy side and I can eat spicy.</li><li>I wish they offered pork bone soup and kalbi beef.</li><li>Shredded pork in garlic sauce had a spice that I could n't place but did n't like ... a lot of dishes seemed to have traces of this spice and it made all the food taste the same.</li><li>The Singapore noodle was excellent, lots of chicken, pork, and shrimp!</li><li>Here you get big hunking slabs of pork slathered in the oh soo good sweet and sour sauce.</li><li>Bound by ancient laws and traditions, simple prohibitions against eating pork or seafood, or boiling a kid in it 's mothers ' milk have given rise to a series of increasingly restrictive rules which speak not only to the food that ends up on one 's plate, but the plate itself, the kitchen that prepares the food, and the whole supply chain from farm to table.</li><li>The pupusas are made to perfection, perfect ratio of masa to pork and cheese.</li><li>Or the sweet potato and pork is very bony, again few good pieces of meat.</li><li>I ordered the BBQ pork back ribs ( 10oz) with fries and warm apples.</li><li>There are a variety of other options including patties, goat curry, pork, and also a few varieties of bread ( raisin loaves are recommended), but if it 's your first time trekking to this spot, you ca n't go wrong with jerk chicken sandwich at just under $ 4.</li><li>If you stand outside the store for 10 minutes you will notice people walking consistently ( a person a minute) and coming out with a styrofoam container ( jerk chicken, pork or stew) or paper bags ( Jamaican patties, or Jerk Chicken on a bun).</li><li>I usually get a small pork, small chicken, two patties, and a coleslaw to share between two people.</li><li>Green Beans with minced pork was very bland and definitely could have used more salt.</li><li>But their deep fried dishes are a bit lacking and not crunchy enough despite the batter they use ( sweet n sour pork, small fishes).</li><li>I ordered a beef burrito, 2 pulled pork hard tacos and a chicken quesadilla.</li><li>The pork was very nice and tender.</li><li>The pancit was looooooooooooaded with shrimp, pork, and chicken.</li><li>It also came with 2 sauces on the side ... no idea what they were, but they did go well with the pork.</li><li>LOVED the crispy prawns ( spicy) and the crispy pork.</li><li>Tried the crispy pork that everyone recommends, it 's not bad, has crispy skin but the meat is on the dry side, definitely tried much better one elsewhere Since we came in 5, we got to try multiple dishes.</li><li>For $ 50 including tax and a hefty tip, my boyfriend and I enjoyed on a Saturday night Sinagong ( tamarind) soup with prawns medium, Pancit Sampaguita medium, Lechon Kwahili medium ( fried pork), and Sampaguita dinner for two which included rice, lumpia ( spring rolls), deep fried chicken wings, and mixed grilled pork and chicken.</li><li>The spring rolls with shrimp and pork were ok.</li><li>My go to dishes are:- Banh beo bi- Banh cuon ( with/without sausage)- Com thap cam ( grilled pork, grilled chicken, shredded pork, steamed egg, fried egg)- and of course PHO!</li><li>The fresh rolls with shrimp and pork also good, pork was sliced thin enough unlike some places too thick.</li><li>The fresh rolls with shrimp and pork also good, pork was sliced thin enough unlike some places too thick.</li><li>They had pork belly for 29.99 $ if I recall correctly.</li><li>I could tell they are using some pork broth because the flavour tastes more like pork than chicken which is a bit overwhelming when I wanted a cleaner not so rich taste.</li><li>The menu said pork bone soup with potatoes.</li><li>- Enoki pork roll- a fantastic combo of tasty pork and the satisfying bite of enoki mushrooms- squid sushi- possibly the best sashimi squid I 've ever had.</li><li>We had:- Garlic fried rice It 's a must to soak up all the sauces- Lechon kawali ( roast pork) Crispy crackly skin and soft meat ...</li><li>I had a quail egg ( tasted canned), a wonton ( lots of shrimp and pork filling, I wished there was more than just 1), a shrimp ( a good size, but not completely de-veined), 2 pieces of squid ( tasted rubbery), a piece of BBQ pork ( good flavour and not too fatty), 2 pieces of thinly sliced liver ( I do n't usually like liver, but this was ok), 2 pieces of thinly sliced heart ( I gave this to my dad because other than liver I do n't eat organ meats), and a fried fish ball sliced in two ( tasted good).</li><li>I had a quail egg ( tasted canned), a wonton ( lots of shrimp and pork filling, I wished there was more than just 1), a shrimp ( a good size, but not completely de-veined), 2

heart ( I gave this to my dad because other than liver I do n't eat organ meats), and a fried fish ball sliced in two ( tasted good).</li><li>We got an order of pancake and it was this fabulous looking thing ( see my pics) stuffed with bean sprouts and bit of shrimp and pork.</li><li>However, be warned, the last time I was there, I ordered this dish and the pork was not tender ( very dry).</li><li>The pork in their pork bone soup was actually meaty!</li><li>Even though this is supposedly a sushi place, I already have my favourite spots for good sushi so this is simply one of my go-to spots for breaded deep-fried pork cutlet-y goodness!</li><li>The chunks of pork were huge.</li><li>Jerk pork is one of the best I 've had.</li><li>I have n't tried their other dishes but they would use the same pork or chicken in the sandwich as they would for their dishes.</li><li>I had a pozole ( spicey stewed pork, corn soup), it was a good portion as it came with a fried tortilla with sour cream, and all the condiments to put into the soup ( radish, lettuce, oregano, cayenne pepper powder, onions) my husband had the combo which came with an enchilada, a burrito, and refried beans in a taco basket.</li><li>I did n't order but we had the General Tao Chicken, black pepper sizzling beef and some noodle dish with pork and shrimps.</li><li>We typically order spicy pork chops, turnip patties, fish maw with crab meat soup, congee with pork and preserved egg, and some kind of noodle dish.</li><li>They had a lot of pork on the menu.</li><li>The sticky rice with shredded pork is a great appetizer and the snow pea leaves are fresh and green If carbs are your thing the fried noodles and pan fried noodles dishes are big.</li><li>It could have been hotter, but tasted nice and had a good amount of pork and noodle.</li><li>A couple years back I guess due to the relative obscurity of the `` bun bo Hue'' dish, they renamed themselves adding the `` pho'' as that seemed to be the only food non-Vietnamese knew about Vietnamese cuisine Let 's get to the food: bun bo Hue is a vermicelli dish, with beef shank, pork, lemongrass and lots of other herbs.</li><li>Bun Bo Hue is actually the name of a noodle dish- a spicy noodle dish made of beef, pork and vermicelli.</li><li>Ordered the Jajang Myun, pork and squid in hot sauce and bibimbap.</li><li>Everything tastes pretty great especially the pork and squid thing and the portions are pretty massive.</li><li>The broth was a bit on the salty side, but other wise perfect, with large pieces of meltingly soft tofu as well as seafood and pork.</li><li>Try: Pork Bone Soup Very decent Korean restaurant.</li><li>But can they make pork bone soup ?</li><li>After we finish the plate of romain we still have 10 piece of pork belly so we ask for one more romain.</li><li>However, the regular one made with chicken and pork was perfect for Chinese tastes.</li><li>Okay, it 's not Peking Duck quality, and the birds are not serialized from birth to keep track of quality, and there are certainly no time wasted on decorum, but for a local BBQ place where one can purchase a duck, half a duck, chicken, BBQ pork, duck liver, sausages, tofu, and a simple rice takeaway, there are no competition within a 3km radius.</li><li>My family only eats their BBQ pork and would not eat anywhere else.</li><li>I 'm not as much a fan of He He Long 's duck nor their crispy roast pork ( see my other reviews for THE BEST roast pork anywhere) but I do love their char siu pork!</li><li>I 'm not as much a fan of He He Long 's duck nor their crispy roast pork ( see my other reviews for THE BEST roast pork anywhere) but I do love their char siu pork!</li><li>Extra lean pork is drier and has less flavour than the `` half fat'' portions of the pig.</li><li>It seems that white folks demand the lean so often that I typically have to repeat my request for the `` half fat'' pork several times before I am believed:) This is one of my very favorite places to get bbq pork anywhere in the city, and it is just a super-tiny take-out-only joint, but I have yet to be disappointed.</li><li>Sauce is delicious and the flavour of the pork is just right.</li><li>In addition to the roasted pork, duck, soya sauce chicken and BBQ pork they also have the various cooked intestines, soya sauce chicken leg, chicken wings, the squid, some sort of sausage, salted free run chicken and a lot of other items.</li><li>It 's true what another Yelper mentioned, if you ask for a lean piece of pork it 's usually very dry.</li><li>I was really craving some BBQ pork and chicken.</li><li>I chose well today- the glaze on the pork was good ( not too sweet) and I chose a lean piece which had loads of flavour.</li><li>Chicken was ok- pork is better.</li><li>I thought it had some of the better BBQ pork I 've tasted.</li><li>I came in today and asked for the most tender BBQ pork they could give me, because I just had my wisdom teeth removed and I ca n't really chew yet.</li><li>When my pork was being cut, I could see the meat almost melting beneath the weight of the cleaver because it was so moist and tender.</li><li>If you 're coming here to grab a hot meal- you should be here for the Cevappi, which are a ground meat sausages made with veal, lamb and pork.</li><li>He ordered Singapore Noodles and was expecting the usual fried curry noodles with shrimp, pork, and chicken and instead got a soupy concoction with shrimp.</li><li>The Jerk chicken is quite good as well, but not as good as the pork and can be slightly dry depending on the day.</li><li>Jerk pork is very flavourful, not overly salty, and most importantly not dry.</li><li>I love the rice and peas that sit underneath the pork, and its topped with some cabbage and carrot slaw.</li><li>Another time I went there and got a lb of pork and the food was COLD.</li><li>Great pork.</li><li>Their jerk chicken and pork are the best.</li><li>Jerk chicken here can be a bit dry so opting with the pork is the ideal plan here.</li><li>The pork has this wonderful little bark too which I love about the meat.</li><li>My pork was on the lean side.</li><li>Do 's: Sesame lamb, lamb stuffed pan fried buns, beef lung or tripe, lamb soup Do n't: come here expecting pork!</li><li>This restaurant is traditional Chinese except they do not serve pork but do have a large selection of lamb dishes.</li><li>I order katsu don the pork tasted old and expired.</li><li>We made it very clear that as a dietary restriction, I do not eat pork and asked for the bacon and sausages to be substituted for turkey bacon.</li><li>I am always craving the bbq pork on vermicelli.</li><li>The salad rolls are pretty standard, but they have been upgraded recently to include more spring onion and pork ( used to only be shrimp).</li><li>You are the congee queen, young chow rice, and chow mien Congee queen, feel the meat from the spicy pork and bean You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the congee queen ------------- After a night out with my dancing queens, this queen is a classic Congee restaurant, where a group of us ordered one plate of food each to share, where not only we had enough to take home but it cost us $ 10 each.</li><li>I usually start off with a bowl of shredded pork and preserved egg congee with a bit of pepper or chili oil and the fried donut to dip.</li><li>Expertly prepared Cantonese food, including congee, noodles of all sorts and Popular dishes including fried squids, bbq pork and duck.</li><li>We ordered:- fried chili turnip cake -- strong garlic flavors but super tasty- pork and thousand year old egg congee -- super fast service; delicious comfort food- assorted BBQ meats ( honey roasted BBQ pork, roast duck, and roast pig) -- AMAZING!</li><li>I 'm a fan of the baby bok choi with garlic, the crispy pork, and the lemon chicken.</li><li>The Chef Special Fried Rice with Scallop, Shrimp, BBQ pork and Preserved Sausage has its specialty but has different ingredients than the other restaurant if you do not read the description in English and order it under the Chinese name.</li><li>We ordered the two-meat combo, and we had the choice of any two pork, chicken, or duck.</li><li>We had dried oyster, vegetable and lean pork congee ( CAD $ 5.25), fish congee ( CAD $ 4.99), roasted duck and BBQ pork with honey combo ( CAD $ 9.75), Chu-Hau beef brisket ( CAD $ 4.95), stir-fried sticky rice ( CAD $ 5.99), deep-fried crab claws ( CAD $ 5.75), deep-fried shrimp wontons ( CAD $ 5.25), and my be-loved deep-fried sweet cruller ( CAD $ 1.60).</li><li>We had to ask for an additional table to keep the kid from grabbing the BBQ pork ( though who could blame him, pork is delicious!).</li><li>Next we were tantalized by the infamous turnip chili patties, which are like a sexed-up Sino-fied version of homefries and the final tease for Abbas was the chili pork ( you see pork is to Abbas, what Magic Mike is to Sara, deeelightful!)</li><li>Disgusting bits of rubbery pork that was probably alive last century.</li><li>The pork was NOT BBQ.</li><li>BBQ pork on fried rice and spicy fried turnip is always a great choice!</li><li>The green beans with pork, olive and dried fish is fantastic.</li><li>The barbecued duck and pork is made with some kind of hint of anise.</li><li>Cantonese chow mein, turnip patties, fried squid, house congee, general tao 's chicken, snow pea leaf, gai lan/Chinese broccoli, beef and broccoli, roast pork, BBQ duck, fish maw soup, hot and sour soup, soft-shell crab fried rice, eel fried rice ...</li><li>Recommendations: Salt + Pepper Fish- their salt and pepper seasoning is like crack, it 's so good Congee ( that 's a given, it 's named Congee Queen) Any of their bbq meats are good ( ex: Roasted pork) Wonton Noodles in Soup Hot Pot Rice ( takes a while to come out though, about 20 min after the order) Crispy Catonese Chow Mein Dough Fritter Rice Noodle Roll.</li><li>Sausage &amp; minced pork rice with egg: rice was way over cooked, mince pork tasted nothing but soy sauce, egg was burnt on one side, vegetable look and tasted like left over from 2 days ago coming straight out of fridge.</li><li>The starch on the pork were very uneven, some pieces have more starch than pork.</li><li>I would admit that they gave a generous amount of pork, cabbage and noodles.</li><li>I enjoyed the noodles, they were not soggy but very tender however, the pork ...</li><li>It definitely looked odd and it did n't taste exactly like pure pork ...</li><li>Tonight was minced pork and sausage rice along with a grape green tea bbtea.</li><li>I like the food here, especially the chicken cutlet ( tender &amp; tasty), the deep fried fish ( generous portion and never fishy ... you know what I mean!) and the Taiwanese sausage ( can be ordered on it 's own or comes with the minced pork on rice with tea egg.)</li><li>This is a place to go for those who want it and also want All you can eat. the RIbs were good and a high point, as well as the spicy pork.</li><li>For about $ 28 after tip and taxes on a Friday, you get mounds and mounds of Kalbi ribs, bulgogi beef, pork, and other variations of Korean meats.</li><li>While my fellow diners, all go for the Bibimbap, I prefer either the Pork Bone Soup or the Yuk Gae Jjang for my lunch.</li><li>They have pork, beef, chicken, short ribs, and pork belly marinated in Korean BBQ Marinade.</li><li>The pork and chicken were good but were cut a bit thicker than normal which made cooking times so long.</li><li>We also had soon tofu, pork bone soup and bulgogi.</li><li>Bulgogee House is the only AYCE place in the area where you can order something other than pork belly or bulgogi.</li><li>Of course, if you do n't want AYCE, you can order many regular a la carte dishes like pork bone soup or bibimbap.</li><li>We had 6 choices: pork belly, beef short ribs ( kalbi), chicken, spicy pork, pork and bulgogi.</li><li>We had 6 choices: pork belly, beef short ribs ( kalbi), chicken, spicy pork, pork and bulgogi.</li><li>We shared pork wonton and I got pork bone with clear broth soup and rice.</li><li>I ordered pork bone soup and 10 mins later I was told they ran out of rice and no substitute allowed.</li><li>We had to order a Gam Ja Tang because we were still so hungry, and furthermore, it was the saddest Gam Ja Tang I 've ever seen, with only 2/3 of the bowl filled up ( compared to the overflowing bowl you get at Owl), two small pieces of pork bone, and no potatoes or soup fillers.</li><li>I do n't order anything but beef, so I ca n't speak for how good the pork or chicken is.</li><li>I had the pork bone base and the pork bone meat itself was actually really good.</li><li>The beef and pork were chopped and cubed, and tasted average.</li><li>I ordered the Chishan Mian and while I really liked the texture of the noodles, the soup base was just alright but there was barely any pork in the soup, which was quite disappointing.</li><li>The pork is marinated to perfection, not to saucy or salty.</li><li>The pork was juicy and the dense bread soaked up the pork grease/juice.</li><li>The pork was juicy and the dense bread soaked up the pork grease/juice.</li><li>The pork inside was also very tender and juicy, and together with the bread it was perfect.</li><li>Potato Jia Mao tastes good, the pork one was too greasy for my taste.</li><li>It has many more menu options than I expected- we opted for the `` pork jia-mo'' and a `` soy beef stew noodle''.</li><li>But the pork was so juicy it was dripping on to my fingers and it was worth the wait.</li><li>We had the spicy tofu with pork and rice and some steam buns.</li><li>We ordered several plates of dumplings, sadly most of them were pork ( my cousin ordered not realizing that my sister does n't eat pork or beef).</li><li>I also did n't care for the sesame biscuit with egg and dried pork.</li><li>It was topped with a sauce of minced pork and preserved vegetable.</li><li>Ordered: Porkbelly BBQ ( Sam Kyup Sal)* Pork belly BBQ served with mushrooms, onions and veggies for wrapping* You cook this on a BBQ grill at your table* Served with green onions and you can add it to your ' ssam' Green onions with chili powder and some vinegar for you to eat with the grilled meat Ordered: Marinated Beef ( Ju Mul Luk)* Beef mixed with veggies in a sweet sauce* I much prefer this over Bulgogi which I find it to be too sweet* This you also cook at your table with the grill Ordered: Kimchi Stew ( KimChi JjiGae)* It was interesting to see vermicelli in a Kimchi stew* The soup was just spicy enough and not too sour* Usually you eat this with a bowl of rice Ordered: Dumplings ( Mandoo)* These were Mul-Mandoo which means it is cooked in boiling water* You dip this into soy sauce Ordered: Spicy Soup ( Jjam Ppong Tang)* This is usually a noodle dish but this specific one was made without for drinking* It makes a nice dish to order when you are drinking soju* Filled with seafood and veggies Ordered: Seafood Pancake ( Hae Mul Pa Jeon)* There was n't much seafood in the pancake* I did n't really enjoy this Ordered: Spicy octopus &amp; pork* This is a table top cooking with veggies, octopus and pork* You can adjust the spiciness of this dish* Usually comes in 2 portions but we added an extra serving* Because there was so much food it did take a while to cook Conclusion: Now that I 've been back 3 times and tried couple things off their menu, I am convinced that even from their never-ending menu- they serve good Korean food.</li><li>Ordered: Porkbelly BBQ ( Sam Kyup Sal)* Pork belly BBQ served with mushrooms, onions and veggies for wrapping*

know what it was really supposed to actually taste like, but it was strips of pork in a bowl of grease ( not your `` greasy goodness'' ... it was literally a bowl of oil) with a sauce that seems reminiscent to Kraft BBQ sauce.</li><li>The kimchi chigae ( stew with tofu, pork, and kimchi) was a big letdown.</li><li>Got the pork one soup hoppy.</li><li>Love their kam ja tang as the pork is tender and it literally comes right off ..</li><li>The second time around, my guest and I had 10 banchans with our pork bone soup and white fish stew.</li><li>And my Yelp Friend ordered: Budae jjigae- A huge hot pot of hot dogs, pork, ham, veggie, instant ramen and even a Kraft cheese- I felt like I am back in my University years that I would just throw anything in some spicy broth and start eating, the good old days ...</li><li>I opted for the spicy pork ( $ 14), which was alright, but it 's literally a big plate of pork and a bowl of rice, so in terms of a balanced meal with vegetables, it 's lacking.</li><li>I opted for the spicy pork ( $ 14), which was alright, but it 's literally a big plate of pork and a bowl of rice, so in terms of a balanced meal with vegetables, it 's

soup.</li><li>I ordered the Pork Bulgogi Ddukbaegi ( marinated pork in sweet &amp; spicy soup cooked in a hot stone pot).</li><li>The pork was really crispy, but I would have enjoyed it more if they went easier on the brown sauce.</li><li>A spicy beef, fried rice with pork in an clay pot ?</li><li>The green beans with pork was excellent and so was the bok choy with oyster mushrooms and tofu.</li><li>Fav dishes: aforementioned Yaka Mein, steamed pork, sesame/butterfly shrimp, lobster sauce ( order it as a side without the shrimp to save a bit of $ $), Chinese sausage fried rice.</li><li>I had the wonton soup which had a few nice hunks of pork in it- and then followed up with a beef lo-mein.</li><li>They use the part of the pork that make soups.</li><li>Maybe I did n't like it that much because I was just too full and had just finished a pork bone soup at Lim Ga Ne but I do n't think this is the case.</li><li>A bowl of vermicelli with grilled pork, wonton soup and tea for $ 4.50- tax included.</li><li>Previously they did n't have pork in their menu at all ... which I found very odd because a lot of Filipino food consist of pork.</li><li>Previously they did n't have pork in their menu at all ... which I found very odd because a lot of Filipino food consist of pork.</li><li>It was quite good, but I would definitely recommend adding mayo in that sisig for extra yumminess ( that 's how we make our pork sisig at home and trust me ... the flavours are bolder).</li><li>They also have different variations of Soontofu/Soondubu- kimchi, seafood and I believe pork.</li><li>Ordered #3 with beef, pork, tofu spicy kimchi.</li><li>I ordered the pork and tofu jigae and the dishes came out under 10 minutes.</li><li>I opted for the kimchi soon tofu with beef and pork, regular spicy.</li><li>Nonetheless, I was willing to try something different so I ordered Kimchi Soon Tofu + Dolsotbab ( kimchi, beef, pork).</li><li>The kimchi tofu was awesome with the mix of beef, pork and kimchi and I got it regular spicy which had just enough kick.</li><li>My partner had the beef dumpling soon tofu which was the only item he could have since he has to avoid any type of shellfish, pork or mushrooms ... probably wo n't be returning because of this ...</li><li>Ordered the pork Katsu arrived with hard pork no rice or salad.</li><li>Ordered the pork Katsu arrived with hard pork no rice or salad.</li><li>Then you pick your meat ( chicken, beef, pulled pork, pulled beef, fish and shrimp) and toppings ( four salsas, cheese, beans, sour cream, lettuce).</li><li>Tasty pork filling.</li><li>The choice of protein is standard with chicken, steak, pork, fish, and shrimp.</li><li>The pork was juicy and the rice had a good flavor.</li><li>I could just eat pork bone soup everyday of the week if I lived close by ...</li><li>The soup is quiet large, there is a massive pork bone bathing in pork broth.</li><li>There are many better options for pork bone soup in Toronto.</li><li>Perhaps the name is appropriate after all, as deciding on a meal of hearty Pork Bone Soup with a nice beer, can at times, be a wise choice indeed ....</li><li>The pork was really flavorful, served with a generous amount of vegetables ( green peppers and onions).</li><li>The pork bone soup comes in a large table-stove, and come with about 6 pieces of pork bone, varying sizes.</li><li>Sing karaoke, drink soju and eat pork bone soup =) Their crispy deep fried sweet &amp; sour pork with apples was yummy as well .. no idea how they got it so darn

here even if you prefer other Korean dishes over Pork Bone Soup.</li><li>The pork is soft and tasty.</li><li>I placed an order for pork bone soup for takeout ( not the first time I 've ordered this either in store or take home).</li><li>I 've had a few of their menu items including the famous Pork Bone Soup and everything is reliably good.</li><li>My lovely dining companion had a hankering for pork bone soup and she seemed to get a massive and tasty bowl.</li><li>I also recommend any pork dish, since their pork is light yet flavorful.</li><li>The curry was good besides the fatty pork and awful potatoes.</li><li>They never gave me knife for bbq pork and chicken, which bothers me a little.</li><li>We ordered the braise pork balls and when we sliced the ball in half, the PORK WAS RAW.</li><li>This is 2012 and serving raw pork, where is the quality control ?</li><li>We ordered the usual staple chinese foods such as sweet and sour pork, fried rice, veggie dishes, and a variety of other dishes that all tasted fresh.</li><li>Initially wanting to just go with something light- somehow we ordered crab tofu, Shanghainese seafood noodle, beef pancake rolls, fried whole fish in brown sauce, garlic stir fried string beans, appetizer platter sampler ( drunken chicken, jellyfish, and pork ?) and two orders of crab meat soup dumplings ( yep too much food for the 5 of us).</li><li>They do n't use pork belly, it 's shredded pork meat.</li><li>I can taste the pork stock in the gelatin and a hint of star anise.</li><li>Soup dumpling with scallops and pork $ 6.99- its $ 1 more than the standard pork soup dumpling and honestly I could not tell the difference.</li><li>I would stay away from the Westernized dishes ( e.g. beef w/ broccoli, sweat &amp; sour pork, etc.) as I have n't found them to be any good.</li><li>Do n't try other dishes like stirring fried vermicelli ( poor portion and bland, for all the Cantonese dishes, I recommend congee Wong nearby) or traditional Chinese dishes like fish flavoured pork slices ( 鱼香肉丝 ）, sweat &amp; sour fish is a big joke ... check out my photos--it 's even a joke for the Westerners, okay ?</li><li>This dish is a mixture of rice cakes, cabbage and small strips of pork.</li><li>Lots of flavour, no lack of pork or bones, and good amount of thoroughly cooked potato.</li><li>The Pork Bone Soup came out FAST and the portion size I 'm quite happy about.</li><li>I especially like their pork bone soup and broiled mackerel!</li><li>The portion of pork was big with about 3-4 mammoth sized bones full of meat.</li><li>I really like their Pork Bone Soup because it is spicy which is my favorite taste.</li><li>I 've had their pork bone soup and it was delicious.</li><li>The menu says they have chicken, pork or beef bibimbap but that 's a lie.</li><li>It was not flavoured as well as the pork bone one, and if I was n't hungry after the waiting time I would deem it as bland.</li><li>I love how the spice is JUST right, and the bowl is big enough for all the pork- unlike some places that have it overflowing.</li><li>The pork could 've been a bit more fatty to give it better flavour as it was relatively lean.</li><li>It was a little on the dry side but I think it was because the pork had no fat in it.</li><li>-Siu Mai is very good- Any of the BBQ pork or chicken buns have good filling.</li><li>We had green bean and pork; steamed pork and salty egg yolk; garlic bok choy; beef stew; roasted garlic chicken; fish with bamboo and sugar snap, taro duck and sweet and sour pork.</li><li>My favourite is the Tosilog ( cured pork, fried egg, and veggies) and the Filipino style spaghetti.</li><li>Not to mention the food, which was amazing, had the Cuban sandwich, which was a ton of delicious pork on a soft ciabatta roll.</li><li>It looked more like a small hunk of pork, coated in sauce, that someone had stabbed with a fork a few times ... also, it was n't hot, it was room temperature Overall we got decent quantity but not fantastic quality.</li><li>The platter was about 35 $ and came with wings, ribs, shortribs, pulled pork, fries, cornbread, baked beans and coleslaw.</li><li>Pulled pork was bland, dry and smokeless.</li><li>Pulled pork tastes lik ... pulled pork.</li><li>Pulled pork tastes lik ... pulled pork.</li><li>Beer makes me happy. this was ok --- SUMMARY --- Plus 's: good place to hang out, decent food, Minus 's: sitting on the patio means breathing all the car exhaust from the cars on Yonge street --- MORE DETAILS --- we choose a platter for two ... it consisted of: very tender chicken ( i picked it up and a piece of meat fell off- SO TENDER) first time i had cornbread- it looked burnt on the bottom, so i just ate the top part not bad ( it would n't ' be my first choice) pulled pork was ok chicken wings were fairly good beef brisket was pretty good .. ribs were kinda dry ... in the end everything kinda tasted the same. fries were good- not too salty. stepping in, the restaurant itself is nice, there are booths or table seating indoors. the main window is a garage front that opens into the patio area facing yonge st. interior has exposed beam ceilings and there 's many nostalgic memorabilia decorated throughout. we ordered a couple of things from the menu 1. spaghetti with beef brisket- yeah i know an experimental dish but i was feeling like spaghetti and if the brisket was good -- you know that would been amazing. unfortunately the brisket was covered in tomato sauce so I could n't taste it in it 's full glory or not ..</li><li>But the pork was not smoked. this place did n't deliver the goods unfortunately.</li><li>Pulled pork was also cold saugy and fatty.</li><li>If you are not a big fan of pork, try their grilled Mackerel.</li><li>Grilled Sliced Beef dinner set with a choice of soup ( we picked Pork Bone) ( $ 45) is A-OK.</li><li>Ordered a whole bunch of food to share including: 1) Pork Bone Soup- $ 9.99 2) Samgyeopsal- BBQ Bacon and soup ( for 2 ppl)- $ 32.99 3) &amp; 4) Bibimbap- $ ?? 5) Side dishes- Free 1) Pork bone soup is really good, the consistency of the soup is slightly thicker than what you would get from any other place.</li><li>They bring a grill to your table and a whole plate of fatty pork ( uncured bacon).</li><li>Soup #2 was a kimchi tofu soup of sorts, with pieces of pork in it.</li><li>Usually pan fried dumplings should made with pork and I am not a big big fan of Chicken.</li><li>We ordered 4 dishes, the special sweet and sour pork, beef with vegetables, chicken with vegetables, and mushrooms with vegetables.</li><li>A meal for about $ 15.00 will include a platter so salmon sushi and California rolls, salad, miso soup, tempura, teriyaki steak, grilled pork and the list goes on.</li><li>As I do n't eat pork I love the Turkey Bacon option.</li><li>We irdered a mix of table and a la carte Table cooking Fresh beef ( looks and price loke wagu) $ 31 very small portion and not work the price Short ribs good but pricey at $ 30 Special Sliced pork belly $ 20 very good but I usually order the regular pork $ 17 ( best bet) A la carte Ka ja tang solid Bi bum bap good The side are a little better then the other korean place around and found the Noodle side dish with seasame oil excellent but they do offer free refill on that dish.</li><li>Unbelievable I 've been coming here all the time and they just told me that they will charge me extra for all you can eat pork belly for the salad which was our first one and said there 's a new rule if your not into serving customers all you can eat do n't offer it honestly I 've been here all the time learn how to treat your regulars certainly never coming back here.</li><li>I assumed she 'd bring pork but she came with some small pieces of bulgogi looking meat.</li><li>We did wait a long time for our dishes though, especially the pork and rice cakes.</li><li>The pork was crispy and tender.</li><li>Their

serving and insisted that because we were 4 people we needed to order at least 2 bbq servings otherwise we could n't eat here, so we left.)</li><li>She brought one out and my cousin asked for another box as she wanted to take the pork home since she did n't eat it and only drank the soup.</li><li>She insisted to get a soup container for the pork but I explained that there is no soup we just want to take the meat.</li><li>When I finally flagged down the server, after several attempts of pressing the button and waving her down, I asked her if we could get some bowls to put our pork bone in.</li><li>Pick your meat ( pork, lamb, beef, chicken or several different kinds of seafood), veggies ( plenty of options), noodles ( 3 varieties) and sauce ( large selection of pre-mixed or create your own) and hand your bowl to the cook who has it ready for you in a minute or so after tossing it around on a huge hot plate with no oil, just water.</li><li>The novelty with the Mongolian Grill is

stand outs include the salt and pepper squid, cantonese chow mein and the shredded pork &amp; preserved duck egg congee.</li><li>We decided to order the supreme super bowl congee, cantonese chow mein, three kinds stuffed vegetables ( eggplant, tofu and green pepper), minced pork and dried fish green beans and fried chili turnip patties.</li><li>If not this, then the lean pork with the thousand year

dishes: Scrambled egg &amp; shrimp, wonton lo mein, yeung chow fried rice, peking style pork &amp; crispy chicken.</li><li>For example, I just had the congee with pork and preserved egg.</li><li>It
