<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 24' %><h2>Lunch<br />occurrence: 323</h2><div><ol><li>My Lunch buddy has this thing for soup ... but she just could n't decide which one to go with since there are 3 choices for `` Soup of the Day'' ...</li><li>Soly 's is an ok place for a quick lunch.</li><li>For lunch I usually have Salmon with steamed mushrooms and veggies.</li><li>Lunch will usually cost an average of $ 10 or more but this place is usually always consistent!</li><li>It was more than edible but less than enjoyable ... all in all an ok lunch for under $ 10.</li><li>I used to LOVE going here, however today went to have lunch at the restaurant with coworkers and noticed that there was a bird flying over everyone while they were eating.</li><li>I 've only gone during lunch, which is pretty quiet ( we 're usually the only table), but that is better for us because the food is super fresh ..</li><li>Went with a group from work for lunch.</li><li>Great bento lunch and dinner choices at a very reasonable price!</li><li>There is a time and a place for when I want to spend more and get higher quality, but for a friday lunch, I will choose Sakura over many other places.</li><li>IMHO, use only for lunch at your own discretion.</li><li>I 've visited ' The Sugar' four times over the past few years, most recently today for lunch.</li><li>I have been to The Sugar for dessert and dinner ( separately) in the late evening, for lunch on a weekend.</li><li>I would definitely like to visit Tuyen again for lunch or dinner on my next trip to Toronto.</li><li>Will go again for a lunch.</li><li>Had a great lunch.</li><li>We also ordered the lunch `` Winterlicious'' menu.</li><li>I came here on a lunch break to do some stuff on my laptop.</li><li>I was pleasantly surprised by its quality when we stopped by for a quick lunch.</li><li>The Sashimi Haru was a boat of sashimi that must 've been sitting since atleast lunch.</li><li>Decent price ( $ 15 AYCE lunch).</li><li>I have n't been a huge fan of South St. Burgers but I come here on occasion for a quick bite to eat for lunch.</li><li>I had the lunch sushi and sashimi special and I thought it was great- all the pieces were fresh and proportions were big enough to fill me up for lunch.</li><li>The restaurant felt more like a bar than a sushi restaurant, which made me feel a bit out of place ( everyone eating lunch here was wearing business attire; I had a backpack with me damnit!</li><li>For lunch I ordered the Sushi Lunch 11.</li><li>I used to come here quite often as I worked in the area, and the lunch sets are really good and good portion size.</li><li>One time they forgot the water and I had to ask someone else so that 's why I give it 4/5 but other than that good place! we stopped by for lunch today. the decor looked fancy, i like the environment. the price tag is a bit on the expensive side. you 're looking at 20-30 dollars easy per person. i do like their quality of food. we had some salmon and tuna nigiris and they were pretty fresh! the staff there are attentive. cute place! although this place was suggested by my cousin ( because his friend owns the place), i was unimpressed by their sushi/sashimi. it was n't fresh! yes, the place is nice, trendy and huge, but i would n't go here for their sushi.</li><li>I 've had lunch, dinner, and after work drinks.</li><li>Had this 8 dollar lunch bulgiogi bento and it was super delicious.</li><li>I 've been to this place several times now ( for both lunch and dinner).</li><li>I came to Sushi Moto at least three times during the summer as I was interning in the area and occasionally dropped by for lunch.</li><li>I went here last Friday with a friend for lunch.</li><li>You can enjoy a good lunch or dinner here with friends or family.</li><li>When I come for lunch, I usually get the lunch buffet because their food selection is really tasty.</li><li>I 'll admit the place is a bit pricey for a lunch -- Usually ends up being $ 35-40 per person, with no booze- But if you can write it off as a business expense, I encourage you to do so.</li><li>Not too bad for a lunch.</li><li>If you come for breakfast you get the same gargantuan portions you get for lunch or dinner.</li><li>Lunch is busy during the week days.</li><li>The house special for lunch `` soup and sandwich'' $ 6.99 best deal in the area.</li><li>Decent selection of breakfast, lunch, dinner options.</li><li>Came here with a friend on a Thursday for lunch.</li><li>Also if you are in a rush call ahead of time to the avoid the line up around lunch.</li><li>Honestly, this place is good for a quick lunch or dinner but it is not a place where one can actually relax and eat a full meal.</li><li>Cora supposed to offer a fabulous breakfast and lunch.</li><li>The line was long during lunch hour, and the counter where they cook and prepare the shawarmas is pretty much right near the entrance door, which makes it a bit of an inconvenience in terms of the line/getting in and out.</li><li>Good prices for a quick and tasty lunch.</li><li>I like their daily specials:) it 's a good place to grab a quick bite to eat whether it be lunch or late night!</li><li>I see myself coming back here, for casual lunch in the dinning area, sitting by the window and watch people walk on Yonge.</li><li>When six people go for lunch and all agree that the quality of the food has gone down hill to the point you would not go back if it were free, you know its bad. food okay but inconsistent in quality. sauces taste store bought. veggie spring rolls very bland.</li><li>Both times I tried their All You Can Eat option, once for lunch and once for dinner.</li><li>I could see that they have the best intentions and are trying their best to please customers, but I believe its the lack of solid management that caused everyone to scramble with service, cooking, and ultimately poor customer experiences. mmmm not my best brunch/breakfast for lunch experience. they just opened few weeks ago right next to our office so we went there for lunch.</li><li>Stacey, my colleague, also likes their rotis so we 've been trying to figure out how to get there for lunch.</li><li>She and I had a meeting this afternoon in Concord and she suggested that we have lunch along the way at Island Foods at their Don Mills Road location.</li><li>Whenever I travel to Toronto for work, I wind up having lunch here.</li><li>Decided to check out their menu and tried them out for lunch.</li><li>Overall I would recommend them for a quick and cheap lunch, especially if you 're not watching your cholesterol levels.</li><li>There are 2 dishes I would recommend, 1. lunch special C, the vermicelli and beef skewers with a spring roll for $ 7.75 and/or 2. lunch special B, the lemongrass porkchop on rice ( it also includes a hot/sour soup) for $ 7.50.</li><li>I 'd go back for a cheap, quick lunch but do n't think it 's like what you 'd get on the Danforth.</li><li>I 've been for dinner and lunch.</li><li>Lunch is about $ 20-30 and Dinner is more like $ 40-50 per person.</li><li>I 've never dined inside this location, the patio lunch was pretty much my first experience here ever.</li><li>Not cheap for lunch.</li><li>Everything else like the sushi, sashimi, chicken terriyaki were terrible in my bento box I had for lunch they did n't look or taste fresh.</li><li>We 're trying to have lunch, talk, and catch up.</li><li>Since I do n't like making single-purpose trips, we decided to have lunch here and try a restaurant that was exclusive to this area.</li><li>Had lunch here yesterday ( Aug 26/14).</li><li>We waited 25 minutes for our lunch to be delivered &amp; the restaurant was n't even busy.</li><li>I have only been for lunch.</li><li>They were not busy at all for a weekday lunch.</li><li>Our office is on Yong St north of Finch in City of Toronto and at least 12 times in any year we have either dinner or lunch at your restaurant at 5000 Yonge St Last Wednesday ( June 10th) my assistant made a reservation for 5.</li><li>Tried Lunch today great service and great flavorful foid Haleem tasted perfect for kids, medium spicy 2 haleem, 1 charga, a doz kabob, 10 naan, 2 lassi, 4 drinks cost around $ 110 not including tips, its pricy for 4 kids and 4 adults but if u can afford worth eating. awful customer service experience.</li><li>Or a lunch.</li><li>A great place for families, groups or to meet a friend for lunch or dinner.</li><li>I bet lunch should be lot more busier than dinner.</li><li>Usually fairly quiet at lunch during the week so a good choice for a business lunch.</li><li>I have had some moments when I was given the wrong fish, had to get my lunch to go because it took the food a long time to arrive and I 'm not crazy about the fact they stuff with spicy handrolls with loads of crunchy bits that quickly go soggy.</li><li>Not spectacular but a place I go to for a quick lunch.</li><li>Quick lunch with my friend.</li><li>Colleagues and I came here for lunch.</li><li>I do n't know if they are cutting corners or there was a rush at lunch but I am serious ly going to think again when I am hungry for lunch.</li><li>Why would the person serving lunch be eating lunch and the dining room is a mess ... ?</li><li>Came at lunch.</li><li>It seems that their main clients are surrounding businesses mostly for lunch.</li><li>The retail items for lunch or dinner tend to be terribly over-salted most of the time.</li><li>The lunch and dinner scenes vastly differ, and once dinner rolls around, you can hardly recognize the place.</li><li>During lunch, they also have a take-out area, so people who work in or around the area can pick up lunch.</li><li>We smoked up before eating and we still could n't finish it plus enough for the both of us to take home for lunch.</li><li>I prepared a lunch for myself, but ruined it due to a faulty pepper shaker.</li><li>Small bowl usually does the trick for lunch.</li><li>Super fast service, great for a quick lunch.</li><li>The lunch is a great combo ... good &amp; cheap.</li><li>I went here today for the first time after reading reviews at around 2pm for a late lunch.</li><li>$ 14 for lunch during the week, 15 Friday through Sunday and holidays.</li><li>Although the lunch buffet price is half of dinner and there seemed to be over 75 + items listed, nothing but the dinner only items stood out ( no sashimi for lunch), I personally would n't make my money worth by coming here for lunch.</li><li>Although the lunch buffet price is half of dinner and there seemed to be over 75 + items listed, nothing but the dinner only items stood out ( no sashimi for lunch), I personally would n't make my money worth by coming here for lunch.</li><li>Went for lunch.</li><li>If I 'm coming back again, it would be for dinner because there is no sashimi for lunch.</li><li>Lunch and dinner menu are great variety.</li><li>Since I love sushi, especially AYCE, my friend brought me here for lunch.</li><li>I was living super close by when it first opened and I remember when AYCE was $ 14 at lunch ...</li><li>The price was n't bad for the amount of food you get during lunch.</li><li>I came for lunch with three others and although they had a decent variety, the quality was lacking.</li><li>Lunch ends 4:30pm and is 15.95 mon-thurs, 16.95 fri-sun.</li><li>The place looks fairly nice and the prices are pretty good for lunch.</li><li>The manager offered us a 10% discount which is a joke and I kindly commented on how we are still midway on our lunch.</li><li>The way they brought it was ridiculous, tiny portions at a time, so the lunch we had took about twice as long as it should have.</li><li>Expensive for AYCE lunch.</li><li>Also note they offer a buffet for around 9-11 $ for lunch.</li><li>I had the standard ' two can dine for $ 9.48' coupons ( oh how I would gladly pay the extra penny just to have it rhyme again!) so I headed off to the Sheppard Centre with a coworker for lunch!</li><li>Some colleagues and I suggested to go get some Pho for an early lunch.</li><li>Overall, very impressed with the setup and it 's a great option for a quick relatively healthy fresh lunch! + good bread- pricey pricey pricey This cafe is located within the factory building.</li><li>It 's a bit out of the way but if you are up in the Lawrence &amp; Keele area it 's a great place to stop for lunch.</li><li>Our office used to be located within walking distance of this restaurant and I would come here all the time for lunch and dinner.</li><li>Every time I go to do my weekly groceries at Loblaws ( Empress Walk), I stop by this place to have lunch.</li><li>Scrumptious food, nice manager, cute children, free wifi, food comes with drinks during lunch, lots of outlets to charge tablets and phones, very considerate restaurant!</li><li>Did n't end up spending more than $ 7-8 for lunch got almost half a pizza with a pop. Ca n't beat that.</li><li>I 'd go back there for lunch in a heartbeat.</li><li>We were intending to go someplace else for lunch but the kids feel asleep in the car so takeout it was!</li><li>I was dropping off my snowboard at the nearby Skiis and Biikes ( a bad experience, see my other review) and decided to go here for lunch.</li><li>A really cheap and satisfying lunch with leftovers to enjoy later.</li><li>I decided to give this place a chance after going to Congee Queen and finding out that it would 30 min wait till I could have lunch.</li><li>But I would most definitely come back here again for lunch if i 'm in the area.</li><li>Came here on Thursday for lunch.</li><li>I 've come here a few times for dinner, lunch and take out.</li><li>The beef udon noodle meal took half an hour to come out as well which on a lunch when you 've only got 45 minutes to eat, is pretty brutal.</li><li>We came here for lunch.</li><li>Came here for lunch.</li><li>I have been here for lunch, afternoon tea and dinner.</li><li>We had lunch and all the dishes were tasty.</li><li>Just went came back from lunch.</li><li>This Ichiban is a great place for lunch or dinner.</li><li>The prices for lunch are much higher than any other Japanese restaurant in the area, without any justification.</li><li>My husband and I came here for lunch.</li><li>Ordered the lobster sashimi special, the unagi Don and sashimi salad, the sashimi salad was somewhat mediocre, lots of vegetables and not too much sashimi, the Unagi Don lunch special was tiny, and lobster sashimi was kind of too moist .. overall an average lunch experience.</li><li>It ai n't the west coast but it 'll do for dinner or lunch; I go here regularly, maybe too regularly. i remember in University we used to come here all the time, because the choices were either this ( and it was n't even that cheap) or sapporo sushi up the street.</li><li>The place is small so seating is a bit limited during the rush times like lunch and dinner.</li><li>Food is okay though not a large restaurant but if u are looking for a small lunch or dinner Thai bistro can be a choice.</li><li>This place opens at noon for lunch.</li><li>Not a good place for a date or to enjoy atmosphere, it is best for take out or a quick lunch.</li><li>Good for casual weekday lunch.</li><li>For lunch they have a buffet but for dinner it is a la carte.</li><li>Came here for lunch!</li><li>This restaurant feels like a neighborhood place for a casual lunch hang out.</li><li>The portion is quite large and I always leave feeling stuffed and/or with a doggie bag of chicken to add to tomorrow 's lunch.</li><li>All in all, this is a great place for lunch.</li><li>Had I known this had only 2.5 stars on Yelp, I would 've passed when a coworker recommended this place for lunch.</li><li>Went to Linda for a very late lunch a few days ago.</li><li>Chicken Lemongrass Pork Siu Mai Crispy Beef Panang ( Gaeng Panang) Deep Fried Milk Pudding All was really solid and especially the main was just the same size as regular $ 13 lunch and here they charging $ 15 for a 3 course.</li><li>Went to Linda 's today for lunch, did n't know winterlicious was on.</li><li>Best dish is the panang curry- Beef panang ( lunch and dinner portions are prepared differently- dinner is crispy), or my favourite, the Thai Islamic Noodles with shrimp and chicken.</li><li>Yesterday a friend met up for lunch at Linda Modern Thai.</li><li>Had a very good lunch experience here.</li><li>Summerlicious lunch on weekends.</li><li>Dining Experience: Lunch

lunch.</li><li>I came here today for lunch with a group of 7 hungry coworkers.</li><li>If I 'm ever in Toronto again, this California girl is coming back to Katz. there pastrami/ corned beef is good, they stack em pretty high and just a lttle dry, cafeteria like, everything is ala carte, i usually get, a big pastrami sandwich on rye, fries and a piece of the rich chocolate cake, a vernors to wash it all down .... gets busy a lunch, plenty of seating, a bit expensive, last time i went $ 9 bucks a sandwich ( around there) ...</li><li>It might help to note that this TRIP was actually for a pre-dinner snack around 4pm so traffic and patrons were limited to a few as it 's neither the lunch or dinner rush that other reviewers have had their experience with.</li><li>I take friends by for a nice lunch, I especially like the tall glasses of un-sweetened Ice Tea.</li><li>For a lunch that cost me 17 dollars, in a canteen style restaurant, and to have attitude given to me over a 5 cent box, you bet I wont be back here.</li><li>Portion wise just perfect without leaving me wanting to have a second lunch!</li><li>I believe it ranges between 14.99 and 18.99 depending on whether it is lunch or dinner and which day of the week it is but do n't quote me on that.</li><li>If you are in the area, I definitely suggest coming here for their lunch !!</li><li>I have dined here twice with a friend, both times for lunch.</li><li>It did n't occur to me that they had a lunch and dinner platter until as of recent and found that the ' small' fillet was really half of the large which really was n't much to begin with.</li><li>This place is located conveniently near my workplace, so I 've come here for lunch a few times and loved it!</li><li>My buddy and I used to come here for lunch when we had extra time.</li><li>Oh yeah, the servings are HUGE, but the leftovers are great for lunch the next day!</li><li>Great for lunch at time. yummmm !! def going back ... awesome hot and sour soup seafood fried rice and everything else ..:).</li><li>This place is great for lunch or dinner.</li><li>Great lunch and breakfast specials ...</li><li>Our party of 6 came here for lunch.</li><li>The overal meal is not impressive but a cheap place to eat for lunch.</li><li>Even when we were there for the weekday lunch, most of the patron 's in the pretty packed restaurant were non-Koreans.</li><li>Two portions for two people for lunch was more than sufficient, and even two portions for three people for dinner plus a side of dumplings was fine too.</li><li>I was pretty satisfied w/ the place and would recommend it for lunch.</li><li>Had lunch on a Wednesday.</li><li>But still a great choice for lunch.</li><li>I have had lunch any times at this restaurant and always enjoyed it.</li><li>I like to come here with my mom on my days off and enjoy a lunch together.</li><li>This plaza gets insanely busy during the lunch rush so I would recommend going right before or after ( 11:30am or 1:00pm) lunch.</li><li>This plaza gets insanely busy during the lunch rush so I would recommend going right before or after ( 11:30am or 1:00pm) lunch.</li><li>I would recommend you

I have probably been here at least half a dozen times for brunch, lunch, and dinner.</li><li>Come here for a casual date, lunch with the kids or by simply by yourself.</li><li>We went during the lunch rush so the place was rather busy but not packed.</li><li>Decent place to have lunch but nothing very unique about it.</li><li>Well, for lunch anyways, since that 's the only time I 've been.</li><li>So .... next time you see the sporadically glowing red neon of the `` Famous'' Sea-Hi Restaurant, why not give it a shot for lunch ?</li><li>Stopped here for take out lunch.</li><li>I use to always went there for shawarma sandwich for lunch.</li><li>I 've been Pastel a few times for dessert but recently tried this place out for lunch.</li><li>Came here with a party of 2 after lunch on a Sunday.</li><li>Everyone enjoyed what they got ( I ca n't recall all the items as most of us had the savoury crepe for lunch and followed it with shared sweet crepes as dessert).</li><li>Our server was delightful .. especially accommodating for a large group of 14 people having sunday lunch.</li><li>Their portions are reasonably sized and price for lunch.</li><li>Stick with the cheap beer for lunch.</li><li>All you can eat for $ 14 lunch.</li><li>Went here for lunch, which is the only time they have AYCE ... come on guys, you know this.</li><li>At just over $ 4 for a slice it 's an convenient choice for a cheap lunch.</li><li>The menu is a bit limited, and the price a bit high, I must admit, but when I need a quick lunch or take-out dinner, it 's a staple.</li><li>I came to have lunch at Takara Bune with no expectations.</li><li>Even with the Groupon it did n't seem worth it &amp; for a sit down dinner we were done in 30 mins ... came here for lunch.</li><li>Additionally, at lunch I 'll be standing and waiting for five minutes after placing my order and I 'll see it get flung down the heater tray and I 'll think `` Hey, at least it 's fresh''.</li><li>Overall the service killed the lunch.</li><li>Good for: lunch.</li><li>We were seated between the lone other occupied table and a loud private room where a large group was finishing what appeared to be a cross between a business meeting and late lunch.</li><li>Was here for lunch.</li><li>Have literally just finished my meal ( lunch).</li><li>Had the sashimi and nigiri sushi combo for lunch.</li><li>Stopping in for a mid afternoon lunch, I had the sushi combo.</li><li>I had a good lunch here.</li><li>Yuki is one of the few affordable restaurants in the area, which is why it was crowded during lunch ( lunch specials till 4).</li><li>Full extra star for the service, and being a decent option for lunch in a neighborhood where you would not expect it.</li><li>I tried this place out for lunch.</li><li>I would n't recommend eating a hot fudge dipped cone on a hot day, while on lunch at work, it can get very messy, very fast!</li><li>Did n't feel crowded for a weekday lunch.</li><li>Excellent local place for breakfast ( or lunch) ... standard as well as eclectic breakfast menu ... comfort-food type lunch menu.</li><li>The breakfast menu is heavy on egg breakfasts, including a wide assortment of

close by to my bank.</li><li>I always get their Spicy Salmon, Tuna Sushi and Salmon Sushi combo for lunch for $ 5.99! ( yes, and that is like 8 pieces of sushi for that price) and sometimes when I feel like splurging a little for lunch, I order their spider roll for like $ 14.99 i think- which is like my favourite maki rolls and this place is generous when it comes to the soft shell crab they stuff in that shit.</li><li>We ended up having lunch here and my oh my how things how changed.</li><li>Casual place- great for lunch.</li><li>Went on a Saturday for lunch.</li><li>Food ( Lunch): Besides the cooking table I have been for lunch service and ate the chicken-bento-box with soup, small salad, 4 sushi rolls, rice and tofu.</li><li>Teppanyaki Ume ( see picture) is a very good full lunch which includes soup, salad, shrimp appetizer, rice, veggies, chicken and steak.</li><li>Memories of Japan feels dated, but it 's still a decent place for lunch.</li><li>Other times I 've been later to the table and the lunch has been very speedy.</li><li>When my office relocated to Don Mills and Eglinton/Lawrence area, I was happy that I was able to once again enjoy the food a little bit more frequently, visiting often to pick up food for lunch, or ordering for delivery when I could not leave the office.</li><li>I found lunch to be quite good.</li><li>I ordered number ' 51' which was a basic lunch at $ 11.</li><li>The nod meant that no one put anything extra in the school 's lunch.</li><li>There were three of us for lunch.</li><li>I popped over to Fit for Life for a quick, light lunch ... right spot for a man on such a mission.</li><li>The food seemed to agree with me though so I 'll probably be back at some point for another quick lunch.</li><li>Some guy eventually showed up and started to put the blame on us saying that he cannot accomodate one client for lunch when everyone else is eating breakfast.</li><li>Other than that, go eat some quality gamjatang here for lunch, dinner, or hell, even 2 am snack!</li><li>Ordered only three items as it was only two people dining for lunch.</li><li>Make sure you mix it all up before eating it and it does have quite a bit of garlic, so I would n't probably order it if you 're dining for lunch on a weekday.</li><li>Came here for lunch.</li><li>That was the question my friend, when I went today for lunch ....</li><li>Pricewise was a little pricey for lunch in my opinion.</li><li>I do believe they use the same menu for lunch and dinner, which would explain the dinner-like price point.</li><li>Mmmm ... lunch was over 4 hours ago and I still ca n't get over how good my wrap was.</li><li>Alas, I could not finish my lunch and had to take it away.</li><li>I came here on a Sunday with a friend for lunch.</li><li>Came here for lunch.</li><li>Anyone who thinks it 's ' expensive' needs to pack a

with my friends for a nice lunch.</li><li>Particularly for lunch or dinner, dine-in ( they also do take-out).</li><li>This place is the best for lunch.</li><li>Definitely a once in a while place to go to but youd lose too much money going there everyday for lunch.</li><li>Lunch special portions at $ 10 mean you can have lunch AND leftovers for dinner!</li><li>The prices are also ridiculously low for lunch.</li><li>That was $ 160, for 3 people, for a large lunch.</li><li>Quick lunch ?</li><li>Very satisfying. satay on the road has been one of my family 's favorite restaurants since i was a kid. i remember coming here when i was ten and ordering the same thing that i get now, ten years later: cashew nut chicken with an order of steamed rice and the shrimp chips with peanut sauce. first of all, the food tastes delicious. i think there 's been one or two times out of the hundreds of visits to this place where the food tasted a little spicier than usual but other than that, it 's been consistently amazing for close to a decade. i 've had cashew nut chicken at other thai restaurants and it just does n't compare. i ca n't speak about most of their other food but from what i 've experienced they 've been by far the best tasting thai restaurant in and around toronto. the wait staff is quick and friendly for the most part which is great. the atmosphere of the restaurant is nice ... they just re-did it and although i have to say i prefer the original decor which had an authentic thai feel to it, their modern, contemporary approach to their new `` look'' is very pleasing to the eyes and enjoyable to dine at as well. the value of the food is great. my girlfriend and i come here for their lunch special almost every week at least once and have a full meal with a drink that leaves us satisfied for both taste and hunger for usually under $ 10, 15% tip included. how can you beat that ? really. not to mention, you can order shrimp chips and peanut sauce as an appetizer while you wait for your meal, at no charge. i have yet to find another thai restaurant in toronto that has that. five stars to my favorite thai place since i was ten. i was happy to see that they expanded and opened another store on bayview. good for them!</li><li>Good if you work in the area and looking for a lunch.</li><li>I order through uber eats with them if I forget my lunch at work.</li><li>Great place for lunch.</li><li>Before my office moved downtown, we used to come here for `` all-you-can-eat'' sushi at lunch.</li><li>Went for ATCE lunch on a weekday.</li><li>The lunch is amazing-delicious, fresh chicken with some parisienne potatoes and veggies, or rice.</li><li>We went back a few times for take out for lunch but then, disaster struck: they charged me for the bread.</li><li>Look- this place is $ 8 for lunch, taxes in.</li><li>Lunch is a bad experience with a dark interior, an Asian man in an ill-fitting suit who pours the soy sauce for you and says `` watch out for the wasabi'', and an Asian woman with a geisha outfit that does n't know the first thing about poise, etiquette and gracefulness.</li><li>I 've come here several times for lunch.</li><li>The price is a bit on the high side for lunch.</li><li>Second chance has come and gone with their Mussels special for lunch.</li><li>Which was great as I was on lunch from work, and needed to be quick.</li><li>I do n't recommend Going at dinner or lunch because the food slides down.doiring dinner and sometimes lunch everyday they have specials that have not very good food for a decent price.</li><li>The pork bone soup was enough for two meals ( I 'm REALLY looking forward to lunch today!)</li><li>They have lunch specials, very reasonable pricing here- On Saturday, my mum and I ordered a mix of dim sum items and lunch specials- Lunch A w Lemon Chicken ( $ 10) + Pan fried pork dumplings + Peanut dumplings.</li><li>It 's an especially great place to get away from the York campus for lunch.</li><li>I would come back when I 'm in the mood for a relatively light lunch.</li><li>Love this place for lunch.</li><li>Small place so either book and or show up early for lunch.</li><li>When I 've gone mid day for a late lunch, St. Louis is quieter and the waiters seem to have a bit more breathing room.</li><li>We do n't come for the service but we do n't have to wait for a seat during the Sunday lunch hour so it 's bearable.</li><li>I 've had lunch delivered to me at home a few times and also to my old workplace in Scarborough.</li><li>Their lunch and dinner looked fine from the tables around.</li><li>I came here yesterday with a coworker for a quick lunch.</li><li>My coworker simply ordered Chicken Fried Rice for lunch but I wanted to compare their bento boxes to those I 've had elsewhere so I opted for the Teriyaki Chicken.</li><li>My poor coworker, who does n't seem to have much lunch when coming out with me for Korean food, did n't like her rice at all and I must say, it did n't look overly appetizing either.</li><li>This place is ok, provides lots of food and decent value for lunch.</li><li>I enjoy the lamb, and I do recognize that all the meats are frozen ( what are you gonna do for a $ 12 lunch ?).</li><li>Great value ( for lunch).</li><li>Do n't think that I 'm willing to pay the dinner prices, but will definitely return for the weekday lunch ( $ 13.95).</li><li>I have been here for lunch a few times with groups from work and I think they have something for everyone- seafood, veg, different meats, styles and spice.</li><li>Lunch on holidays and weekends, $ 14.99 for Adult, $ 8.99 for kids under 13.</li><li>Great variety and price-quality is pretty good ( for lunch, dinner is more expensive).</li><li>Edit: price wise, this place is only worth it during weekdays for lunch ( 12.99 as of 2014), but I 'd probably not pay 26 for dinner at this place.</li><li>Went for lunch, was busy but never really waited on anything, not food or drinks.</li><li>Went for lunch.</li><li>Also a very good value for lunch.</li><li>My boyfriend and I decided to have lunch here.</li><li>Was in the area and my parents decided to pop in here for a late lunch.</li><li>Expect to wait if you arrive around dinner or lunch.</li><li>Other than that service is friendly and efficient, so it is ok to drop by for a late night snack or quick lunch, but my heart remains set on Congee Queen as it is really the queen of my congee.</li><li>I usually buy it for lunch and eat the leftovers for dinner.</li><li>Dropping by for lunch is always an option for me because it 's quick and delicious.</li><li>I ate half for dinner last night and half for lunch today.</li><li>Recommended for lunch.</li><li>Had lunch here last week for the first time.</li><li>Ordered over-medium once and received over easy, which was unappetising and went uneaten. ... love this mom and pops place! the staff is quite friendly and the owner always greets us personally whenever he 's around. i have personally only ever ordered from their all day breakfast menu so i ca n't speak for their lunch and dinner but it is the best breakfast at the most decent price. while i have ordered many breakfast dishes, my favorite go-to is the eggs benedict with smoked salmon and asparagus. i must have had this dish once a week for the past year and it 's been cooked to perfection every time. the sauce is not too heavy, not too light. the eggs are always made the way you like it- i make sure i get them to soft poach them. home fries are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. weekend mornings and brunch time get pretty busy but it is always worth the wait:).</li><li>Went here today for lunch.</li><li>A local joint which I visit regularly, Kenzo serves up decent bowls of ramen- perfect for a quick lunch or dinner on a cold winter day.</li><li>Went there on a quiet weekday afternoon for lunch.</li><li>We ordered Sapporo Miso Ramen, tonkatsu lunch and gyoza.</li><li>Belly Buster had a prominent role in my last year of high school: I 'd have a spare before lunch, pile into a car with a bunch of friends, and trek north to Belly 's.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
