<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 577' %><h2>guy<br />occurrence: 6</h2><div><ol><li>The place is strictly takeout ( though the guy asked me if it was for here.</li><li>The place was run by a really nice, outgoing guy ( Jerry ?) who was talkative with everyone that came in.</li><li>Serves was bad, the guy was literally talking to his coworker while I was waiting for the water.</li><li>The service here sucks big time UNLESS you get the lady manager or the guy manager they are both very polite and very caring about the customer service but the actual servers do n't care at all.</li><li>It took a bit of time to order but there was no one behind us in line and the guy looked annoyed we were taking long.</li><li>I filled two bowls for one meal which came out to one bowl at the end, The guy working the grill was friendly and fast, The buffet was great, lots of options, I loved the shau mai ( which I know I did n't spell correctly) and the lotus seed bun as well as the fried goyza ( again another spelling mistake;)) The dessert was nearly the best part of the entire meal, there was a lot of options and the slush machine and chocolate fountain had to be my favriote.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
