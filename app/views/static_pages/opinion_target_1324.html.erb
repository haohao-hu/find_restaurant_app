<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1324' %><h2>sub sauce<br />occurrence: 3</h2><div><ol><li>No sub sauce, no mayo ... just the tzatziki sauce.</li><li>I probably wo n't be back; something 's fishy here that does n't blend with my tastes ... i 'm not sure exactly what it is about this place that 's kept me coming back. i think it 's probably the ... ridiculously amazing subs they make! i 've been coming here for about 10 years now, and i think it 's possible that the submarines have gotten better since. seating is a bit limited, but as long as you do n't go during the rush hours, you should be fine. be prepared to wait 10 mins if it 's after last call and you 've got a craving. their bacon is just the right crispiness, their meats are fresh, fleshly diced lettuce, freshly sliced tomatoes and onions, homemade sub sauce, soft bread. mmmmmm i love that the walls are decorated with photos of loyal customers, some dating back to times when fashion meant a mullet: S they even have a pic with the stanley cup! this local spot has a following for a reason. if you love submarine sandwiches, you have to try one at belly busters. must gets are: anything with bacon `` lettuce, tomatoes, onions guys ?''</li><li>BLT Sub- just extra tomatoes and lettuce, sub sauce + mayo 2.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
