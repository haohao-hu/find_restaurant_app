<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 122' %><h2>coleslaw<br />occurrence: 55</h2><div><ol><li>The sandwich was a good size for the price ( special $ 8.95) and came with fries and coleslaw.</li><li>Two of us got falafel pitas and one got a chicken shawarma pita with extra coleslaw and feta inside.</li><li>The coleslaw was also delicious because it was n't the creamy type, but made with more of a vinegar of some sort ...</li><li>TOVLI. luckily i work in this neck of the woods, otherwise it would be pretty heroic ( but SO worth it!) to come up here for lunch from downtown! there is another location just south of wilson on bathurst, but i think that 's it. i love falafels, and i think that TOVLI has the best in the city. and yes it 's those sexy falafel sandwiches that i adore ... the falafel balls alone are pretty fabulous, but the sandwiches rock! stuffed full of their salad ( a kind of coleslaw) and your choice of pickled turnips ( my favourite) and such, they are HUGE and wonderful. definitely not for first dates or for in the car, these require 2 hands, lots of napkins and a good appetite!</li><li>I like to keep the toppings traditional- hummus, hot sauce, tahini, coleslaw and Israeli salad.</li><li>The taters are pretty salty; the coleslaw is salty as well.</li><li>The sandwich is then stuffed with tomatoes, lettuce, coleslaw, hummus, and garlic or tahini sauce.</li><li>The chicken was tender and the coleslaw was creamy which made for such a wonderful combination.</li><li>I love the creaminess and crunch of the coleslaw and every bit had some of that slaw with a bite of chicken as well.</li><li>When we finally made it there on a Sunday morning, we had the corned beef sandwich, smoked meat sandwich, with coleslaw, potato salad and pickles.</li><li>The jerk chicken is the best around, very juicy, flavourful, and great with the coleslaw they serve.</li><li>It 's pretty creamy coleslaw, so probably has quite a bit of mayo, but it 's great.</li><li>Great jerk chicken and coleslaw in cocoa bread.</li><li>The spice of the chicken, the creaminess of the coleslaw and the sweetness of the bread.</li><li>Perfect amount of coleslaw and a healthy amount of jerk chicken in a nice coco-bun.</li><li>Delicious and juicy chicken full of flavour, the coco bread is fresh and has a hint of sweetness which balances the spicy chicken and creamy coleslaw perfectly.</li><li>I usually get a small pork, small chicken, two patties, and a coleslaw to share between two people.</li><li>I had the halibut and fries and they give you the smallest portion of coleslaw which was tasty and leaving me wanting more.</li><li>I would recommend you get the coleslaw and buttered bread.</li><li>The coleslaw was kind of creamy and just meh.</li><li>Try their coleslaw too, it 's yummy.</li><li>The side options are fries, creamy coleslaw, mushy peas, and onion things.</li><li>Chicken Breast Shishkebob with mash potatoes and coleslaw 2.</li><li>The coleslaw, ( a side order we both had included with our entrees) was thinly shaved cabbage with a light dressing, it was crisp and complimented the meals very nicely.</li><li>Got several lunch specials ( 1/4 chicken, coleslaw, rice with peas and gravy) and the Jamaican patty.</li><li>Their coleslaw has no dressing to it its just dry you need flavour.</li><li>Their coleslaw has moist to it, dressing is so delicious.</li><li>The coffee, coleslaw and cheesecake are fine without standing out.</li><li>I ordered a sandwich with a side of the coleslaw ( in a vinegar dressing).</li><li>Anyhoo-lots of meat on soft bread, delicious sweet hot mustard ( buy some to take home like we do to put on our own homemade creations), greasy knishes ( I could only eat half before feeling like my face was gonna break out in a massive acne outbreak), and over mayo 'd sides like coleslaw, mac salad and potato salad.</li><li>Their coleslaw is fresh and compliments the sticky rice the chicken comes served on.</li><li>You have a choice of coleslaw and veg.</li><li>You get coleslaw, rice and peas accompanying your meat selection.</li><li>A few reasons to love Mr. Jerk- great flavor- great prices ( chicken and pork combo for 10 $ that 's good enough for 2 people)- great sides ( plantains, coleslaw, and chili all mesh well together)- large servings- gravy and rice are awesome I always order take-out and the worst part of the experience is the drive home hungry while the aroma of the grilled chicken fills the car.</li><li>The Jerk Chicken lunch special comes with rice and beans, coleslaw and gravy.</li><li>I prefer a more saucy coleslaw but it was good nonetheless.</li><li>The coleslaw was sweet and crunchy and blends well with the hot sauce to add the right kick to the sandwich.</li><li>The meat was tender and moist, the rye bread was fresh, the fries were crispy, and the coleslaw and pickle were just right.</li><li>( Although I have to complement the people they have for doing their best to keep things running smoothly, our server this time was great)- The food portions are a smaller than they used to be, including for items like fries and coleslaw.</li><li>They also serve an appetitizer of pickled radish, lettuce and coleslaw.</li><li>As for the appetizers, the lettuce salad was average, but I enjoyed the coleslaw and the cubes of pickled something ( not sure what it was).</li><li>The chicken is n't the only star in the meal, the rice and coleslaw provides the same amount of attention.</li><li>Even the coleslaw was fresh and crunchy.</li><li>The coleslaw and rice that came with the meats were okay.</li><li>Ordered the rib sampler with fries and coleslaw.</li><li>I started ordering coleslaw.</li><li>Then they started giving me fries instead of my order of coleslaw.</li><li>Thank goodness I stayed away from the coleslaw!</li><li>Good coleslaw, a tad heavy on the celery seed but still good.</li><li>The tacos are very tasty- 4 small, rolled, fried tacos, similar to taquitos or flautas, covered in sauce, served with that same coleslaw ..</li><li>The baked beans were also cold with oil floating on top and the coleslaw was drenched in white vinegar.</li><li>The coleslaw was awful.</li><li>The coleslaw was decent, and the garlic bread was nothing special.</li><li>I ordered the Vege Omelette and substituted the fries for a coleslaw.</li><li>Aside from the omelette, the coleslaw was alright.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
