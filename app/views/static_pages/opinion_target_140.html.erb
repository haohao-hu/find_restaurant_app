Put bluntly, Tov-Li makes the single, absolute best falafel that I have ever tasted.</li><li>I prefer the Israeli chickpea-only style, though primarily because I like thetaste; it 's a brighter, less beany falafel and a better showcase for garlic, cumin and cilantro.</li><li>The falafel at Tov is second to none.</li><li>Best falafel in the city.</li><li>Best falafel in town.</li><li>I 've had their pizza and salads as well but the falafel is what brings me back.</li><li>Their falafel is super tasty and filling too.</li><li>The best falafel I 've ever had.</li><li>This kosher, Cholov Yisrael dairy restaurant does pizza, dessert, veggie burgers, sandwiches, all day Israeli-style breakfast, falafel, ice-cream, soups and fish.</li><li>The only thing that gives their shawarma taste is their thina and the hot sauce.- pitas are the cheap, paper-thin variety. they use them as a wrap, not as a pita ' pocket' style.- falafel actually is worse than the shawarma ( I think they make it in the morning, and just serve it throughout the day)- owner ( or one of the owners ?), when he works, has 0 customer service skills. not pleasant to deal with The fact that this place is around proves the mantra ' location-location-location'.</li><li>This location has great hours and the guys are quick and service is wonderful, falafel you like ??!!</li><li>The falafel is left out what tasted like all day and microwaved instead of being fresh cooked.</li><li>He told me he would start the falafel, which takes some time to cook, so that when we came in we could pick our toppings and be on on our way.</li><li>When we came in, the falafel was ready, our pitas ( choice of regular/whole wheat) were ready to be topped.</li><li>As for the food we ordered hummus ( approx $ 6), veggie pizza ( $ 5.99), lamb plate ( $ 18.99), mixed meat plate ( $ 20.99) and falafel ( 0.99).</li><li>Do I get Yelp-branded bronze epaulettes ?). the falafel is fresh and the toppings are the best in the city .... great bargain.</li><li>Was n't that cheap for falafel.</li><li>Every falafel I ate was always so dry and left a horrible taste in my mouth.</li><li>Best falafel they make it fresh and the spicy garlic fries are to die for.</li><li>Appetizers: The falafel is delicious.</li><li>The best falafel I 've tasted -- very crunchy, crispy exterior, and soft inside, and very hot ( freshly deep fried).</li><li>Got the Vegetable Combo Platter with Meat ( with hummus, baba ghanoush, falafel, tabouli, and shawarma)- also served optionally without meat btw.</li><li>This is straight up middle eastern food: falafel, tabbouleh, shawarma, etc.</li><li>The vegetarian combo with meat ( hehe, funny name) is really good, where you get to try the dips, the tabouleh, the falafel, as well as a shawarma of your choosing ( the shawarma was so-so, but hey, if you gotta have meat ...).</li><li>I love pickled turnips, I think no falafel is complete without a pink pickled turnip inside to tantalize your tastebuds and warm your insides to satisfy your desire for the perfect falafel.
