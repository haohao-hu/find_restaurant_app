<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 322' %><h2>waffle<br />occurrence: 13</h2><div><ol><li>However when we did order the deserts. it took about 20 minutes for each desert to arrive separately. which made it basically an hour before we got to the waffle The good thing is we are all sharing the desert as a group. otherwise the wait time was so long that we would literally be waiting for each person to take their turns eating desert. since it arrived almost like a banquet course by course timing.</li><li>The mango was also pretty good, however the strawberry was better balance in the desert. and the waffle had a good presentation value. the only thing about the waffle is that its definitely not what they show you on the menu, on the menu they advertise the oreo waffle as a waffle infused with oreo and chocolate flavour, with vanilla ice cream on it.</li><li>The waffle and green tea ice cream is average.</li><li>I loved my strawberry cheesecake waffle. the waffle was soft but crispy on the outside, perfectly cooked ( some places always overcook them), the little cheesecake pieces with the fruits and ice-cream went very well together.</li><li>The portions are pretty huge- so if you 're going there with an empty stomach you can eat the crepe/waffle by yourself no problem! but the waffle is definitely more filling, so if you are just going to have a small dessert, go with a friend and share:).</li><li>It is a small cafe that serves desserts like waffle, crepes, sundaes, cake and specialty coffee.</li><li>The quality of crepe and waffle was not the best; it did n't taste fresh, the waffle was soggy.</li><li>I will say waffle is better than crepe.</li><li>The waffle and shortcake are tasty.</li><li>I thought the waffle was really good.</li><li>The quality of the waffle is so fresh too.</li><li>This place has the most delicious waffle ..</li><li>My wife had the Loaded Waffle which she hoovered up really fast ... it was a nice soft waffle with fresh fruit and the whipped cream, though artificial, tasted good with it, she said.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
