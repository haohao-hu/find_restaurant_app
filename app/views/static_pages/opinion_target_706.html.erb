<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 706' %><h2>ginseng<br />occurrence: 6</h2><div><ol><li>I 've tried several other restaurants that offer the chicken ginseng soup, but the one here is probably one of the best I 've tried- you can actually taste the ginseng.</li><li>My food came out a delicious dish with a hot, steaming, a small chicken stuffed with rice, ginseng, garlic, and jujube.</li><li>The soup itself is very clear and subtle ( can barely taste the ginseng), and it 's great for a cold day.</li><li>The chicken was very tender and soft but the ginseng was very subtle unless you get to the sticky rice filling where you find the ginseng, korean date, and chestnut.</li><li>It was a lot of food as you get the whole chicken that is stuffed with glutinous rice, a ginseng, a date, and herbs per pot.</li><li>Things like how good the ginseng they used in the soup, now they no longer say anything about it.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
