<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1261' %><h2>corn soup<br />occurrence: 3</h2><div><ol><li>Per Devan 's suggestion, I drizzled a little chile oil into the corn soup which brought another dimension to the broth.</li><li>I had a pozole ( spicey stewed pork, corn soup), it was a good portion as it came with a fried tortilla with sour cream, and all the condiments to put into the soup ( radish, lettuce, oregano, cayenne pepper powder, onions) my husband had the combo which came with an enchilada, a burrito, and refried beans in a taco basket.</li><li>While I do n't think I 'd order the pastas we got this time again, I would come here again for that creamy corn soup, to try more of their desserts, or to try more on their menu- Paisano 's has a lot to offer and I 'm always down to try more Italian cuisine.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
