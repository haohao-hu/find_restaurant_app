<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 91' %><h2>hummus<br />occurrence: 64</h2><div><ol><li>Besides salads, you can also choose from a wide selection of stone baked breads, banana chocolate loafs, two types of soups, and a selection of hummus and pitas, and fruits.</li><li>First of all, they 're the size of a nerf football, the pitas are absolutely packed full of fillings including hummus, tahini, tomatoes and cucumbers.</li><li>Next time, I 'm going to try the veggie appetizer plate I saw a lady mowing down on in the restaurant which had hummus, baba ganouj, olives, fried eggplant, beets and mushrooms !!</li><li>My recommendations would be the hummus, chicken shish kabob, and shawarma.</li><li>A mixed salad plate opens a world of possibilities; eggplant, carrot, beet, turnip, hummus ` n ' tahini and other options could unclog the arteries of the most hardcore carnivore, especially when scooped up with fresh, fluffy pita bread.</li><li>I like to keep the toppings traditional- hummus, hot sauce, tahini, coleslaw and Israeli salad.</li><li>The hummus was watery and tasted like nothing.</li><li>I ordered up a Chicken Shawarma with all the fixins ( garlic, hummus, lettuce, tomatoes, tahini, and extra hot sauce).</li><li>We also ordered the hummus-you CANNOT find hummus like this ANYWHERE ELSE!</li><li>I 've tried hummus at several different restaurants, bought hummus from the grocery store and I have not been able to find anything that matches this.</li><li>The bread they serve with the hummus is SO delicious as well, great combination.</li><li>The hummus and the salmon Salad with saut√©ed mushrooms ?!</li><li>The hummus plate is probably the best hummus I have had anywhere.</li><li>The sandwich is then stuffed with tomatoes, lettuce, coleslaw, hummus, and garlic or tahini sauce.</li><li>But must mention the following too:- Line up to pay- Onion grilled with the skin still on ( from no frills to the grills)- half chicken not fully cooked inside but burnt outside- too much tahini in the hummus- beef a bit dry Other than that the rest was good.</li><li>As for the food we ordered hummus ( approx $ 6), veggie pizza ( $ 5.99), lamb plate ( $ 18.99), mixed meat plate ( $ 20.99) and falafel ( 0.99).</li><li>It tasted amazing with the hummus which was excellent and we just ate it with absolutely everything.</li><li>I 'm also not quite sure where the hummus came from, while I thought we were supposed to get fattoush.</li><li>Also try the hummus and arais.</li><li>Ordered hummus, lamb and chicken shawarma.</li><li>They forgot to get my basket of bread, I had to ask for it and they added some complimentary hummus and hot sauce ( which is the only reason this review gets two stars) No one bothered to check on us if we were having a good meal nor did anyone bother to fill our water.</li><li>The man asked us if we wanted hummus or baba ganoush and we said that we would like hummus assuming that it came with our meal.</li><li>Our bread came quickly and we were given a full size order of hummus and then checked our bill and realized he had charged us for a full size hummus instead of giving us the small sized sides that already come with the meals.</li><li>When we had finished our sub par meals my friend then had to go find the manager in order to get a refund on the hummus we were charged for that we did n't even want and he was n't even the person that refunded the money it was the girl who was the server.</li><li>We ordered a side of hummus and a side of baba ganoush and we had a lot of leftovers so we wanted pita to go and they say no you need to pay 50 cents for an extra pita ???!!!</li><li>Their dips are n't good I tried hummus and tabouli.</li><li>They fill the pocket with freshly made falafel balls, heaps of beautiful vegetables, and finish with tons delicious hummus, tahini, and hot sauce.</li><li>It 's only good with the hummus, garlic and hot sauce, so always ask for more sauce just for the food to taste marinated and seasoned well.</li><li>The menu consists of shawarmas ( Lamb, chicken, beef), falafel, kebabs ( beef or chicken) in a pita or as a platter with salad, hummus, garlic sauce and rice or fries for the meat options.</li><li>It came with some ok hummus and a very potent garlic sauce, which is more crushed garlic then sauce.</li><li>They also have plates of hummus and baba ghannouj that are flavourful and pair well with fresh pita.</li><li>The large amount of garlic paste and hummus on your plate is also worth noting!</li><li>The only reason I deducted a star was because the chicken shawarma was too dry ( I smothered it in my hummus, haha).</li><li>Got the Vegetable Combo Platter with Meat ( with hummus, baba ghanoush, falafel, tabouli, and shawarma)- also served optionally without meat btw.</li><li>The felafel/ tabbouleh/ hummus and Baba Ghanouge are great.</li><li>I Always order the fried eggplant and hummus!</li><li>Always leave with a takeout order of hummus!</li><li>Had high hopes, but disappointed The veggie platter was good I was told and the hummus was respectable, but the non-veg was a big disappointment.</li><li>Dumpy little plaza but do n't be shy, you have to try the hummus !!!</li><li>The hummus was pretty good, it was quite creamy and went well with their house made hot sauce; however I felt like a little more garlic would have elevated this dish.</li><li>And since we like Levantine food, we can appreciate a good meal of hummus, ful, falafel, and eggplant.</li><li>Great hummus and chicken kabob.</li><li>This came with three falafel 's, hummus, baba ghannouj, tabuleh salad and some very nice pieces of chicken shawarma.</li><li>The salad, hummus, falafel 's and chicken shawarma were very good.</li><li>The veggie platter has labneh ( pressed yogurt), baba ghanoush, hummus, tabbouleh and a few falafels ( these will not be enough, order more!).</li><li>The Felafel are perfect, and the hummus is the best I 've had in Toronto.</li><li>The dips- hummus, baba ganoush, and labneh- are phenomenal though, as is the fatouche salad ( $ 4.50 Regular, $ 8 Large).</li><li>The hummus &amp; baba ganoush is just the way I like it- not too much tahini.</li><li>The hummus is some of the best you can get at a restaurant.</li><li>Their hummus is good and tasty, I 've had much better babaganoush ( Famous Laffa) but it was n't bad and the third dip was eggplant in some sort of tomato based sauce.</li><li>For the sides; hummus, red cabbage, sliced tomatoes, onion herb mix and banana peppers with tahini sauce.</li><li>The prices are standard with the exception of the laffa bread and hummus ( almost $ 9 for a container of hummus to go).</li><li>The prices are standard with the exception of the laffa bread and hummus ( almost $ 9 for a container of hummus to go).</li><li>Not enough laffa comes with the hummus.</li><li>Any hummus.</li><li>With an order of hummus, one gets two small laffas.</li><li>We still ended up taking some of the hummus home.</li><li>This is not to say that the portion of hummus was huge.</li><li>They bring you bread and a homemade hummus to start.</li><li>I really like the hummus, there 's a bit of a curry kick to it.</li><li>The veggies and hummus they add are beyond delicious.</li><li>I usually ask for hummus and fried eggplant.</li><li>My usual, start with the hummus, my main is the white chicken breast kabob, with home potatoes.</li><li>The hummus is soft and not too garlicky; which is great, because it soothes after-taste, or lessens it at the very least.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
