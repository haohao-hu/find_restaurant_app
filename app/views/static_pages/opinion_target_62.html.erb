<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 62' %><h2>veggies<br />occurrence: 128</h2><div><ol><li>The veggies, all cold.</li><li>Bistec carne frita: Typical Chilean dish, served with flavorful rice, beef steak, veggies.</li><li>You get some of those delicious dumplings, and thick yummy noodles, rice cakes ( tip: wait to eat them at the end so that they 've soaked up all that flavourful broth), mushrooms, veggies ...</li><li>The salad bar contains mostly starchy stuff like cold pastas or raw unflavoured veggies that have been sitting outside under their lights all day. the meals are mediocre ( the meat is always wayyy too chewy. too hard to chew or swallow. you know when steak is like that ? yeah.) and not anything special.</li><li>The waitress thought the steak sandwiches were steak entrees and had to send the food back and tried to convince my friends to keep the side veggies the steaks came with instead of fries the sandwiches came with.</li><li>Lots of frozen fish and some frozen veggies available all at competitive prices.</li><li>Outside of that, my favourite dish is Hwe Dup Bap which is a bowl of rice and veggies with an assortment of raw fish on top and a special spicy sauce ( made from scratch, I bet you because it 's different and way better than the same sauce elsewhere).</li><li>I am a fan of their Japanese/ Korean mix in Bento Boxes, offering Kalbi or Bulgogi as the main protein to go along with Tempura shrimp and veggies.</li><li>They had salads, eggplant, veggies to the cooked meat from chicken in various styles from baked, breaded and stuffed to fish and pork.</li><li>All the food served with rice and veggies except pho of cuz.</li><li>I got a steak, mashed potatoes and veggies.</li><li>The veggies were so peppered it had me coughing!</li><li>Being vegan, I have to exclude the beef and egg from my bibimbap, so the variety, freshness, and flavour of the veggies is what I look for.</li><li>The veggies are perfectly sautéed and very vibrant, which makes for a beautiful bibimbap.</li><li>The meat also felt very unfresh and the combination of veggies did n't even give the rice any flavour.</li><li>Moving on to the main dishes, the Shrimp sizzler tasted more Indian than Chinese, even with the spring onions and crisp veggies, a bit like how my grandma makes it ( her cooking is Burmese/Indian influenced).</li><li>Reason being more than half of it is healthy veggies and salads including my favorite beet and turnip pickles!</li><li>The chicken itself has a pretty good flavor, but the wilted lettuce and sorry looking toppings always have me disappointed, and somehow there were fruit flies buzzing around all the veggies even though it 's- 4 degrees out ..</li><li>When I ordered normal food they were out of veggies and I ended up getting a whole lot of broccoli and chicken.</li><li>A bed of soft noodles loaded up on top with Shrimps, Chicken, Beef, BBQ Pork and fresh Veggies.</li><li>Veggies are crisp and fresh, BBQ Pork is not hard or dry but tender and juicy.</li><li>The portion is substantial, and they do n't cheap out on the veggies they add to the bun.</li><li>Not a fan of the noodles or the rice but the veggies and plantation bananas are all right I guess ( I 'm a carnivore to the core so if it is n't meat it 's a distraction anyway).</li><li>The veggies and mashed potatoes were good.</li><li>My side of ' seasonal veggies' was overcooked, and the bell peppers were too soft and with no crunch to it.</li><li>Food came out .. chicken dry .. but edible .. hubbys veggies were raw and my wild rice was hard as a rock.</li><li>Had the following Calamari- Not too greasy, could be a bit crispier but thoroughly enjoyed it with the Cajun dip Tortilla and Dip- Tasty and refills of tortillas was offered by our server Ribs with Fries n Beans- Ribs were prepared quite good, fall off the bone, not too fatty, not too much muscle fibers, sauce was good, fries were crispy, bans were not mush, definitely recommended NY and Top Sirloin Steak was cooked proper to medium rare, for the price it had a decent depth of flavor, salad that came with it was pretty standard, veggies were cooked well, mashed potatoes was good, first time having the Peppercorn sauce not taste like burnt chocolate, bravo to the new kitchen staff Probably will come back but I 'll probably request Miranda as my server as there 's been too many servers that take their job for granted at this location.*** note they do n't validate parking anymore 2apps 3 entrees Above average gratuity Around $ 150 for 3 happy and full people Will come back to this location if I 'm having a craving for tender ribs.</li><li>I used to love the fresh veggies ( carrots, cauliflower &amp; broccoli), instead we got a few limp and oily pieces of pepper, and one piece of cauliflower.</li><li>We ordered the Kashk Bademjam ( puree of golden fried eggplant with onion whey and mint), Persian soup ( veggies, noodles, pinto beans, whey, sauteed garlic and mint), and Koobideh ( charbroiled, seasoned ground beef) Kebab with rice.</li><li>The freshest thing was the veggies.</li><li>Luckily there was a lovely lady that recommended the Shish Tawouk Plate $ 13.99 which is basically chicken kabob with rice and veggies.</li><li>The chicken pie is especially delicious with a nice balance of crust, creme, chicken and veggies.</li><li>What I loved:- extra cheese included many choices such as goat cheese, cheddar and Monterey Jack- extra bacon included 2-3 slices- guacamole was free- lots of great fixings to order from, veggies were also fresh ...- so much free sauce and spices ...</li><li>The best dishes seem to be the stir fried variety ( fried chicken with bits of garlic, shrimp with shells in superior soy, most veggies).</li><li>The noodles were a combination of egg noodles and vermicelli, that included a `` sahog'' of various meat including chicken, shrimp, bits of lechon kawali, and some veggies.</li><li>I wish we had ordered veggies to balance the meal.</li><li>Lechon Kawali ( crispy fried pork), pancit canton ( thick egg noodles w/ veggies in a tasty sauce), beefsteak ( thinly sliced beef w/ onions in a rich sauce) and the best Garlic rice I 've ever had ( think Chinese fried rice w/o all the soy sauce just lots of garlic).</li><li>Flavourful peanut sauce with crispy veggies and soft oxtail ...</li><li>The rice was not warm, and the veggies were hard, not cooked but flashed to heat.</li><li>2) Rice noodle with beef and black bean sauce- very good, not dry and the perfect ratio of veggies to noodles.</li><li>Grilled salmon was perfectly cooked, then unpredictably slathered in teriyaki sauce, and came with grilled and some less-grilled veggies- raw onion definitely wo n't impress a date.</li><li>Red curry with shrimp: A little more spicy with nice veggies in there as well.</li><li>Veggies tasted fresh.</li><li>There were a lot of unnecessary veggies, and what I think were pickles.</li><li>My burger had all of the major food groups: spice, cheese, veggies, bacon, and beef.</li><li>All the veggies were raw and the chicken was half-cooked so it took awhile for everything in the hotpot to to be fully cooked, but it was worth the wait!</li><li>The dumpling and rice cake soup was fantastic with a delicious soup and good dumplings and rice cakes and the spicy fiddlehead soup was hot and flavourful and full of meat and veggies.</li><li>5) jap chae ( stir fried noodle with vegetables)- lots of veggies and meat, always comes out super hot and fresh, and never gets too ' sticky' or ' clumpy'. one of the best places for jap chae.</li><li>I craved for more veggies in the noodle soup but honestly it was quite a perfect meal and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.</li><li>My breaded veal with peppercorn was not working for me at all but the veggies were n't bad.</li><li>It was perfectly balanced with the veggies and meat/shrimps.</li><li>I ordered the most famous curry apparently and all it was was a curry sauce, thrown veggies in there and pre cooked thrown meat.</li><li>The chicken was well seasoned and the veggies were fresh and crunchy.</li><li>Veggies werent cook all the way ( not even the aldente standard) .. we ordered two medium rare steaks one came almost right the other over done.</li><li>I got the cheese, rice cake, fish cake, veggies and extra ramen for this ramen dish and it was shared among two people.</li><li>The $ 9.25 is the basic which includes the chicken, sauce, and some veggies.</li><li>YUM! bad part is that the veggies is no really good or much variety. and you can only order one order of instant noodles, even if you want more and want to add money ? no way.</li><li>Lots of veggies, meat, starch.</li><li>Making a roast takes time because the meat needs to be `` slow-cooked'' to reduce the toughness and make it fall off the bone, plus you need the right combo of spices and veggies to bring out the flavour.</li><li>The size of the rolls are huge the dynamite rolls are stuffed with fresh fish, tempura shrimp and veggies topped with a fish of choice and fish roe.</li><li>The good- dumplings, fried rice, noodles, and veggies.</li><li>After the dumplings were served, they brought out plates of veggies ( green beans and spinach), then the rice and noodle dishes.</li><li>We had a platter of tofu, cold pig ears, pork belly, veggies, Peking duck two ways ( wraps and lettuce), fried rice, and lobster.</li><li>The salad was also simple, with some grilled onions and other veggies.</li><li>Ordered: Porkbelly BBQ ( Sam Kyup Sal)* Pork belly BBQ served with mushrooms, onions and veggies for wrapping* You cook this on a BBQ grill at your table* Served with green onions and you can add it to your ' ssam' Green onions with chili powder and some vinegar for you to eat with the grilled meat Ordered: Marinated Beef ( Ju Mul Luk)* Beef mixed with veggies in a sweet sauce* I much prefer this over Bulgogi which I find it to be too sweet* This you also cook at your table with the grill Ordered: Kimchi Stew ( KimChi JjiGae)* It was interesting to see vermicelli in a Kimchi stew* The soup was just spicy enough and not too sour* Usually you eat this with a bowl of rice Ordered: Dumplings ( Mandoo)* These were Mul-Mandoo which means it is cooked in boiling water* You dip this into soy sauce Ordered: Spicy Soup ( Jjam Ppong Tang)* This is usually a noodle dish but this specific one was made without for drinking* It makes a nice dish to order when you are drinking soju* Filled with seafood and veggies Ordered: Seafood Pancake ( Hae Mul Pa Jeon)* There was n't much seafood in the pancake* I did n't really enjoy this Ordered: Spicy octopus &amp; pork* This is a table top cooking with veggies, octopus and pork* You can adjust the spiciness of this dish* Usually comes in 2 portions but we added an extra serving* Because there was so much food it did take a while to cook Conclusion: Now that I 've been back 3 times and tried couple things off their menu, I am convinced that even from their never-ending menu- they serve good Korean food.</li><li>The dol soht bibimbap was alright, there was a good amount of veggies in the dish, but it was n't hot enough.</li><li>Boo Daw Jung Gol ~ Kimchi hotpot with all the ingredients you can think of and it will varied from restaurants. ~ Here, there 's beansprout, sausage, spam, mushrooms, veggies and of course the instant noodle. ~ It 's as if you raid the fridge in the middle of the night for things to add to your instant noodle. ~ This is the ultimate dish to end a rather heavy drinking night;) Dduk Bok Gi ( Spicy Rice Cake) ~ With fish cake slices, all immerse in a thick spicy sauce. ~ Filling, yummy and cheap dish that I will never get tired of.</li><li>Very fresh food and veggies.</li><li>It comes wraped in warm toasted pita with all the veggies and served with a delicious tahini sauce.</li><li>The pho itself is flavorful and they give you generous portions with lots of veggies.</li><li>Bun Bo hue: way too much fish sauce, not a lot of meet, veggies were in fresh 2.</li><li>Should have more meat, veggies inside Rare beef and chicken pho ( small): fresh, lots of meat, noodles, great portion.</li><li>Chicken, veggies, rice, 6 pieces of sushi, and dessert) Overall, Ginza is cheap, yummy and close to anyone who lives far north in Toronto.</li><li>The toppings were very fresh and tasty, you could actually taste the different flavors in the veggies!</li><li>It was a nice dish when some of the spicy sauce was mixed in; the pot crisped the rice nicely, and the veggies were fresh.</li><li>Soontofu or Soondubu is probably my favourite Korean dish so far because it usually comes spicy, it has both meat ( should you choose), egg ( s), and veggies ( tofu, cabbage and stuff)!</li><li>The broth had a great spicy kick with some depth added by the veggies in it.</li><li>The tofu is silky and is complimented by different meats, seafood and veggies.</li><li>But I always manage to convince whoever is with me to partake in the Bimbimbob which is full of yummy veggies.</li><li>The bibimbap is great too .. all with fresh veggies.</li><li>Teppanyaki Ume ( see picture) is a very good full lunch which includes soup, salad, shrimp appetizer, rice, veggies, chicken and steak.</li><li>The teppan table experience tonight was nothing more than watching him cook our fish and some veggies.</li><li>It was a special that requires a group of 8, everyone got a few maki/sushi rolls, a bowl of salad, miso soup, fried rice, a shrimp, a scallop, chicken, mixed veggies, salmon and steak.</li><li>It 's assembly-line style ordering: type of tortitlla, type of meat ( I 've had pulled pork), toppings like veggies, cheese, guac ( EXTRA $ $), sour cream, and type of salsa ( warning: the hot IS hot).</li><li>I had the lasagna for my main and you can taste the freezer burn and the veggies in it were GROSS.</li><li>A lot of tender meat, enough veggies and a potato ( `` gamja'') was there.</li><li>I discovered that the lunch menu is only on weekdays so ordered the chicken piccata entrée .. best piccata I have had in years with fresh bread, steamed veggies and grilled potatoes!</li><li>They also included a soup starter, steamed fish, a rice dish, a noodle dish, and some veggies.</li><li>Both dinners came with generous portions of veggies and salads that have an `` in house'' dressing that is so good they should sell it for take home!</li><li>The main course was beef ribs, nicely done as well, good sides- mashed potatoes and veggies.</li><li>We had booked the typical ten course meal of assorted BBQ meats, fried chicken, Peking duck, lettuce wrap with minced duck, seafood egg drop soup, lobster, fried fish, veggies, fried rice, fried noodles, and dessert.</li><li>There was pickled beets and other veggies.</li><li>The veggies and hummus they add are beyond delicious.</li><li>Here is a blow by blow Salad: Veggies were fresh but drowned in an odd oily dressing.</li><li>The veggies were okay- it was a mix of zucchini, onion and mushrooms.</li><li>My favourite is the Tosilog ( cured pork, fried egg, and veggies) and the Filipino style spaghetti.</li><li>I enjoyed the veggies the most, good flavor in the pinakbet.</li><li>You can order a veggie patty instead of meat too, or get an assortment of cheeses, veggies and sauces on top.</li><li>The veggies are cooked to perfection and fresh, and the salmon is well seared and the sauce was tasty as well.</li><li>For the main, I had the special of the day which was a 6oz New York steak with crab cake and seasonal veggies.</li><li>It had the clear noodles, veggies, octopus and chicken.</li><li>Most of the meats and veggies were sliced, rather than in chunks.</li><li>Pick your meat ( pork, lamb, beef, chicken or several different kinds of seafood), veggies ( plenty of options), noodles ( 3 varieties) and sauce ( large selection of pre-mixed or create your own) and hand your bowl to the cook who has it ready for you in a minute or so after tossing it around on a huge hot plate with no oil, just water.</li><li>You select your meat and veggies and they also have a cooked buffet that contains chicken balls, shrimp, desserts, soups, and a variety of other delicious items.</li><li>I 'm almost certain that Genghis Khan did not conquer much of Central Asia and China by feeding his subjects a dizzying choose-your-own-adventure of meats, veggies, sauces and condiment sauces to be grilled on a giant stone lifesaver.</li><li>You pile it high in a bowl, from a choice of meats to a great variety of veggies, add sauce and/or seasonings and hand it over.</li><li>Do n't know the name but their main thing is a build your own dish ( pick from a large assortment of veggies, meats and sauces give to chef who cooks it for you on this 6-8 for wide circular flat top stove) which is incredible ... and the food too.</li><li>I am one of many who love the Mongolian Grill concept, where you pick your own ingredients, meats or seafood, add tons of fresh veggies, plus noodles, sauces, and condiments, and hand your choices off to the chefs who will sizzle it up for you, on their 700 degree flat top.</li><li>You can choose your veggies, your meat and your sauce and voila you have what I call stir steamed veggies within under 2 minutes.</li><li>You pile meat and veggies in a bowl, ladle them with sauce ingredients, and awaaaaayyy you go.</li><li>Plenty of signage explained each step of the process from meat, to why you should add veggies, the noodle station to the sauces.</li><li>At the back they have a selection of meats, veggies, aromatics, sauces, spices, noodles etc.</li><li>You take a bowl and load it up with protein, veggies, rice or noodles, and a ladle of sauce, and then you give it to the chef who stir-fries it on a huge flat teppan-table thing.</li><li>This place has a great build your own stirfry section, from the meats, to the veggies, to the sauce and spices, everything!</li><li>Pick your meats, veggies, noodles and sauces and watch while it all gets cooked on a huge flat grill while you wait ( about 30 seconds).</li><li>You select meat, veggies, sauces and they cook it in front of you.</li><li>The veggies are fresh and clean.</li><li>Also, the desert table is fun fun fun !! lots of selection plus a chocolate fountain^_^ For the adventurous choco lovers: They have an array of cut up fruits &amp; veggies.</li><li>Walk two steps and add veggies.</li><li>All the veggies I want ?</li><li>There is 2 main buffet tables with stuff like rice, veggies, meats- your regular chinese buffet items.</li><li>Fried noodles with wonderful veggies, seafood, and sauce.</li><li>Love their salt and pepper squid, their awesome selection of congee and veggies!</li><li>For example, one particular night, there was a live worm in my food- probably crawled out of the veggies in the kitchen on to my plate.</li><li>Again, limited spice in the curry but the rice noodle and bean sprouts and veggies all mixed up worked very well together.</li><li>Throughout the work week the veggies are all very fresh.</li><li>On the weekends, there were a few times that the cucumbers looked a little frosty/frozen but this has n't been the case in the last few months -- maybe there is higher cucumber turnover or the restaurant has made more of an effort to restock fresh veggies.</li><li>- I was very pleased with how clean it all was -- there was literally no mess, no sauce leaked out anywhere ... contrast that to some subs from Quiznos, which while good, have been known to fall apart completely ( pieces of chicken or various veggies falling out -- it has happened to me countless times) ( We knew it was CASH ONLY, but I 'm gonna add that here again just for others to note) As a side note, the prices quoted on their website are n't the same as in stores -- in fact, the in-store prices at this location were LOWER than the website 's PDF, across the board!</li></ol></div><ul
