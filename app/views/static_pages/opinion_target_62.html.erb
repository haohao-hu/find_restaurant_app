tasty), the deep fried fish ( generous portion and never fishy ... you know what I mean!) and the Taiwanese sausage ( can be ordered on it 's own or comes with the minced pork on rice with tea egg.)</li><li>The portion was a bit small for the amount of money I paid, and easily had what would be considered a second dinner at the party I attended afterwards.</li><li>We ordered kimchi jjigae ( kimchi soup), toboki and Kamja tang ( pork bone soup) Toboki is sweeter here not that spicy but still pretty good The portion here are smaller, and they only provide four side dishes.</li><li>I see why they say MINIMUM 2 portion because that 's probably my standard portion size when I visit next time.</li><li>The portion is pretty good, 2 servings can feed about 3 people, but it 's a minimum of 2 for the Dak Gal Bee.</li><li>The price was just under $ 17, food tasted decently great, the portion is a lot!</li><li>My friend liked it a lot, generous portion of fish.</li><li>Reasonable price and the portion is quite large for the price and I went in hungry!</li><li>The calamari was quite good, perfectly cooked and a generous portion.</li><li>Off the bat I was blown away by the combination of taste, portion and price.</li><li>It was my first time trying it yet I fell in love with the broth instantly, it came in a generous portion and all the lunch specials came with Korean black rice ( or purple rather) and ban chan ( side dishes).</li><li>I enjoy the Lahori Beef Kebab, my only complaint is the portion is a bit small for the price.</li><li>The portion was not very big but just enough for the both of us.</li><li>The large portion is chicken and rice for $ 10 and worth the price.</li><li>Although the portion was decently sized, I felt that the quality is n't there.</li><li>Recommend: 1, Definitely `` Sashimi'', Fresh, big portion, Juicy ...</li><li>I do n't anything to complain about ... except as mention in other reviews .. the portion is small.</li><li>It comes out to about 30 $ per person for a relatively small portion.</li><li>Try the $ 2 rice and chicken wings ( you get two wings with fried rice) Honestly some of the best Chinese food I have had and all for $ 5.19 per portion ( HUGE portion !!).</li><li>Soup was small portion, not as salty as in other places, tofu watery and surprisingly forgettable, a single big broccoli, nothing wowing there.</li><li>The portion was generous, but it is hard to choke down if it does n't taste good or like anything.</li><li>Also the portion is smaller than other places ( usually 2 bones instead of the standard 3 +) and they only give about 4 side dishes.</li><li>Do n't try other dishes like stirring fried vermicelli ( poor portion and bland, for all the Cantonese dishes, I recommend congee Wong nearby) or traditional Chinese dishes like fish flavoured pork slices ( 鱼香肉丝 ）, sweat &amp;
