( hero burger has the nerve to charge 38 $ for a burger and a veggie burger ALONE no fries or drinks) I 'm going tout on a limb and saying its the best Italian in the area.</li><li>The burger came with guacamole, bacon, onions, tomatoes, lettuce, a lot of cheese and a pickle .... the side was half onion rings half fries ( first time I ever see this kind of side at a pub ?).</li><li>My massive burger was only $ 12 !!</li><li>Definitely will come back to watch some games with friends and to try a burger too.</li><li>My burger had all of the major food groups: spice, cheese, veggies, bacon,

4.5.</li><li>I might return just for the prime rib burger or to watch a game inside ... likely wo n't go out of my way to come back however.</li><li>I ended up having a burger &amp; onion rings. both of which were really tasty.</li><li>$ 15 for burger and fries.</li><li>My burger was very nicely presented.</li><li>Management, if you 're going to change something as basic as the patty on your signature burger, put an insert in the menu!</li><li>It doesnt even taste like real beef, its very rubbery, and is n't how a burger should be made at all.</li><li>You might totally be disgusted like I was with the burger!: D Try it!</li><li>I always the the snail burger here- a burger with a hash brown- with a side of potatoes.</li><li>Classic example of putting too damned much on a burger.</li><li>By the time I was finished with the burger, it looked like I had washed my hands with grease.</li><li>Great patio, good service, good prices, amazing apps, and a disappointing burger.</li><li>I ordered a RIB/Brisket platter and my wife ordered a burger.</li><li>In addition to that my wife had not enjoyed her burger and had let the waitress know.</li><li>Ok, I do n't like you that much, but you 're a good choice when I 'm craving a big greasy burger.</li><li>I 'm annoyed at you though and you 're not the only fast-food chain I 'm annoyed at because you all claim to have a spicy, knock-your-socks-off burger.</li><li>You should really change the name of your Angry Whopper to `` Disgruntled Whopper'' or maybe `` Temper tantrum Whopper'' because the burger I had today definitely was not angry by any means.</li><li>It was pretty good as the burger was still rather juicy and thick, but it 's nothing like the wings.</li><li>The steam makes it appear larger than a dehydrated grilled burger would look like.</li><li>And a burger that was steamed as it 's preparation.</li><li>A juicy, tender burger inlaced with spices that when cooked became gently aromatic.</li><li>The burger and the shoestring fries are very good and it seems that the owners are trying to compete with the new Burger 's Priest next door!</li><li>Be warned that the burger and especially fries will be mysteriously extra soggy if you ask for takeout, so take the time to enjoy your burger right away!</li><li>Be warned that the burger and especially fries will be mysteriously extra soggy if you ask for takeout, so take the time to enjoy your burger right away!</li><li>The Prime rib burger was meh.</li><li>Order up: beef tacos, 3lbs of half jerk and mild wings, nachos, burger, 4 YES 4 large orders of Cesar salad ( insert ironic applause here), deep fried cheesecake, calamari, beer for the hubby and I and plenty of iced tea for the mini.</li><li>I ordered a small salad for $ 5 Canadian and the burger was advertised as $ 5 so I said okay.</li><li>The burger was very uneventful, cooked more than through, no fresh patty here.</li><li>Anyways the burger was remade but no bill deduction.</li><li>The only complaint I had was that something in my burger tasted like the freezer.</li><li>I love how unique the burger was.</li><li>I 've always wondered why in the cartoon the burger that Wimpy eats looks a little off kilter, now I know.</li><li>Your burger and fries are served up quicker than Harvey 's can slide one out.</li><li>While I ca n't vouch for the rest of Wimpy 's menu, the burger was surprisingly good.</li><li>But the burger for sure would have me back.</li><li>The burger was the best out of these things and even then it was a 6/10.</li><li>Would never ever ever even consider ordering food from this place again considering the whole ordeal cost me almost $ 40 and all I ate was the burger.</li><li>I could have gotten a $ 40 burger at a 5 star restaurant.</li><li>Additionally, last time I was there ( I 've been to this location twice) I got a burger and poutine to bring home for my roommate.</li><li>I live less than 10mins walk away, and as I was walking back the bottom of the bag suddenly ripped open and the burger and poutine fell onto the sidewalk.</li><li>Thankfully the burger stayed wrapped and the poutine container stayed closed.</li><li>Neither the burger or the poutine packages felt greasy, so either the bag was just not strong enough or one of the employees put the bag into water/grease/whatever before handing it to me.</li><li>A good burger ?</li><li>Aside from the `` usual'' burger, they have a few specialty burgers.</li><li>A bit on the pricy side for the burger.</li><li>I got their signature 4oz burger and a side of fries and a drink and it came to about 12 dollars.</li><li>My burger was cold, the cheddar cheese was not real cheese if you ask me ..</li><li>Would not recommend unless you want to get sick or get an alright but frozen burger.</li><li>Great burger and just about the best poutine.</li><li>I asked for hot sauce on my takeout burger and when I opened it up at home, there were literally 3 drops of hot sauce on the burger.</li><li>If you want a `` real'' and delicious burger, this is the place!</li><li>I always get the 6oz combo ( burger and fries) for lunch and it 's filling enough to skip dinner later.</li><li>Not a bad place for a burger.</li><li>Not bad for burger and fries.</li><li>I tend to come to joints like this for my burger cravings rather than the chains.</li><li>The burger is alright, they are factory made and come frozen.</li><li>If you 're looking for a homemade burger here, you 're out of luck.</li><li>It wo n't be the best burger you 've ever had but it gets the job done.</li><li>Nothing too great ... but the 6 oz homemade burger is heavy and fills you up and they make their toppings great ...</li><li>I have paid double for a burger that just tastes like cardboard .... so for that alone ... i will salute the Burger Hut for making a savoury burger when i really crave one.</li><li>I have paid double for a burger that just tastes like cardboard .... so for that alone ... i will salute the Burger Hut for making a savoury burger when i really crave one.</li><li>We appreciated that the burger was taken off our bill as we told them it was n't necessary ..</li><li>I think they could tell how much he did n't like his burger.</li><li>Servers are all very nice, happy to be there, ( and easy on the eyes I must admit) I had the burger and beer special.</li><li>The 8 oz. burger was grilled to perfection, served hot off the grill with all the fixings.</li><li>Ordered a veggie burger.</li><li>Asked me `` can we make you another burger ?''</li><li>Things may approve later, and you might have a better experience if you 're in no rush and only ordering a burger.</li><li>The burger itself was rife with taste and juicy.</li><li>The toppings for the burger were generous.</li><li>The burger does not come with sides and only lettuce and tomatoes.</li><li>I love this place but it seems to have changed hands because I 'm sitting here overhearing someone who seems to be the new manager entertaining the boys bellied up to the bar and the notion of turning it into yet another Irish pub. So long, best burger I 've ever had in Toronto along with food that actually has real flavour!: (.</li><li>It was n't a bad burger; the meat itself tasted only like cooked ground beef.</li><li>The burger was ho hum though a hefty patty cooked through all the way and was surprisingly cold.</li><li>Because apparently only their downstairs kitchen is capable of making a veggie burger.</li><li>For the price its fair trade, but the burger was dry, the fries were greasy, but a big portion.</li><li>Its just OK and thats the best i can say. for $ 10 i got what i would call a decent meal, its just that if i compare it to the burger i had on the weekend i would surely pick the other place if given the choice and i was in the area.</li><li>I got the junior burger melt ( crispy sandwich with melted cheddar, caramelized onions and burger), it was really good!</li><li>The burger and fries were okay.</li><li>Came in here a couple of weeks ago to order take-out as I was craving a burger.</li><li>Their burger tastes like a nice home-made style burger, it 's classical and leaves you feeling good about your selection.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
