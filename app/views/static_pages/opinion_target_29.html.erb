<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 29' %><h2>lunch<br />occurrence: 258</h2><div><ol><li>Do n't be fooled by the cheesy decor of this `` hole in the wall'' type of place, because I 'm telling you this is one of the best lunch spots ever and I frequent it on a regular basis.</li><li>Soly 's is an ok place for a quick lunch.</li><li>For lunch I usually have Salmon with steamed mushrooms and veggies.</li><li>It was more than edible but less than enjoyable ... all in all an ok lunch for under $ 10.</li><li>I used to LOVE going here, however today went to have lunch at the restaurant with coworkers and noticed that there was a bird flying over everyone while they were eating.</li><li>This place can fill up fast at lunch but since the service is usually quick, we 're typically in and out within the hour.</li><li>Great bento lunch and dinner choices at a very reasonable price!</li><li>There is a time and a place for when I want to spend more and get higher quality, but for a friday lunch, I will choose Sakura over many other places.</li><li>I 've visited ' The Sugar' four times over the past few years, most recently today for lunch.</li><li>I have been to The Sugar for dessert and dinner ( separately) in the late evening, for lunch on a weekend.</li><li>I 'll likely still come back here for lunch when I am in a pinch and until I find a better place to go.</li><li>Finally after 25minutes of wait ( reminder this is for lunch) with no tea or soup, I was able to place my order. somehow my waitress did not serve me tea-It 's something that comes with every Sushi restaurant so I didnt ask, after my sashimi got here with no tea, I could n't find my waitress again to ask her for it.</li><li>Will go again for a lunch.</li><li>Had a great lunch.</li><li>We also ordered the lunch `` Winterlicious'' menu.</li><li>I came here on a lunch break to do some stuff on my laptop.</li><li>I was pleasantly surprised by its quality when we stopped by for a quick lunch.</li><li>Decent price ( $ 15 AYCE lunch).</li><li>I had the lunch sushi and sashimi special and I thought it was great- all the pieces were fresh and proportions were big enough to fill me up for lunch.</li><li>For lunch I ordered the Sushi Lunch 11.</li><li>I used to come here quite often as I worked in the area, and the lunch sets are really good and good portion size.</li><li>One time they forgot the water and I had to ask someone else so that 's why I give it 4/5 but other than that good place! we stopped by for lunch today. the decor looked fancy, i like the environment. the price tag is a bit on the expensive side. you 're looking at 20-30 dollars easy per person. i do like their quality of food. we had some salmon and tuna nigiris and they were pretty fresh! the staff there are attentive. cute place! although this place was suggested by my cousin ( because his friend owns the place), i was unimpressed by their sushi/sashimi. it was n't fresh! yes, the place is nice, trendy and huge, but i would n't go here for their sushi.</li><li>I 've had lunch, dinner, and after work drinks.</li><li>Had this 8 dollar lunch bulgiogi bento and it was super delicious.</li><li>I 've been to this place several times now ( for both lunch and dinner).</li><li>The lunch boxes came with: salad ( dressing was really flavourful. captured fruity and Asian flavours), mashed potatoes with teriyaki sauce, corn, and spicy mayo, a gyoza, rice.</li><li>Overall, just a crappy experience. been here only few times and always for lunch. lunch options are very good and at least vegetarian options are pretty cheap ( tofu bento box + soup + salad = $ 7). the food is yummy! and they have some interesting appetizers like avocado tempura! which is just delicious! the staff is friendly and helpful.</li><li>I 'll admit the place is a bit pricey for a lunch -- Usually ends up being $ 35-40 per person, with no booze- But if you can write it off as a business expense, I encourage you to do so.</li><li>Not too bad for a lunch.</li><li>Great chicken sandwich and because I skipped lunch I bought a Hungarian salami sandwich ( I Mean you 're not going t buy Genoa salami at a Hungarian joint right ?</li><li>If you come for breakfast you get the same gargantuan portions you get for lunch or dinner.</li><li>The house special for lunch `` soup and sandwich'' $ 6.99 best deal in the area.</li><li>Decent selection of breakfast, lunch, dinner options.</li><li>A small little shop, so come early because there seems to be a line up here during the lunch hour rush.</li><li>My lunch stop today.</li><li>Cora supposed to offer a fabulous breakfast and lunch.</li><li>The line was long during lunch hour, and the counter where they cook and prepare the shawarmas is pretty much right near the entrance door, which makes it a bit of an inconvenience in terms of the line/getting in and out.</li><li>Good prices for a quick and tasty lunch.</li><li>I see myself coming back here, for casual lunch in the dinning area, sitting by the window and watch people walk on Yonge.</li><li>When six people go for lunch and all agree that the quality of the food has gone down hill to the point you would not go back if it were free, you know its bad. food okay but inconsistent in quality. sauces taste store bought. veggie spring rolls very bland.</li><li>Both times I tried their All You Can Eat option, once for lunch and once for dinner.</li><li>She and I had a meeting this afternoon in Concord and she suggested that we have lunch along the way at Island Foods at their Don Mills Road location.</li><li>Decided to check out their menu and tried them out for lunch.</li><li>Overall I would recommend them for a quick and cheap lunch, especially if you 're not watching your cholesterol levels.</li><li>There are 2 dishes I would recommend, 1. lunch special C, the vermicelli and beef skewers with a spring roll for $ 7.75 and/or 2. lunch special B, the lemongrass porkchop on rice ( it also includes a hot/sour soup) for $ 7.50.</li><li>There are 2 dishes I would recommend, 1. lunch special C, the vermicelli and beef skewers with a spring roll for $ 7.75 and/or 2. lunch special B, the lemongrass porkchop on rice ( it also includes a hot/sour soup) for $ 7.50.</li><li>Vietnamese Delight has a few ' lunch' specials ( available 11am- 5pm!) for $ 6.99 that include either soup or a spring roll but I opted to order from the main ' placemat' menu and had the Malaysian Curry Chicken with rice for $ 6.99.</li><li>Not perfect for business meetings as they get a bit noisy during lunch hour so they were busy but I will definetely come back.</li><li>ENVIRONMENT This place was actually packed on a Wednesday late lunch ( 1pm).</li><li>I 'd go back for a cheap, quick lunch but do n't think it 's like what you 'd get on the Danforth.</li><li>Speaking of the menu, it used to be a multi-page affair, with separate editions for lunch and dinner, upstairs ( upscale chop/fish house) and downstairs ( high-end bar food).</li><li>I 've been for dinner and lunch.</li><li>I 've never dined inside this location, the patio lunch was pretty much my first experience here ever.</li><li>Not cheap for lunch.</li><li>Everything else like the sushi, sashimi, chicken terriyaki were terrible in my bento box I had for lunch they did n't look or taste fresh.</li><li>We 're trying to have lunch, talk, and catch up.</li><li>I think my average lunch costs $ 5.65.</li><li>Had lunch here yesterday ( Aug 26/14).</li><li>We waited 25 minutes for our lunch to be delivered &amp; the restaurant was n't even busy.</li><li>They were not busy at all for a weekday lunch.</li><li>Our office is on Yong St north of Finch in City of Toronto and at least 12 times in any year we have either dinner or lunch at your restaurant at 5000 Yonge St Last Wednesday ( June 10th) my assistant made a reservation for 5.</li><li>Or a lunch.</li><li>I bet lunch should be lot more busier than dinner.</li><li>Usually fairly quiet at lunch during the week so a good choice for a business lunch.</li><li>I have had some moments when I was given the wrong fish, had to get my lunch to go because it took the food a long time to arrive and I 'm not crazy about the fact they stuff with spicy handrolls with loads of crunchy bits that quickly go soggy.</li><li>Not spectacular but a place I go to for a quick lunch.</li><li>Having just finished up a meeting, we went to this location for a quick lunch.</li><li>Quick lunch with my friend.</li><li>Why would the person serving lunch be eating lunch and the dining room is a mess ... ?</li><li>It seems that their main clients are surrounding businesses mostly for lunch.</li><li>The lunch and dinner scenes vastly differ, and once dinner rolls around, you can hardly recognize the place.</li><li>During lunch, they also have a take-out area, so people who work in or around the area can pick up lunch.</li><li>We smoked up before eating and we still could n't finish it plus enough for the both of us to take home for lunch.</li><li>Super fast service, great for a quick lunch.</li><li>The lunch is a great combo ... good &amp; cheap.</li><li>If I 'm coming back again, it would be for dinner because there is no sashimi for lunch.</li><li>I was living super close by when it first opened and I remember when AYCE was $ 14 at lunch ...</li><li>The price was n't bad for the amount of food you get during lunch.</li><li>For the price increase they should offer sashimi at lunch but they do n't.</li><li>I came for lunch with three others and although they had a decent variety, the quality was lacking.</li><li>I went on a sunday for lunch and didnt have to wait much for a seat.</li><li>The place looks fairly nice and the prices are pretty good for lunch.</li><li>I think lunch price was around $ 15.95 or so ?</li><li>The way they brought it was ridiculous, tiny portions at a time, so the lunch we had took about twice as long as it should have.</li><li>Also note they offer a buffet for around 9-11 $ for lunch.</li><li>Some colleagues and I suggested to go get some Pho for an early lunch.</li><li>Our office used to be located within walking distance of this restaurant and I would come here all the time for lunch and dinner.</li><li>Every time I go to do my weekly groceries at Loblaws ( Empress Walk), I stop by this place to have lunch.</li><li>Scrumptious food, nice manager, cute children, free wifi, food comes with drinks during lunch, lots of outlets to charge tablets and phones, very considerate restaurant!</li><li>Did n't end up spending more than $ 7-8 for lunch got almost half a pizza with a pop. Ca n't beat that.</li><li>We were intending to go someplace else for lunch but the kids feel asleep in the car so takeout it was!</li><li>My family frequently comes here for lunch and sometimes dinner.</li><li>A really cheap and satisfying lunch with leftovers to enjoy later.</li><li>I decided to give this place a chance after going to Congee Queen and finding out that it would 30 min wait till I could have lunch.</li><li>Beware the weekday lunch rush!</li><li>I 've come here a few times for dinner, lunch and take out.</li><li>The beef udon noodle meal took half an hour to come out as well which on a lunch when you 've only got 45 minutes to eat, is pretty brutal.</li><li>During lunch hours, they become quite busy and their kitchen slows down a lot.</li><li>We had lunch and all the dishes were tasty.</li><li>I had my heart set on falafel for lunch but my coworkers overruled me and we headed out for Thai.</li><li>My Gent &amp; I like to sneak away for quick lunch dates in the afternoons.</li><li>The prices for lunch are much higher than any other Japanese restaurant in the area, without any justification.</li><li>Ordered the lobster sashimi special, the unagi Don and sashimi salad, the sashimi salad was somewhat mediocre, lots of vegetables and not too much sashimi, the Unagi Don lunch special was tiny, and lobster sashimi was kind of too moist .. overall an average lunch experience.</li><li>It ai n't the west coast but it 'll do for dinner or lunch; I go here regularly, maybe too regularly. i remember in University we used to come here all the time, because the choices were either this ( and it was n't even that cheap) or sapporo sushi up the street.</li><li>The place is small so seating is a bit limited during the rush times like lunch and dinner.</li><li>Food is okay though not a large restaurant but if u are looking for a small lunch or dinner Thai bistro can be a choice.</li><li>Not a good place for a date or to enjoy atmosphere, it is best for take out or a quick lunch.</li><li>Good for casual weekday lunch.</li><li>For lunch they have a buffet but for dinner it is a la carte.</li><li>The portion is quite large and I always leave feeling stuffed and/or with a doggie bag of chicken to add to tomorrow 's lunch.</li><li>Went to Linda for a very late lunch a few days ago.</li><li>Best dish is the panang curry- Beef panang ( lunch and dinner portions are prepared differently- dinner is crispy), or my favourite, the Thai Islamic Noodles with shrimp and chicken.</li><li>We only had an hour for lunch, so we were pretty tight on time.</li><li>Had a very good lunch experience here.</li><li>If I 'm ever in Toronto again, this California girl is coming back to Katz. there pastrami/ corned beef is good, they stack em pretty high and just a lttle dry, cafeteria like, everything is ala carte, i usually get, a big pastrami sandwich on rye, fries and a piece of the rich chocolate cake, a vernors to wash it all down .... gets busy a lunch, plenty of seating, a bit expensive, last time i went $ 9 bucks a sandwich ( around there) ...</li><li>It might help to note that this TRIP was actually for a pre-dinner snack around 4pm so traffic and patrons were limited to a few as it 's neither the lunch or dinner rush that other reviewers have had their experience with.</li><li>I take friends by for a nice lunch, I especially like the tall glasses of un-sweetened Ice Tea.</li><li>For a lunch that cost me 17 dollars, in a canteen style restaurant, and to have attitude given to me over a 5 cent box, you bet I wont be back here.</li><li>If you are in the area, I definitely suggest coming here for their lunch !!</li><li>I have dined here twice with a friend, both times for lunch.</li><li>Other AYCE sushi restaurants will give you proper sushi and Miso Soup, for an even lower price ( 11.99 on most places for weekday lunch hours). bf and i came here last Sunday afternoon and had the gold menu for AYCE. it was less than average especially for the price, $ 21.99 on weekends and holidays and does not include drinks except for water and tea. this is the only AYCE place that comes out with our order of sashimi last. the most disappointing part was the food. salmon sushi were huge and sliced in cubes, steak cubes came in bits and pieces but was decent, buttered mushrooms were burnt, masago was too salty due to low quality, beef tataki was not fresh, i think the kalbi ribs were old cause they were so chewy i couldnt chew through them, spider roll was the worst! i couldnt even drink the tea cause the cups had such a strong bleach scent. needless to say, we will not be returning and would not recommend it to anyone.</li><li>It did n't occur to me that they had a lunch and dinner platter until as of recent and found that the ' small' fillet was really half of the large which really was n't much to begin with.</li><li>This place is located conveniently near my workplace, so I 've come here for lunch a few times and loved it!</li><li>Oh yeah, the servings are HUGE, but the leftovers are great for lunch the next day!</li><li>We had lunch there today, with:- Clam, Mustard Green and Salted Egg congee: this was decent without really standing out for me.</li><li>I visited this location today for lunch.</li><li>Great for lunch at time. yummmm !! def going back ... awesome hot and sour soup seafood fried rice and everything else ..:).</li><li>For Sunday lunch it is 90% full by 12:20.</li><li>Got there after a squash game with a buddy during that dreaded gap between lunch and dinner when many restaurants are closed, but not Congee Queen.</li><li>This place is great for lunch or dinner.</li><li>We had lots to take home for lunch the next day.</li><li>Great lunch and breakfast specials ...</li><li>I understand that it is the lunch rush but you would assume they would be prepared for it .. guess not.</li><li>Even when we were there for the weekday lunch, most of the patron 's in the pretty packed restaurant were non-Koreans.</li><li>Two portions for two people for lunch was more than sufficient, and even two portions for three people for dinner plus a side of dumplings was fine too.</li><li>I was pretty satisfied w/ the place and would recommend it for lunch.</li><li>I had lunch here yesterday, and it was pretty good.</li><li>Had lunch on a Wednesday.</li><li>Quick and efficient lunch for sure and you can even call ahead to place an order to avoid line ups and parking.</li><li>I tried the biang biang mian and pork jia mo for lunch.</li><li>But still a great choice for lunch.</li><li>I have had lunch any times at this restaurant and always enjoyed it.</li><li>This plaza gets insanely busy during the lunch rush so I would recommend going right before or after ( 11:30am or 1:00pm) lunch.</li><li>I would recommend you try this place for a casual lunch!</li><li>The prices are a bit high for lunch but for dinner, this would be a good option.</li><li>The atmosphere is awesome too- very cozy, and it is a perfect mix of restaurant and fast food which makes it perfect for lunch, and get together at night.</li><li>Since discovering it earlier this year, I have probably been here at least half a dozen times for brunch, lunch, and dinner.</li><li>We went during the lunch rush so the place was rather busy but not packed.</li><li>Decent place to have lunch but nothing very unique about it.</li><li>We were too full from lunch and did n't have room to try their crepes or cakes, so ca n't comment on those.</li><li>I 've been Pastel a few times for dessert but recently tried this place out for lunch.</li><li>Came here with a party of 2 after lunch on a Sunday.</li><li>Our server was delightful .. especially accommodating for a large group of 14 people having sunday lunch.</li><li>Their portions are reasonably sized and price for lunch.</li><li>Stick with the cheap beer for lunch.</li><li>The food Marche serves for appetizers and main courses for brunch, lunch and dinner are pretty good too!</li><li>All you can eat for $ 14 lunch.</li><li>Went here for lunch, which is the only time they have AYCE ... come on guys, you know this.</li><li>The food items for lunch AYCE was pretty decent and it good but nothing that stood out.</li><li>At just over $ 4 for a slice it 's an convenient choice for a cheap lunch.</li><li>Additionally, at lunch I 'll be standing and waiting for five minutes after placing my order and I 'll see it get flung down the heater tray and I 'll think `` Hey, at least it 's fresh''.</li><li>Overall the service killed the lunch.</li><li>We were seated between the lone other occupied table and a loud private room where a large group was finishing what appeared to be a cross between a business meeting and late lunch.</li><li>Have literally just finished my meal ( lunch).</li><li>Had the sashimi and nigiri sushi combo for lunch.</li><li>I got the lunch special today and had to throw it out.</li><li>Stopping in for a mid afternoon lunch, I had the sushi combo.</li><li>I had a good lunch here.</li><li>Yuki is one of the few affordable restaurants in the area, which is why it was crowded during lunch ( lunch specials till 4).</li><li>Full extra star for the service, and being a decent option for lunch in a neighborhood where you would not expect it.</li><li>I tried this place out for lunch.</li><li>- The lunch `` specials'' include large wings and fries for $ 13.95.</li><li>I would n't recommend eating a hot fudge dipped cone on a hot day, while on lunch at work, it can get very messy, very fast!</li><li>Did n't feel crowded for a weekday lunch.</li><li>Excellent local place for breakfast ( or lunch) ... standard as well as eclectic breakfast menu ... comfort-food type lunch menu.</li><li>Perplexingly ... not open for dinner or later ( makes no sense to leave the place dark after lunch ... costs have already been paid for).</li><li>Want to give it three stars as this place is pretty decent and the prices are great for lunch.</li><li>My lunch was $ 9.04 after tax.</li><li>Sashimi House has always served as a place for cheap but satisfying lunch.</li><li>Most people here for lunch are working in the area and the restaurant was half filled.</li><li>My friend told me that this place was great for lunch.</li><li>So understandably, it 's really cheap and worth it for lunch.</li><li>Casual place- great for lunch.</li><li>Seating was scarce at lunch but service was cray fast.</li><li>The service is fast and friendly, and the place filled up quickly during the lunch hour rush.</li><li>Teppanyaki Ume ( see picture) is a very good full lunch which includes soup, salad, shrimp appetizer, rice, veggies, chicken and steak.</li><li>Other times I 've been later to the table and the lunch has been very speedy.</li><li>I found lunch to be quite good.</li><li>I ordered number ' 51' which was a basic lunch at $ 11.</li><li>The nod meant that no one put anything extra in the school 's lunch.</li><li>A nice lunch option.</li><li>There were three of us for lunch.</li><li>I popped over to Fit for Life for a quick, light lunch ... right spot for a man on such a mission.</li><li>Some guy eventually showed up and started to put the blame on us saying that he cannot accomodate one client for lunch when everyone else is eating breakfast.</li><li>Ordered only three items as it was only two people dining for lunch.</li><li>Make sure you mix it all up before eating it and it does have quite a bit of garlic, so I would n't probably order it if you 're dining for lunch on a weekday.</li><li>Pricewise was a little pricey for lunch in my opinion.</li><li>I do believe they use the same menu for lunch and dinner, which would explain the dinner-like price point.</li><li>Mmmm ... lunch was over 4 hours ago and I still ca n't get over how good my wrap was.</li><li>Alas, I could not finish my lunch and had to take it away.</li><li>Lines can get a bit crazy during lunch hour so try to go a bit before or after.</li><li>Anyone who thinks it 's ' expensive' needs to pack a lunch.</li><li>I have been here many times for lunch.</li><li>The lunch is not that good unfortunately.</li><li>I was with my friends for a nice lunch.</li><li>This restaurant is near my work so I often come here for lunch and sometimes even dinner with my coworkers, friends, or my wife.</li><li>Service was super quick even during the busy lunch hours and the servers kindly gave you whatever sauce/dressing you wanted in a little tub.</li><li>Definitely a once in a while place to go to but youd lose too much money going there everyday for lunch.</li><li>Lunch special portions at $ 10 mean you can have lunch AND leftovers for dinner!</li><li>The prices are also ridiculously low for lunch.</li><li>That was $ 160, for 3 people, for a large lunch.</li><li>Quick lunch ?</li><li>Very satisfying. satay on the road has been one of my family 's favorite restaurants since i was a kid. i remember coming here when i was ten and ordering the same thing that i get now, ten years later: cashew nut chicken with an order of steamed rice and the shrimp chips with peanut sauce. first of all, the food tastes delicious. i think there 's been one or two times out of the hundreds of visits to this place where the food tasted a little spicier than usual but other than that, it 's been consistently amazing for close to a decade. i 've had cashew nut chicken at other thai restaurants and it just does n't compare. i ca n't speak about most of their other food but from what i 've experienced they 've been by far the best tasting thai restaurant in and around toronto. the wait staff is quick and friendly for the most part which is great. the atmosphere of the restaurant is nice ... they just re-did it and although i have to say i prefer the original decor which had an authentic thai feel to it, their modern, contemporary approach to their new `` look'' is very pleasing to the eyes and enjoyable to dine at as well. the value of the food is great. my girlfriend and i come here for their lunch special almost every week at least once and have a full meal with a drink that leaves us satisfied for both taste and hunger for usually under $ 10, 15% tip included. how can you beat that ? really. not to mention, you can order shrimp chips and peanut sauce as an appetizer while you wait for your meal, at no charge. i have yet to find another thai restaurant in toronto that has that. five stars to my favorite thai place since i was ten. i was happy to see that they expanded and opened another store on bayview. good for them!</li><li>Good if you work in the area and looking for a lunch.</li><li>I order through uber eats with them if I forget my lunch at work.</li><li>They dont let you get the lunch special if youre even a minute late.</li><li>The AYCE menu is very small for weekdays, even smaller for lunch.</li><li>Went for ATCE lunch on a weekday.</li><li>The lunch is amazing-delicious, fresh chicken with some parisienne potatoes and veggies, or rice.</li><li>We went back a few times for take out for lunch but then, disaster struck: they charged me for the bread.</li><li>Usually come in for the lunch special which is pretty good and economically priced.</li><li>Look- this place is $ 8 for lunch, taxes in.</li><li>But I would n't recommend this place for anyone not looking to get fired for an afternoon-long lunch break.</li><li>I 've come here several times for lunch.</li><li>I 've come back a few times after with other friends just for the lunch buffet after that.</li><li>Second chance has come and gone with their Mussels special for lunch.</li><li>Which was great as I was on lunch from work, and needed to be quick.</li><li>I do n't recommend Going at dinner or lunch because the food slides down.doiring dinner and sometimes lunch everyday they have specials that have not very good food for a decent price.</li><li>I do n't recommend Going at dinner or lunch because the food slides down.doiring dinner and sometimes lunch everyday they have specials that have not very good food for a decent price.</li><li>It 's an especially great place to get away from the York campus for lunch.</li><li>I would come back when I 'm in the mood for a relatively light lunch.</li><li>The place is n't too big and gets quite busy during lunch hours so go in the late afternoon ( lunch menu ends at 4pm by the way).</li><li>The menu looked good and we ordered lunch boxes which were ok.</li><li>We do n't come for the service but we do n't have to wait for a seat during the Sunday lunch hour so it 's bearable.</li><li>Their lunch and dinner looked fine from the tables around.</li><li>I came here yesterday with a coworker for a quick lunch.</li><li>My coworker simply ordered Chicken Fried Rice for lunch but I wanted to compare their bento boxes to those I 've had elsewhere so I opted for the Teriyaki Chicken.</li><li>My poor coworker, who does n't seem to have much lunch when coming out with me for Korean food, did n't like her rice at all and I must say, it did n't look overly appetizing either.</li><li>I enjoy the lamb, and I do recognize that all the meats are frozen ( what are you gonna do for a $ 12 lunch ?).</li><li>Great value ( for lunch).</li><li>Do n't think that I 'm willing to pay the dinner prices, but will definitely return for the weekday lunch ( $ 13.95).</li><li>I have been here for lunch a few times with groups from work and I think they have something for everyone- seafood, veg, different meats, styles and spice.</li><li>Great variety and price-quality is pretty good ( for lunch, dinner is more expensive).</li><li>Edit: price wise, this place is only worth it during weekdays for lunch ( 12.99 as of 2014), but I 'd probably not pay 26 for dinner at this place.</li><li>Went for lunch, was busy but never really waited on anything, not food or drinks.</li><li>My boyfriend and I decided to have lunch here.</li><li>Expect to wait if you arrive around dinner or lunch.</li><li>Other than that service is friendly and efficient, so it is ok to drop by for a late night snack or quick lunch, but my heart remains set on Congee Queen as it is really the queen of my congee.</li><li>I usually buy it for lunch and eat the leftovers for dinner.</li><li>Visit #3 and FINAL visit: I 've been back twice since the January lunch.</li><li>As too their lunch and dinner, it 's very good for their price.</li><li>Dropping by for lunch is always an option for me because it 's quick and delicious.</li><li>I ate half for dinner last night and half for lunch today.</li><li>Had lunch here last week for the first time.</li><li>Ordered over-medium once and received over easy, which was unappetising and went uneaten. ... love this mom and pops place! the staff is quite friendly and the owner always greets us personally whenever he 's around. i have personally only ever ordered from their all day breakfast menu so i ca n't speak for their lunch and dinner but it is the best breakfast at the most decent price. while i have ordered many breakfast dishes, my favorite go-to is the eggs benedict with smoked salmon and asparagus. i must have had this dish once a week for the past year and it 's been cooked to perfection every time. the sauce is not too heavy, not too light. the eggs are always made the way you like it- i make sure i get them to soft poach them. home fries are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. weekend mornings and brunch time get pretty busy but it is always worth the wait:).</li><li>Went here today for lunch.</li><li>We ordered Sapporo Miso Ramen, tonkatsu lunch and gyoza.</li><li>Belly Buster had a prominent role in my last year of high school: I 'd have a spare before lunch, pile into a car with a bunch of friends, and trek north to Belly 's.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
