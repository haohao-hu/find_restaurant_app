<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 5943' %><h2>coconut seafood<br />occurrence: 1</h2><div><ol><li>Crispy beef curry ( golden curry of course), traditional appetizer platter ( chicken lemon grass sausage-varies- sometimes yummy sometimes really dry, beef satay, and spring rolls are all well made), coconut seafood curry-wow but little pricey, the chicken &amp; vegs rice- you might feel it too sour but I like it- not the chicken though; the steak dish--good, crispy duck leg- no, etc., fresh, nice presentation, and more of the restaurant quality than the Thai eateries we usually go for pad thai, flat rice noodles, one plate meals, which are, obviously not Linda 's specialities either.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
