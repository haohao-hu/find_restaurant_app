<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 489' %><h2>Mango Sticky Rice<br />occurrence: 8</h2><div><ol><li>Usually, I 'm a huge fan of the Mango Sticky Rice, as I 've had it at another restaurant that is my all time favourite.</li><li>It came with some pieces of fresh strawberries and some crushed up peanuts on top of the mango sticky rice.</li><li>For dessert I had papaya ice cream because I was so full, and my girlfriend had the sweet mango sticky rice which was actually two small bits and not heavy looking at all.</li><li>The curry itself is amazing and not too spicy and the beef is tender on the inside and has a light crispy outside. i ca n't get myself to try any of the other mains! for apps i 've tried their mango salad ( note that there 's coriander in it, which I hate and mint leaves which I also do n't like), beef satay ( not bad), and their fried calamari ( I would get this again and loved the honey chili dipping sauce it came with). desserts I 've tried their mango sticky rice ( the mango was not sweet and really hard) and their deep fried banana with honey ( just standard). the decor here is super cool and there 's a nice patio area for the summer, I love this place!</li><li>He got the mango sticky rice ... uhhh it was ok.</li><li>I had the mango sticky rice for dessert but it was very sweet thus I poked at it a little.</li><li>DESSERT Mango sticky rice: It looked like 3 large scallops ( cylinders) on top of thin fresh mango squares and draped w/ coconut milk &amp; sesame seeds.</li><li>I mean, Pad Thai and mango sticky rice is pretty easy.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
