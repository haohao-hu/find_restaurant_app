<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 213' %><h2>noodle<br />occurrence: 30</h2><div><ol><li>The noodle is the dried type, but well cooked and tasted decent.</li><li>Then when the chicken is ready, the waitress would come and cut it up and serve that to you ..... then you wait again for the noodle to be cooked ... and she came back and serve you again .... then you wait for the congee to be cook, and now you have this congee that has all the nutrients from the chicken and ginseng that suppose to be really good for you ?!</li><li>I had the house special dry noodle ( H01 I believe) and it was a lot smaller than I thought it would be considering that it was $ 8.</li><li>The noodle was very soggy.</li><li>Ordered: Dak-Gal-Bee ( JS-1) 4/5* Chicken ( boneless dark meat) and assorted vegetables ( cabbage, sweet potato and greeon onion)* Choose your spiciness ( we went with B. The Joons Original Spicy Sauce)* $ 9.25 per portion ( 2 portions minimum), we ordered 3 portions for 3 people* Extra Add On: rice cake, mozzarella cheese, instant noodle, vegetables and fried rice* Extra add ons are all $ 2 except the fried rice* Everything is thrown together and comes to your table uncooked* Because it 's chicken, they take a while to fully cook and it drives you crazy* Servers will come around and cook them for you so do n't worry about the process* If you order mozarella cheese, they come midway and add it on near the end* For 3 portion order, I found there were n't much chicken* Original spicy sauce is not spicy at all !!</li><li>A bite of the Homemade Noodles at Chowon Family Restaurant and I knew that this is one of the best noodle I have!</li><li>Bajirak Kalguksu- Manila Clams Noodle Soup ( $ 7.99)- The noodle is the star!</li><li>I guess I need to come back to Chowon for that oh so good noodle!</li><li>The noodle was cooked just right, the soup spicy enough for `` a kick'' but notind numbingly so, and they did not skimp on the seafood, as many other places often do.</li><li>Pls just go to sunny supermarket to grab some instant noodle, which would be way better.</li><li>Overall the rice, noodle, dumpling, and bread-like dishes are very much Chinese style, but it does differ a little from mainstream Chinese cooking just to have its own unique taste.</li><li>Tasted ok but surprisingly lots of chicken and potatoes but very little noodle.</li><li>The broth was alright but the noodle wasnt the authentic type, it was the dried kind which was thicker and not as soft to eat.</li><li>While congee is a specialty, they offer a pretty wide range of food from noodles, some dim sum, and a variety of noodle dishes. + ives: price, quality, speed- ives: can be crowded, washrooms.</li><li>The noodle was cooked fine ( tender, but not soggy).</li><li>1.) no parking 2.) the chicken in our noodle tasted like they cooked last week and reheated ( awful) 3.) overpriced, you have to add many toppings because the one pan does n't come with anything.</li><li>As usual, I ordered this except this time the waiter told me in half-understandable English that I can only order one noodle, even if I want to pay extra for it.</li><li>The noodle itself is cold but the sauce is warm.</li><li>They have 2 different type of #noodles, the thin noodle is n't bad but their big flat noodle taste like boiled lasagne sliced in half.</li><li>However, this dish made me really appreciate the thick hand pulled ribbon noodles that artisan noodle is so known for.</li><li>Cold noodle ( $ 4.99): about average taste for cold noodle and under-sized and a little pricey ( later found that for $ 2 more, the Szechuan cold noodle is much better tasting and a much bigger serving; this was on my second visit) Lamb pao-mo ( $ 9.99) ( sweet potato starch noodles): the noodles are in a small, chunky form and the lamb and soup base were decent.</li><li>Great noodle.</li><li>Absolutely awful and uninspiring, the noodle does have big bowl, but minimal meat and potato cubes ( wtf ?) nothing special at all, Not fresh and tasteless ( it 's like having a mouthful of vinegar).</li><li>Trust me, the noodle was n't as spicy as it looked, so be brave.</li><li>I ordered the most typical dish stir fry beef noodle ( river noodle), they dont hv it.</li><li>When building your own noodle, you choose the type of noodle, broth, protein and vegetables.</li><li>I ended up getting the spicy seafood noodle soup because I enjoy chewy noodle- the owner assured me that the type of noodle used would be the chewy type.</li><li>They are famous for congee but the noodle, fried rice and other side dish are really worth to try.</li><li>The ginger flavor of the lobster meshed very well with the noodle, which sort of helped save the disappointing noodles.</li><li>The noodle here is ok, for texture and chewy wise not as good as Konnichiwa.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
