<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 7003' %><h2>`` pulled pork<br />occurrence: 1</h2><div><ol><li>Good:- Our server was attentive and pleasant, great job- Salad was reasonably fresh- Fries were pretty good Okay:- Wings were passable, certainly not `` best in the city'' as stated on the menu Bad:- Ribs ... like other reviews noted I 'm pretty sure they 're boiled, not smoked ... perhaps thrown into some sort of smoker briefly after they 're cooked but certainly not smoked over a long period of time, which is disappointing for a place with `` smoke house'' in its name- The chicken was dry and had very little taste, also not at all `` smoked'' like it says on the menu- The `` pulled pork'' was just ... wrong.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
