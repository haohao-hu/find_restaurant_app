<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 94' %><h2>patio<br />occurrence: 60</h2><div><ol><li>3) Summer they have a nice patio.</li><li>It is centrally located in the North York area and has a patio to sit out on in the nice weather.</li><li>Smokers are welcome but confined to the Pavement patio to supp and watch the world go by.</li><li>This place has `` patio'' seating, but it was in a mall ... WHAT 'S THE DEAL ? ll ForHellNo!</li><li>Overall, the patio was nice, the food fair, and the kids menu a home run.</li><li>Today, however, the sun was high and the patio was calling our name.</li><li>The place itself is tiny but does have a nice patio ( a little surprising for a breakfast bar).</li><li>I came with some of my friends on a Sunday afternoon/evening and we sat on the beautiful patio.</li><li>The patio, however, is my absolute favourite.</li><li>You definitely can hear Yonge street and it 's hard to ignore, but if you come at non-peak times, you can really enjoy the patio.</li><li>The best things about this restaurant is the set up and ambience, including the patio.</li><li>This turned out to be amazing- because their patio is awesome, and very, very large.</li><li>Miller Patio truly does have a great patio.</li><li>I 've never dined inside this location, the patio lunch was pretty much my first experience here ever.</li><li>The patio is one of the better ones I 've ever been on.</li><li>The patio feels less like a bar patio and more like a deck in a wealthier friend 's backyard.</li><li>The Miller Tavern uptown ( which, once upon a time, was called the Jolly Miller) is kinda neat, insofar as it 's a tavern ( the bar area has lots of TVs to enjoy sports) but it 's also a semi-upscale steakhouse, with a great big patio to boot.</li><li>We would have liked sitting on the patio, though.</li><li>Awesome butter chicken- great patio in the summer- I love places that invest good money in huge hanging flower baskets, it makes all the difference.</li><li>Great patio too, somewhat hidden from busy Yonge Street.</li><li>They also have tons of seating areas two levels of indoor dining with a couple private rooms, a huge outdoor patio and a nice upstairs patio as well.</li><li>The waiter even said we could sit there after they closed if we walked out via the patio.</li><li>Lunch breaks on the patio are a nice treat.</li><li>Has a nice looking patio, and the inside looks good but place is super dusty, could use a good dusting before customers come. do n't waste your time like I did, worst pizza experience. yesterday I ordered a medium pizza with two dipping sauce, they had a% 50 percent deal going on so the total came up to $ 13. the pizza came OVER 2 HOURS later !! also the pizza was cold, it was n't even cut and they forgot my dipping sauce. the worst part was I called the store several times and every time it went to voicemail. the driver said he would pay for my next pizza if I call the next day and just explain what happened. when I called today the lady on the phone said the best she can do is give me% 75 off my price that I paid yesterday so I would pay around $ 3. when the pizza came this time the driver had a different price then what was told to me.</li><li>Pros Service was quick Has TV 's on patio Lobster Poutine Appetizer ( $ 10) was great for two people Cons Drinks did n't taste good, we had the Tropical Sangria $ 9 and James 'son $ 8.</li><li>The patio is n't of much use as it faces Yonge Street, which is like a highway in this part of the city and is really loud.</li><li>I 'd definitely go back to this restaurant again to try out their other menu items. family owned italian restaurant. short summary: very yummy food, portions could be bigger, sometimes slow service but very friendly lady owner, always packed at lunch, which is frustrating since they dont accept reservations. longer summary: the decoration of the restaurant is very cozy and gives a feeling of a patio dining even though it 's all indoors. the service though slow is very friendly and we often end up chatting with the owner for few minutes while we 're waiting for the order. it usually gets very packed at lunch by the people from surrounding office buildings. and since they do n't accept reservations sometimes it means that you have to arrive right after the doors are open ( which is 1130am everyday I think) in general very welcoming place but a bit on a pricey side.</li><li>There 's a nice cozy patio to enjoy your eats.</li><li>The patio is a plus though this stretch of Yonge at the 401 is especially loud.</li><li>The patio is nice but it looks out to barren dirt fields of Keele and Finch.</li><li>Nice patio in the summer and lots of free parking.</li><li>Looks as though the patio will be a nice place to hang out once the weather gets better and better.</li><li>Service was spotty though as the place was packed and I sat at the corner of the patio.</li><li>Though the patio seemed somewhat oddly positioned in relation to the restaurant, the clear glass panes meant lots of sunlight if you are into that kind of thing.</li><li>They have a really nice patio that was added a few years ago, and the smallish bar area with the TV is always a good place to watch a game.</li><li>I think the interior is decent and do like the renovations for the patio that was done recently.</li><li>The patio for barbecue was Really Awesome !!</li><li>Verdict: ~ Everything is as good as always, there 's a reason I have been coming back for years. ~ My faves are the Pork Belly BBQ, the Kang Poon Kee ( Spicy Fried Chicken) &amp; Jook Sam Kyup Sal, especially with the added rice at the end. ~ Ca n't wait to come back for patio season.</li><li>This little caf√© on Yonge and Finch looks big on the outside, as they do have a patio, however there are only about 3 booths inside as the rest of the space are being taken up by their display and cashier spots.</li><li>A bonus is that they have a patio- definitely nice during warmer weather.</li><li>Not really knowing that area, the location was really easy to find, and the patio was really spacious and relaxing.</li><li>Great patio, good service, good prices, amazing apps, and a disappointing burger.</li><li>Patio is nice in the summer, but sometimes the server disappears and you 're left stranded.</li><li>If there 's a big Chuck-E-Cheese party parking can sometimes be a pain but it 's a big lot, only a real issue when it 's raining/snowing and you do n't want to park far away.- the patio is cute in the summer but you 're basically sitting on the curb looking at the parking lot.</li><li>It looks like they have a patio but was not set up for the season yet.</li><li>The patio is pretty bad given that it rests right over the TTC subway grates of Sheppard Station.</li><li>Another big problem is that they were letting people go out and smoke on their patio but as people came and went gusts of smoke would filter into the room ( including one fellows stanky cigar aromas).</li><li>I would definitely come back in the summer when the patio is open!</li><li>Parts of the patio are shaded.</li><li>We waited about 10 minutes to be seated on the patio while three staff members stood in front of us talking.</li><li>The patio does looks promising at this newest Symposium on Sunny afternoon.</li><li>On that note, love the patio they have for summer- my friends and I came here close to midnight, and the temp was humid-y so we decided to cool down with shakes and a banana split.</li><li>Their patio is pretty awesome.</li><li>I will come back once the patio is opened to enjoy my 2 favourite summertime activities- chilling and people watching!</li><li>We will be back, although the patio is a little noisy.</li><li>Great atmosphere for afternoon drinks, espcially the patio.</li><li>Especially much more fun on the patio in summer.</li><li>They 've also got a nice patio upstairs on the second level which is pretty appealing in the summer months.</li><li>The place has 2 floors and a patio in case it starts getting all claustrophobic up in there.</li><li>It was a beautiful day so we were fortunate to be able to get a patio seat.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
