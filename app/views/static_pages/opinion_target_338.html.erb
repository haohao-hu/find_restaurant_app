<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 338' %><h2>chicken pad thai<br />occurrence: 15</h2><div><ol><li>The trouble came when my other friend decided he wanted some chicken pad thai.</li><li>I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai which was definately tasty and a ginger ale.</li><li>I ordered a classic chicken pad thai.</li><li>We had Vegi Spring rolls and the Chicken Pad Thai, which seemed to be house favourites based on the constant stream of phone calls ordering it for takeout.</li><li>Chicken pad thai was good in portion and flavour.</li><li>We got the chicken Pad Thai first which the BF liked the best.</li><li>I probably should have left him alone, but I saw them preparing a take out order ( me and my coworker were the only ones there waiting for food), and it was n't what either of us had ordered, so I asked to confirm while there was still time for them to fix it ( chicken pad thai could sound like chicken fried rice ...).</li><li>I asked for a chicken pad thai, forgetting to indicate the chili level and proceeded to ask you what the difference was between the green and yellow curry.</li><li>A regular chicken pad thai and a thin clear seafood noodle dish.</li><li>Chicken Pad Thai: It was wrapped in a paper thin omelet instead of having egg tossed w/ the pasta.</li><li>My friend ordered the Chicken Pad Thai, and that dish I have to admit from what I tasted was somewhat disappointing.</li><li>But what really did them in was that one time my order of Chicken Pad Thai that took 30 minutes ( and I was in a rush) got 2 thin slivers of chicken.</li><li>The next time I went, I told the server about my previous experience and continued to order the Chicken Pad Thai.</li><li>I had the chicken Pad Thai, which was pretty tasty and had plenty of meat added.</li><li>One order of Chicken Pad Thai took almost an hour to make when the place is clearly meant to be a grab and go place .. it was also strange because out of everyone I went with, we all got our orders at different times when we originally placed the orders one after the other.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
