<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 72' %><h2>oil<br />occurrence: 87</h2><div><ol><li>I have been at this place for past few days and simply its the worst experience. the first day I got my gyro order on toasted white bread with no sauce or any other form of toppings !! when I complained to server and ask if I coukd see the manager `` I was told that there is no manager at this place and the owner is running the place'' AND OF COURSE THE OWNER WAS NOT AROUND. on second visit I ordered the bruschetta dish, no basil or olive oil was used !!!!</li><li>Cazuela: typical Chilean bowl 1/5 soup, rice veggie, meat all in one served in a large soup bowl, with coriander, and herbs. the Stock was exceptional, however they use a lot of oil in their cooking.</li><li>Always good with special requests ( e.g. no MSG, little oil, no sugar, etc)- combo entrees come with a variety of drinks, their milk tea is my go-to- staff/owners are usually friendly ( the guy wo n't let you leave once you get him started).</li><li>I do n't think you could have salvaged them even if you recooked them in the most unhealthy oil imaginable topped with ketchup and salt.</li><li>3 of their salmon sashimi = 1 salmon sashimi anywhere else. all the fish were so thin it looked like oil soaked through a piece of paper. the whole meal is smaller than the size of my fist ... and over half of it was white radish used to fill and prop up the transparent fish. after you calculate everything .. you totally lose.</li><li>Just pour yourself a pitcher of vegetable oil and down that instead.</li><li>Maybe using a cheaper oil or something, I ca n't seem to pin point it.</li><li>Most grocery staples available and always a large variety e.g. bread/hard bread, rice, oil ( not sure about milk, butter or cereal besides oatmeal).</li><li>The two pastas, one with oil, the other with a light tomato sauce, were good, if a little heavy.</li><li>The lamb pasta was so badly done, the dish was almost like a microwaved dinner; the meat was chewy, the pasta was disproportionately cold and hot, and the residual oil was overwhelming to my palette.</li><li>I do sometimes get hungry an hour or two after eating their food, which probably means they use less oil and grease than other places- a good thing, to be sure!</li><li>At the bottom of the rice was a full layer of oil.</li><li>Here is my experiance: Chilli chicken with gravy: If I would of known that the gravy is mostly of oil, I would of avoided this dish.</li><li>Has some flavors but the oil is overpowering.</li><li>CRISPY GINGER CHICKEN: Deepfried chicken that has soked up a good quantity of oil, which again is tossed in a wok with oil and other components.</li><li>CRISPY GINGER CHICKEN: Deepfried chicken that has soked up a good quantity of

paste is not how it is done.</li><li>Waited 30 minutes for two pupusas and 40 minutes for ceviche and yuca con chicharon, the yuca and chicharon was probably fried with old oil.</li><li>Guess they do n't skimp out on the oil.</li><li>I looooooove thai food ... not in spring rolls though ... it 's ok to come here for food on a lunch break maybe or while waiting for the movie at the cinema ... but not the ultimate food destination. what makes me put 2 starts is not even quality or authenticity of food but the smell of fried cheap oil that surrounds this restaurant whenever you pass it on the street ... there is also a hint of that smell inside in some parts of the restaurant ... other spring rolls locations would probably get a higher rating from me.</li><li>The Shanghai fired noodles was too soggy and drenched with too much oil, and the pan fried onion cake was just so wrong.</li><li>The spring roll is crispy without being drenched in oil.</li><li>Tasteless, watery and full of oil.</li><li>The nihari was covered, immersed in oil, more oil, less curry, clumps of starch powder, and chunks of fat in lieu of meat.</li><li>To me, it tasted as though the oil the fish was fried in needed changing.</li><li>Yes, the place could go through some much needed renovations, make that the whole plaza in fact, but the history of batter and cooking oil have left their mark on these walls.</li><li>It remains crunchy, with a well cooked fish, not over fried, in nice clean oil.</li><li>The fries seemed to be fresh cut but more importantly did n't pick up any fishiness so either very clean oil or seperate fryer.</li><li>Golden crispy ... really fresh frying oil !!- yes it is oily ... hey it is deep fried in oil but it is worth the extra calories! and deep frying fish is not as bad as chicken with skin in term of fat content- Chips are not bad .. but quite standard ... at least they are fresh, made to order !!</li><li>Golden crispy ... really fresh frying oil !!- yes it

at least they are fresh, made to order !!</li><li>This restaurant has less salt and less oil if you such ordered.</li><li>Stale bread, nasty, dirty looking oil + balsamic dispensers ...</li><li>I just hope they do not add so much salt and oil to the dish in the future.</li><li>Grilled items are extra heavy on the oil.</li><li>Food was pretty bad, and it had a lot of oil.</li><li>He 's Bangladeshian and loves this place because of their oil stick wrapped with rice crepe.</li><li>We asked for less salt and less oil.</li><li>Spicy chilly oil is added near the end to further enhance the flavor.</li><li>The Parmesan chicken was fried in heavy oil, more so than what I would like.</li><li>It comes with linguine and tomato sauce on the side, and some carrots/broccoli/cauliflower with garlic and oil.</li><li>I ordered some rigatoni with sundried tomatoes, olive oil, rapini and olives.</li><li>That was n't enough to endear me --- because there were service issues, and I became sick later that night because the crispy duck was clearly fried in the same oil that shrimp is fried in because staff did n't consider that.</li><li>The tofu was super greasy, not puffy, and oil oozed out of it when biting it in half.</li><li>I do n't recommend getting anything fried as the oil tasted old.</li><li>I had the snow shoot vegetables ... usually when you order this dish- they fry it in oil and garlic.</li><li>The tempura chef did an amazing job because some places drown the shrimp, causing it to soak up the oil which does not make for a delicious treat.</li><li>They also have a hot plate option, it 's the oily Biang Biang noodles, I 'm guessing they will pour the heated oil to the noodles ?</li><li>The hubs actually added extra spicy oil from a nearby metal condiment container to feel any heat ( and medium level spice is usually his maximum).</li><li>The bottom crust of the pork jia mo was just drenched in oil which was unappealing.</li><li>My primary issue with this place is the amount of oil in the soup.</li><li>Or you get your hands messy from the oil and sauce.</li><li>To sum it up: the pasta dish was tasteless and drenched in massive amount of oil.</li><li>I threw it out because there is no point in eating bland pasta that is covered in oil.</li><li>Like my pasta was legit swimming in a big ol ' pool of oil.</li><li>My only concern was the amount of oil in the dish as the pasta was drenching in oil.</li><li>My only concern was the amount of oil in the dish as the pasta was drenching in oil.</li><li>They were generous with the oil ( I poured off at least 2 tbls) which is considered a good thing to Pakistanis but not for my waist line.</li><li>I mean it was good, just not excellent. it also came with a side salad that was dressed simply with oil and vinegar, a really nice touch. then we got the black sesame crepe for dessert, and let me just say, the ice cream is KILLER. you can taste the homemadeness of it. the whole thing was sprinkled with roasted peanuts and toasted oats ( kinda like granola) that added crunch. it was fairly big, pretty damn good, and the presentation was frickin sexy. i 'll definitely be back, but maybe next time I 'll only go the dessert route.</li><li>Unfortunately, a lot of the oil from the pan made its way to the plate so the bottom half of the crepe got kind of soggy.</li><li>- Chicken fried rice turned into fried rice with chicken on top COOL BUT the rice was very moist in oil.</li><li>Had noticeable oil, but not as much as Pizza Hut.</li><li>The salad was covered in very unpleasant oil which made that not eatable.</li><li>Except the bacon which had the test of burnt oil.</li><li>Food ( Grill): The grill course is rather filling which is good actually, but do prepare for a sodium and oil bomb- skip the bacon breakfast if you are there for the grill.</li><li>Price is reasonable, and the staple gamjatang ( which thankfully has no staples!) will always feature meat which can slide off the bones ... and noticeable amounts of oil.</li><li>Got the bulgogi which was soggy and drenched in oil.</li><li>I am not a fan of the loud Korean pop music, the tap water served in aged plastic bottles, the sticky tables and the heavy use of oil in pretty much all their dishes.</li><li>Although the fries and gravy were to my satisfaction, the Eggs &amp; Grilled Cheese had oil dripping from it!</li><li>Seemed like everything was cooked all together and looked like the oil has been reused.</li><li>Too much oil and the ham was like gum!</li><li>The wings are then deep fried in vegetable oil and served to you piping hot.</li><li>Although there were a variety of vegetables ( green beans, carrots, etc.), they were covered in an excess of oil.</li><li>I found the veggies coated with oil.</li><li>Personally I do n't like a lot of oil on my vegetables so I ask for them to go easy on the oil However, I do enjoy the food here a lot and would recommend it but make sure you get your wrap to your liking and ask for additional toppings if desired.</li><li>The oil was a tad old.</li><li>Not tender and the skin were tough- Deep fried Shrimp Dumplings though is L but fresh shrimps and not oily even it was fried in oil- Beef Balls- Steamed Beef Ribs- Sai Mui- Steamed bun with Sesame and Egg Yolk ( the to order item in the menu)- Durian Tart !!!</li><li>The baked beans were also cold with oil floating on top and the coleslaw was drenched in white vinegar.</li><li>Be prepared to smell like oil and food after your meal!</li><li>The fried calamari are very dark, perhaps for not changing the oil recently.</li><li>Pick your meat ( pork, lamb, beef, chicken or several different kinds of seafood), veggies ( plenty of options), noodles ( 3 varieties) and sauce ( large selection of pre-mixed or create your own) and hand your bowl to the cook who has it ready for you in a minute or so after tossing it around on a huge hot plate with no oil, just water.</li><li>If you 're like me and love stir steamed veggies ( like stir fry but without the oil).</li><li>I choose my own amount of garlic, pepper, no salt, sesame seed oil, spring onion, parsley.</li><li>They really listen to your instruction. ie: separate the sauce from noodles, less oil, etc.</li><li>Not much oil was used.</li><li>I do n't think the flavours are really there and that the oil they use is not the best.</li><li>Its centre is filled with olive oil and spices.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
