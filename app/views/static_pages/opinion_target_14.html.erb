<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 14' %><h2>rice<br />occurrence: 447</h2><div><ol><li>Mt girlfriends family has made a tradition of going here every year for dinner on New Years Day ( why we keep going when one of the kids got their meal AFTER everyone else ate last year) Anyways, I tried a few things on the menu until I came across the souvlaki ( the meat, veg and rice was nothing special, but wow did I ever fall in love with the dressing on the Greek salad).</li><li>Bistec carne frita: Typical Chilean dish, served with flavorful rice, beef steak, veggies.</li><li>Overall 2/5 portion was good, price, and taste of the rice was lovely, the beef was a bit bland, and presentation was satisfactory.</li><li>Like most sushi restaurants they have lunch deals -- which are bento boxes of your typical beef, chicken or salmon teriyaki meat, rice, salad, soup &amp; fried tempera.</li><li>The noodles and rice were cooked to perfection.</li><li>The rice was ... long grain, loose, not hot enough and not flavorful.</li><li>I usually order the combo specials ( $ 6.99ish depending on whether you want rice or noodles and such) which included a bubble tea and a small dessert.</li><li>Interesting combination, but the yellow fried rice with scallions and strips of beef also in made it some of the best rice I 've ever had.</li><li>Tempura Combo ( $ 10.95)- Miso Soup/Salad and Shrimp Tempura, 5 pcs Sushi and 6 pcs Chef 's Choice Roll- My Shrimp and Veggie Tempura arrived in a bento box with salad, rice, gyoza and some fried items on the side.</li><li>My sister got the Beef Teriyaki Bento which included miso soup, salad, rice and sweet/sour chicken.</li><li>I got the Bulgogi Bento which included miso soup, salad, rice, salmon rolls and sushi.</li><li>My mom did like the rice though,,,,,, I guess something was salvageable ......</li><li>The best way to order is to get a sandwich and split a large greek salad with whoever you 're with, as I prefer the salad to rice and potatoes.</li><li>I got Combo #1: 1 dish, 1 rice and a drink.</li><li>We also shared some ground meat kebobs, rice and salad ( $ 8) and a potato bolani ( $ 2.50) from Bamyan ( Afghan).</li><li>The rice was long grained with carrots and raisins and spiced to perfection.</li><li>The rice also had a strange quality to it and was very offputting.</li><li>The grilled tomatoe and rice on the other hand were perfect.</li><li>This came wit delicate rice and a salad with the nicest dressing we 've had in some time!</li><li>The rice was also on the dry side.</li><li>$ 5 for Three kinds of meats, rice or noodles, and soup.</li><li>They tasted fine and the rice with the Chirasu was quite good, but the portions were disappointing.</li><li>Cause the rice mountain they used on the thininst of salmon slices.</li><li>You can choose from your sashimi, maki rolls, tempura, cooked items, rice, noodles etc.</li><li>And the rice has a very common taste, while the good Japanese chirashi don pays great attention to the quality of rice.</li><li>And the rice has a very common taste, while the good Japanese chirashi don pays great attention to the quality of rice.</li><li>I enjoyed the taste of this roll, but the rice makes me wonder whether I 'd ever get it again.</li><li>Again with the mushy rice.</li><li>Ironically, this rice was considerably more like sushi rice than the rice they used in their rolls.</li><li>Soggy rice.</li><li>Maybe today was an off-day but I came here expecting to eat sushi and I was highly disappointed by the mushy warm rice which then made the nori chewy and not crunchy.</li><li>Most grocery staples available and always a large variety e.g. bread/hard bread, rice, oil ( not sure about milk, butter or cereal besides oatmeal).</li><li>The rice was n't rubbery.</li><li>I ordered 2 things: Sashimi Dinner ( $ 19.99) that includes 18 pieces sashimi, rice, soup, and salad and 2 pieces of Otoro sushi ( $ 19.99).</li><li>The bottom piece of fish plus the rice itself could have been a piece of nigiri sushi by itself probably, but somehow they chose to layer on top another piece of fish.</li><li>The fish were high quality and fresh, the rice was a good portion relative to the size of fish, and the maki were well made and delicious.</li><li>The maki rolls arrived and were reasonably portioned without overloading the rice.</li><li>Woah I 'm stuffed. the manager and servers are very friendly and attentive. we tried toro ( bluefin tuna) sashimi, and it tasted so good. it 's just very pricey ( $ 19.95, usually $ 24.95). i ordered chirasu lunch ( rice with various kinds of sashimi) as main course and all the sashimi were very fresh and well served. would definitely go back there again to try their sushi combo.</li><li>The lunch boxes came with: salad ( dressing was really flavourful. captured fruity and Asian flavours), mashed potatoes with teriyaki sauce, corn, and spicy mayo, a gyoza, rice.</li><li>The shushi portion on the rice was paper thin, and my seaweed salad had hair in it !!!</li><li>Although the portions do n't seem large, the amount of protein and carbs you get from the healthy serving of rice and meat, fills you up a lot faster than you originally think.</li><li>The business motto of the owner is great, they cook a large quantity of rice and meat in the morning.</li><li>The jerk is perfectly marinated, the rice is flavourful, and the sauce is plentiful.</li><li>The chicken kabob and chicken doner both were so tender and they came with rice and grilled veggies.</li><li>I had a kebab plate with rice and salad and `` Ayran'' ( yogurt based drink).</li><li>I 've had their schwarma and kabab time special which comes with a assortment of meats and rice and salad and bread.</li><li>Overall though the rice and the entree were on the savoury side.</li><li>The menu does n't have an extensive selection of meals as other Viet restaurants but they do have the basics of spring rolls, pho ( beef and chicken), pho beef stew, rice and noodles.</li><li>The rice itself was not dry enough ( as in not enough wok heat).</li><li>I will ( hopefully) never get rice from here ever again.</li><li>Came here today for lunch and ordered S1, the whole chicken with stuffed ginseng, rice, dates, and other nuts and herbs.</li><li>She got a new set of utensils and broke the chicken into pieces, and mixed it with the soup, rice and noodles.</li><li>A lot of choices for bibimbap &amp; ginseng chicken soup ( with a small bowl of noodle) The pork cutlet on rice is surprisingly good, highly recommended The plaza has a lot of parking Service is friendly The overall dinner is very entertaining Will definitely come back and try their seafood pancake Have hot stone beef.</li><li>They specially in samgaetang which is a special healthy and delicious chicken soup ( with rice and noodles) but my boyfriend is obsessed with the spicy pork which is served sizzling on a hot plate with rice and side soup.</li><li>All of the main dishes come in a hot stone bowl and the rice is super crispy in my bibimbap!</li><li>With both rice and japchae in the hot stone pot, the food stayed nice and hot while offering a good amount of food to fill you up.</li><li>Order the blood sausage soup, it came with rice.</li><li>At the bottom of the rice was a full layer of oil.</li><li>Inside the chicken is some stuffing consisting of rice, a date, and a small piece of ginseng.</li><li>I 've never experienced this, but although the stone pot for my bibimbap was hot, the rice did my even stick to the pot to create that slight crust of rice this dish is known for.</li><li>Very flavourful, perfect with plain rice.</li><li>I 'd recommend trying everything with plain rice, to get the true flavour, uncomplicated by the seasoning in the noodles.</li><li>The quality is good and the rice is fresh and tasty.</li><li>Ordered: Gae-Jang ( marinated raw crab) 2/5* Plate of marinated crab for $ 12.99* You can order soy sauce based or spicy sauce based* I ordered soy sauce based Gae Jang* Basically you get 2 small crabs all cracked up* Soy sauce marinade was decent but a little too sweet* What turned me off from this is how the crabs did n't taste very fresh* Although it is marinated, because you are eating this raw- freshness is quite important* My mouth felt a little dry/tough after eating this and it was n't very pleasant* The claw part was n't cracked and there was no way I could break it with my teeth* I was quite disappointed with this dish since I was looking forward to it Ordered: CheolPan JjooGgooMi ( baby squid stir fry) 5/5* Baby squid stir fried with vegetables and ricecake for two people at $ 19.99* This was recommended by my friend who 's had it before* It 's meant for 2 people and cooked at your table* This is very spicy ( be aware !!)* It came with lots of baby squid, ricecakes and vegetables* Sauce was very intense in flavor ( spices) and it was good to eat with rice* I thought it was kind of odd how they had broccoli in it* I loved this dish and would go back just for it Complimentary: Kong Bi Ji* This is a grinded up bean paste that people like to eat with the rice* I am not a big fan of beans .... or grinded up beans so I did n't really enjoy it* But my friend said it was really good!</li><li>The taste was a little bit to salty, it is great if you have it with rice.</li><li>Gen was a big fan of the special soy sauce blend and taught us to eat it by taking some of the rice and putting it into the shell of the crab in order to use up the soy sauce blend.</li><li>The rice really went well with the soy sauce blend as well.</li><li>The crabs were quite salty, I recommend eating it alongside rice.</li><li>With the sauce, I finished all my rice ( I usually do n't eat rice).</li><li>The menu said the carne asada just came with rice and salad but I was pleasantly surprised to find beans, tortilla and plantains with the meal.</li><li>The guys behind the counter here are pretty generous with the amount of rice, vegetables ( e.g. lettuce, pickel, onions, beets), and chicken they pile on your plate.</li><li>The two stars are for him:) The shawarma was not seasoned well and the rice was horribly waterlogged.</li><li>I ordered their famous chicken shawarma plate, very very generous portion, included were chicken, rice, salad and sauces, like others said they dont skim on anything including the shaved chicken!</li><li>There was just the right amount of sauce so the rice was n't soaked.</li><li>I thought service was ok. disgusting. absolute shit. it taste horrible and the amount of rice they put on sushi to make you full faster ... and how thin their sashimi is ... oh did i mention that its overpriced ? the waitress is an asshole with attitude ... the manager is an asshole with attitude. horrible service. you have to pay extra for parking as well ... they wont validate it for more than an hour even though they take forever to make their food. i swear they do that on purpose ... fucking ridiculous.</li><li>Anyway, the AYCE menu is amazing because, surprisingly, they have GOOD sushi with very little rice and a lot of stuff.</li><li>Red Thai Curry is tasteless, too spicy, and entirely bland with mushy rice and dried up, fried, spongy tofu.</li><li>It was dry and the rice did not have much flavor.</li><li>Their `` Special'' Fried Rice arrives in a Styrofoam container, ( that was squished the last time), but still full to busting with what appeared to be pieces of everything imaginable from the kitchen mixed with the rice.</li><li>I ordered the 12-piece Sashimi lunch special for an incredible $ 10.99; it came with a side of rice, noodles, two dumplings and the usual miso soup and salad.</li><li>The few times I had rice the pork chop was kinda burnt.</li><li>It was not bad: the chicken was moist and tasty ( even better with the gingery dipping sauce) and the rice could have been more flavorful but ok.</li><li>Their other dishes such as the rice and bun ( Vermicelli) is also awesome at this location.</li><li>The rice takes a tad longer but I mean, still relatively fast compared to other non-pho restaurants.</li><li>I 've also tried some of the rice and meat dishes, equally good and present a great value.</li><li>The rice is so fluffy and delicious, I 've never had rice like this before.</li><li>I always happen to order of filet de pescado ( fish fillet) that comes with a side of rice, salad, and sliced plantain chips.</li><li>Not a fan of the noodles or the rice but the veggies and plantation bananas are all right I guess ( I 'm a carnivore to the core so if it is n't meat it 's a distraction anyway).</li><li>I got a combo 1- rice and peas and a chicken leg.</li><li>While we were paying, I asked my girlfriend if this would be enough food for us since we were sharing, the lady overheard and offered to give us a little more rice.</li><li>Very little amount of rice and chicken, bottom of the container soaking in oil after we finished.</li><li>It had chicken, rice, two types of potatoes, salad, tzatziki, and pita.</li><li>The rice was n't any different than what you 'd get at `` real'' Greek restaurants.</li><li>I wish they 'd left it on the skewers, it 's more fun to eat it that way, but it was skewer-less and thrown on top of the rice.</li><li>I came here for dinner because I saw the awesome reviews, but after ordering their oyako-don, I was pretty disappointed- the flavour was subpar and the rice itself was non-traditional.</li><li>I order their veggie bento box, which comes with tempera, rice, salad, soup, a roll and a side dish ( different ones, depends on the day).</li><li>The portions were more than generous, and the rolls had a great rice to filling ratio.</li><li>Im used to those AYCE places where they stuff a mere slice into the handroll which is difficult to finish since 90% of it is rice.</li><li>They put a sweet sauce on the rice too kinda like the sauce on the eel).</li><li>The food was great, I was full afterwards and I did n't feel like there was too much rice which seems to be a common issue with most sushi places.</li><li>The quality has gone down because their dishes are more watered down now and they giving miserly portions of vegetables/chicken with lots and lots of rice.</li><li>So when we 're around town we stop by for takeout before heading home to grab their chicken shawarma with rice.</li><li>And their rice has a hint of flavour.</li><li>It is served on an oval platter and includes half rice, half meat, a few potato wedges, onions, pickled peppers, white sauce and hot sauce.</li><li>The garlic potatoes are fantastic and you ca n't fault the chicken nor the rice.</li><li>One of my favorite sides is the potatoes and the hummus. really a hole in the wall! love their potato and rice besides the main dish.</li><li>I decided to give this place a try one evening and ordered a full portion lamb shish kebab, which came with rice, potatoes and salad, and I was floored by how amazing it was!</li><li>They have pickled onions and a few jalapeno on the rice, which definitely adds to the whole date. there are two sizes, small, which comes with one skewer ( ~ 9.99 or so), and reg that comes with two ( 13.99).</li><li>I asked him to tell me how to make the rice but he said he 'd have to kill me.</li><li>My only one unpleasant experience is when a lady served us the shawarma plate and she forgot to top the rice with some onions and garlic sauce, ( place was not busy, only one person dining in and one takeout customer) so I had to walk back from the car in the rain to kindly request for the toppings that add a gazillion notch to this dish, which she gladly did.</li><li>The rice is out of this world !!!</li><li>The salad is fresh and the rice is yummy!</li><li>But you definitely should go here for the Sh awarma plate because it is so delicious and huge! popped in here during lunch, and of course it 's because I was craving my New York style chicken on the rocks. the portion was huge but it was n't satisfying. the rice was over cooked but the chicken was good- I was looking for that perfect garlic sauce but it was n't enough in the meal.</li><li>It is similar to their rice but waaaaaaaaaaaaay better!</li><li>The rice was nice and fluffy.</li><li>Also got a biyrani rice which was delicious the rice had great texture and it was a large portion.</li><li>Their rice is deliciously fluffy too.</li><li>Te rice was delicious and the tomato was well grilled.</li><li>I just do n't understand how the patrons are not all fat after all the bread, butter, rice, kabob, baklava and so forth The food is OK and the price is good.</li><li>We ate Soltani kabob with half rice and salad.</li><li>The rice was light and fluffy, but lacked flavour ( which might just be stye).</li><li>And the rice is airy and slightly buttered.</li><li>They came with a huge pile of delicious rice.</li><li>The order is a decent size for the price and the rice is very well spiced as well.</li><li>The salad, potatoes, and rice were average, but the meat was very unappetizing.</li><li>Chicken is tender and juicy well mix with the rice and egg.</li><li>Everything tasted average, The rolls are big, very little rice, almost too much ingredients inside and I 'm not sure all the flavours worked together.</li><li>Had: Shrimp tempura lunch set ( $ 8.95)- Comes with 3 pieces of shrimp tempura, 4 pieces of veggie, rice, soup, salad, and three veggie sides ( today 's were sesame oil broccoli, black peppered bean sprouts, and shredded potato with mayo.</li><li>The rice is fresh and moist with the correct flavouring combination of sugar and wine.</li><li>Besides the usual sashimi slices of salmon, tuna, and tai, there were also warm saucy unagi slices and mini nigiri of spicy tuna mixed with crunchy tempura bits all laid out scrumptiously on a bed of sweet and vinegary warm rice.</li><li>We got ox tail and jerk chicken and found many slithers of styrofoam in the rice.</li><li>Make sure you get gravy on the rice or the rice will taste a little bland in comparison to the chicken.</li><li>Also: peas and rice is extremely fluffy and gorgeous, melt in your mouth.</li><li>Chicken that is tasteless and chewy and `` cartilage'', mushy salty rice and Kebbeh that is drenched in oil that when you pick it up oil just drips from it is NOT appetizing.</li><li>And that 's exactly what I got, the meat and the rice!</li><li>The rice was quite bland and the salad wilted.</li><li>You also get rice and soup for free if you go that route.</li><li>The salsa was n't well seasoned, the refried beans has no favor, nor the rice.</li><li>The meat they give you is barely anything and the rice is dry and tastes old.</li><li>The food here is great too, I especially like how their sushi, rolls and hand rolls are not stuffed with excessive rice like most AYCE places!</li><li>Bento boxes, fried rice, ramen/udon, and rolls ... like over 168 items or something.</li><li>My dislikes- all sushi rolls, the rice was too sticky sometmes gooey, too much vinegar, the rolls with crunchy bits had tons uncooked PANKO which tasted nasty- youre suppose to cook your tempura bits and if you use PANKO please fry it with butter first, panko straight from the box is just bread crumbs.</li><li>Fish was top notch and rice properly flavoured.</li><li>They were polite and made it a good birthday celebration for me Able to.maintain the food quality, very attended staff, friendly, service in good standard, sashimi is always fresh, sushi rolls has the right portion of rice, weekends they serve scallop sashimi, spicy tuna hand roll, variety of good quality sashimi choices. reasonable priced and dessert is average.</li><li>THey were n't huge or overstuffed with rice, which made it mad easy to eat.</li><li>It 's so nice to have just sashimi instead of sushi ( with rice).</li><li>The rice for the sushi was mushy, and the white tuna sashimi was not so white.</li><li>Nigiri had too much rice while fish was proportionally very small.</li><li>When a sushi connoisseur says that it 's all in the rice, then please believe it !!</li><li>The rice lacked flavour and I had to rely heavily on the soy sauce.</li><li>Beef tataki sashimi, herb tuna sashimi or something like that, maguro hand roll .. actually hand roll because there 's too much rice, scallop sashimi- ordered ONE and it came out as a small plate unlike how the rest of the sashimi is served.</li><li>Loved the Eel Fried Rice even though there 's not much eel meat in the rice.</li><li>Maki were AAAMAZING- so little rice and they themselves were so small, very happy about that cuz I could try a bunch of different ones:) I recommend ordering the 4 piece special rolls under the dinner menu, they 're all fancy and pretty and I guarantee you will not be disappointed!</li><li>Even though the dish was found under the soup category, it is saucy enough to have with rice.</li><li>The beef in my dish was tender, garnished with a lot of onions and some brocoli and a large serving of rice.</li><li>I also love ordering their rice and beef ribs dish, and crispy chicken with rice.</li><li>You have a choice of fries or rice.</li><li>Their rice was relatively dry, but the pork chop was well-seasoned.</li><li>The rice was not warm, and the veggies were hard, not cooked but flashed to heat.</li><li>Dragon roll is very dissapointing, 9 $ for tiny roll only consisting of rice, tempura shrimp, green onion, nori, fish roe.</li><li>This evening my husband ordered the Salmon Teriyaki bento box which came with 6 California rolls, yaki mandu as well as your typical soup, salad and rice.</li><li>I had some of Grandpa 's rolls, and the rice was a tad too soft).</li><li>It comes with well the spicy chicken, rice, green beans ( best beans I 've ever eaten) and tofu.</li><li>Souvlaki, pita, salad, rice and the yummiest potatoes !!!!</li><li>The chicken was absolutely delicious, nice and spicy and the rice and peas were great with the gravy.</li><li>Some of the staples are the congee, the noodles and rice and usually a side order.</li><li>We had the deep fried tentacles, some kind of rice with mushrooms, chicken and bok choi ( one of those green things that people steam ?) and it came in a hot bowl so that the rice at the botton was sticky and crunchy at the same time: D Also had the vermicelli that 's part of the special, congee with surf clam, choy sum with oyster sauce, hot and sour soup, my friend has the cheung fun and rice roll with duck in it, and rice cake with cabbage and some pork.</li><li>If I say it 's not spicy ... it 's really not spicy* I did n't like the mozarella cheese, it had weird texture and it took away the spiciness of the dish* Instant noodles were good after it soaked up all the sauce* When you are 80% done, ask for your rice to be cooked and they will do it for you* I love the crispy bottom part of the rice Summary: I would go back to Joons, but would order things differently.</li><li>If I say it 's not spicy ... it 's really not spicy* I did n't like the mozarella cheese, it had weird texture and it took away the spiciness of the dish* Instant

back to Joons, but would order things differently.</li><li>Mediocre food, portions were smaller than usually, u have to add cheese, ramen and rice cake, do n't bother getting the rice add ones We waited 30mins for our food to come and they would n't give us our side dishes until our meal came ......</li><li>The rice ( com tam) is hard and dry.</li><li>The rice was flavorful and had tons of large juicy shrimp and tender chicken.</li><li>The Shrimp with lobster sauce was very dark ( looked liked they seasoned it with soy sauce), not authentic but tasty with lots of sauce to pour over the rice.</li><li>I ordered the red curry lunch special for only $ 6.95- it comes with a salad and rice.</li><li>The chicken skewers were like shoe leather, the rice was overly salted and Falafel was god awful ( cold and hard).</li><li>I asked the man if there was a special and he told me that the special of the day was the chicken shawarma plate for 7.49 and that it came with chicken, rice, salad and potatoes.</li><li>On the rolls we ordered, the rice was undercooked and the avocado in the rolls ranged from barely ripened to completely raw and crunchy-chewy.</li><li>Chewy, this happened to be the word that came to mind the most while eating, be it the chewy rice the chewy avocado, the chewy mayo crab or even the chewy eel.</li><li>It came with a miso soup, edamame, and the bento box ( rice, salad, chicken, tofu, japchae). everything was average; the sauce on the chicken teriyaki was overpowering.</li><li>Their sushi pizza is good as well ( excellent presentation wise), but could be improved if the rice was a little more fried and if it had green onion, caviar, and tobiko on it.</li><li>The sticky rice was a little too sticky for me as I had to use a knife to literally cut through it ( my plastic fork broke trying to unstick the rice enough so that I did n't put the entire bowl of rice in my mouth at once).</li><li>You have to order your rice seperate as well as the naan bread seperate.</li><li>The rice comes on a plate, not in a bowl, on a plate and the small was enough for sharing between 3 people.</li><li>Does n't matter if it 's with naan or with rice, I will eat that stuff up QUICK.</li><li>Usually about 3-4 Vegetarian options in the buffet ( that is besides the deserts, rice, naan and all the other stuff that goes along with most indian food.)</li><li>The rice on which it is served would be great too, if it were just a bit warmer.</li><li>I got too many vegetables and not enough rice.</li><li>We got fish &amp; tofu, chicken and broccoli, and rice.</li><li>Served with a charred tomato over rice ( either dill rice or plain rice).</li><li>But later because the food is to salty we order 1 more rice, then she laughed a bit and said `` I told you it is not enough''.</li><li>Of course, it comes with rice.</li><li>Was n't a big fan of the jerk chicken ( actually it was pretty bad) and ended up throwing out the rice and peas ( was n't my cup of tea) but the roti was delicious.</li><li>They do not make traditional caribbean food and served the oxtail and rice and beans with cucumber instead of cabbage.</li><li>The rice was so sour, it was like sucking on a lemon.</li><li>Soon after, the good food flood gates flung open and we were served the beef pannang, fried duck, rice, and noodles.</li><li>The fried rice lacked the forceful flavours of the other dishes, and the rice itself was a bit dry.</li><li>The duck red curry serviced with rice ( $ 21) is such an incredible dish.</li><li>The rice was even worse.</li><li>Honestly, I liked the plain rice they gave me better than the fried rice in the coconut.</li><li>I tried the Penang chicken curry- a red curry spicy sauce topped with grilled chicken, it came with rice.</li><li>I thought the rice could be a bit sweeter, but it was balanced out by the mango- not bad! 2) Mango Roll with Ice Cream: DEELISHUS.</li><li>The rice was hard and the mango was n't fresh.</li><li>Panang curry with crispy beef- while the curry was creamy and went well with the rice, the beef was lacking any texture and again the breading was too thick.</li><li>Okay, it 's not Peking Duck quality, and the birds are not serialized from birth to keep track of quality, and there are certainly no time wasted on decorum, but for a local BBQ place where one can purchase a duck, half a duck, chicken, BBQ pork, duck liver, sausages, tofu, and a simple rice takeaway, there are no competition within a 3km radius.</li><li>Ended up just eating rice and peas with gravy.</li><li>You get coleslaw, rice and peas accompanying your meat selection.</li><li>I love the rice and peas that sit underneath the pork, and its topped with some cabbage and carrot slaw.</li><li>The Jerk Chicken lunch special comes with rice and beans, coleslaw and gravy.</li><li>The menu offers up jerk chicken and jerk pork with some additional items like goat, patties, and rice.</li><li>They always put a generous amount of sauce on your rice and beans.</li><li>Overall the rice, noodle, dumpling, and bread-like dishes are very much Chinese style, but it does differ a little from mainstream Chinese cooking just to have its own unique taste.</li><li>Skewers ( most of the things on their BBQ menu)- Really flavourful and goes great with rice!</li><li>Although the usual noodles, rice costs as much as other ball places, the meat dishes are a pretty penny.</li><li>The chicken teriyaki came only with A LOT of been sprouts no other vegetables as it claims to come with along with miso soup which was just ok and even the rice wasnt great.</li><li>The menu consists of shawarmas ( Lamb, chicken, beef), falafel, kebabs ( beef or chicken) in a pita or as a platter with salad, hummus, garlic sauce and rice or fries for the meat options.</li><li>The rice was great ( kudos for the lack of frozen peas and carrots).</li><li>The rice and peas are excellent as well as the curries and roti.</li><li>The salad is tasty, the rice is great, and the portion is plenty filling.</li><li>It 's not the traditional `` thick'' tahina you may get some places ( it 's more of a watered-down liquid, in a squeeze bottle) but it 's still very tasty and in unlimited supply -- a group of 6 of us go through SEVERAL bottles of it when we 're there, putting it on everything -- the appetizers, the meat, the rice, everything.</li><li>The rice and and salad that came with it were excellent as well.</li><li>Even something as simple as the rice was full of flavour.</li><li>If in your plate, the beef, the rice and the salad is not good then I really do n't know what to rate this place as.</li><li>All the meats, lamb, beef, chicken are very flavourful and tender.The rice and salad are very good as well.</li><li>It came with salad and rice.</li><li>Their rice is just plain white rice, which they ask if you want soy sauce on and their garlic bread is just really mediocre.</li><li>4./ You can keep your prices the same if you have a vegetable, salad, and potato or rice with the entree.</li><li>Salad, side rice, potato are all very bland.</li><li>I ordered the rack of lamb with salad and baked potato, my girlfriend ordered the 1lb broiled lobster with rice and baked potato.</li><li>Good but extremely forgettable The rice was a joke.</li><li>The curry was incredibly delicious with the rice.</li><li>The rice is nicely cooked and it does the job.</li><li>Good serving of rice and a very generous portion of oxtail stew.</li><li>The rice had a nice spice profile to bring out the flavor.</li><li>The rice was cooked with too much water so it was very water logged and was n't able to absorb the curry very well.</li><li>We usually always get a rice and one of my favorites there is the salted fish and chicken fried rice that I can never get enough of.</li><li>The dishes are really standard vegetable, rice, noodles, and congee with a different spin so avoid ordering two similar dishes or you may find them tasting similar.</li><li>Try the fish and rice.</li><li>I ordered the Crispy Chicken combo with rice, tofu, and some veggies.</li><li>The one potato was under cooked, hard as F and the rice was dry.</li><li>That, and the rice was extremely greasy.</li><li>With side dishes and rice rounding out the meal, we were very satisfied; the portions were generous but not overly so.</li><li>You have to pay $ 2.00 extra for each topping you want added ( ie. rice cake, mozzarella cheese, rice, noodles).</li><li>The Manager said wait 20mins and the rice will be ready ... I am not sitting here waiting for rice to cook, I can do that at home .... if you run out of something then give me something else ... I asked for noodles or potatoes and they said no .... like WTF!</li><li>My coworker had some kind of dish served in a round kettle where everything was separated: rice, meat, vegetables, etc but then you are supposed to mix it all together.</li><li>We added noodles, cheese and rice cakes and it was yummy:) The spice is perfect, enough to clear your sinuses, but not sweat profusely from the heat: p The downside I can think of is that service is a bit slow and the add ons ( rice cakes, noodles, cheese, rice etc) are extra.</li><li>The portion got even smaller and 3 portions with noodles, rice cakes, and rice were barely filling.</li><li>You 'll probably need to top it off with some extras like rice cake, ramen, or rice.</li><li>My only disappointment was that they would n't mix the rice in with the chicken, the way it 's supposed to be!</li><li>If you get rice with the dish, do n't eat everything right away.</li><li>Hearty comfort food for me! n the mash potato side dish is so yummy too! towards the end when u only have a bit of chicken n pieces of veggies left in ur pan, you can ask them to make fried rice with it. they will bring over rice, hot sauce/sesame oil mixture n mix it all up for u. the owner lady even formed the rice into a heart shape for me n my boyfriend one time. it was too cute ~! the Dak Gal Bee is so good there, every time we go that 's all we get. so i do n't know how the other items on the menu taste. oh and the minimum order for Dak Gal Bee is 2 people portions. service is fine, waitresses are pleasant, but sometimes do n't speak much English, but who cares, food 's good!</li><li>I mean, it coated what was in the pan, but unless they added more sauce ( which they probably did), there would not be enough for the rice.</li><li>The rice was NOT worth it.</li><li>The JS1 is just normal dak gal bee with chicken and vegetable where you can add on the rice cakes, cheese, noodles, sweet potato, vegetable, steamed rice and fried rice for $ 1- $ 2 each.</li><li>Now that they got their customers LOCKED, they jacked up prices by a bit also the rice and salmon has changed to a lower quality, also the owner is very rude never says anything just walks around and bumps people on shoulders with no apologies.</li><li>The seasoning of the rice is perfect and it still has a bit of warmth ( not warm warm but not cold and brittle) to contrast the cold fish.</li><li>I find there was an even amount of rice and filling inside.</li><li>Too much vinegar in the rice but the price is very competitive.</li><li>Both rolls had a good ratio of rice to ingredients- which is a bonus for me because I hate when restaurants add so much rice and you can barely taste what is inside the roll!</li><li>With a lot of stuffing and very little rice, lots of carrots and avocado.</li><li>Unlike some other reviewers unlucky experience, my rolls were NOT stuffed with rice.</li><li>It was actually so little rice in the dynamite and the spider rolls that i had to figure out a way to pick them up without the stuffing falling out.</li><li>And the rice was a little weird ... a little on the grocery-store-sushi side, kinda of sweet and a little harder than i would like.</li><li>Their rice is amazing, fish fresh, their fish: rice is as it should be and their service is so abrupt and rude that is it somewhat amusing and makes for good lunch time conversation if you are stuck for discussion topics with your companion.</li><li>Their rice is amazing, fish fresh, their fish: rice is as it should be and their service is so abrupt and rude that is it somewhat amusing and makes for good lunch time conversation if you are stuck for discussion topics with your companion.</li><li>Taste, lots of rice.</li><li>The rice proportion is perfect.</li><li>I mean at least the rice was hot and nice.</li><li>After the dumplings were served, they brought out plates of veggies ( green beans and spinach), then the rice and noodle dishes.</li><li>We also ordered the lobster, house special fried rice and broccoli.</li><li>Dumplings are great too and so are all the various rice and noodle dishes.</li><li>I still like their food, till last Friday, the rice I got looks like left over rice from the morning.</li><li>It 's a meal for two with lots of meat, lettuce, soon tofu soup, and rice.</li><li>Pork Belly BBQ ~ That 's the only type of BBQ that you can enjoy indoor year round in Canada, this is cook at the table. ~ It usually comes with lettuce, bean sauce, raw garlic slices and rice which you could make your own lettuce wrap with. ~ You 'll hear a lot of people going ewww when they hear raw garlic slices but trust me, it taste perfect with the meat and sauce here.</li><li>Soon Tofu ( Spicy Tofu Soup) ~ No one ate this somehow which is great since I love it. ~ This is usually eaten with rice, which is great for a quick meal and lot how hot it is which is great for those cold winter days ~ I also always have the craving for an extra spicy one when I have a hangover.</li><li>Verdict: ~ Everything is as good as always, there 's a reason I have been coming back for years. ~ My faves are the Pork Belly BBQ, the Kang Poon Kee ( Spicy Fried Chicken) &amp; Jook Sam Kyup Sal, especially with the added rice at the end. ~ Ca n't wait to come back for patio season.</li><li>I asked for the soup and rice to be taken to go, and that my mackerel be served to me at the restaurant ( my brother was eating his entire meal there).</li><li>For a bit over 8 dollars, I had yummy pork cutlet, filling rice and salad, and so many banchans I could n't even finish.</li><li>The raita that came with it was very watered down, too much so, so the point that it was like pouring water on the rice.</li><li>Third star is knocked off for the fact that my rice tasted like nothing ( not even like rice, more like paper), there were 3 pieces of chickens in my whole order and my salad was actually just chopped up onions.</li><li>I had the ground chicken kebob combo which comes with rice, salad, naan, and some sauce.</li><li>We ordered some rice and some chicken balls, The rice was fine, but the chicken balls were a bit dry.</li><li>Not a huge fan of the spice they use but it did need a touch more salt along with the rice.</li><li>The chicken is n't the only star in the meal, the rice and coleslaw provides the same amount of attention.</li><li>One of the stars of the show here is the peas and rice- or, rice and peas ... luscious ... melt in your mouth.</li><li>The pho here is average but not fantastic and the rice ( chicken, pork chop, and egg) my boyfriend ordered was decent but his rice was sogging into congee.</li><li>The pho here is average but not fantastic and the rice ( chicken, pork chop, and egg) my boyfriend ordered was decent but his rice was sogging into congee.</li><li>If they are going to serve good food they might as well start with good brand for their rice.</li><li>Asian love rice and I say their rice is like the cheapest one on the market.</li><li>We did n't eat the rice because of the pleasant smell.</li><li>They serve you a side of beef broth soup with your rice order!</li><li>- Chicken fried rice turned into fried rice with chicken on top COOL BUT the rice was very moist in oil.</li><li>We were even hesitant to ask for a small plate so that the rice could be shared.</li><li>They had a very small selection but the pluses were:- very little rice in the maki- yum- dynamite rolls sooo fweeesh- coconut shrimp GET IN MY BELLY- deep fried squid, you sexy beast.- spicy salmon maki with sauce SQUISHED in between two salmons INSIDE the maki. !?!?!?- pop included in price- fast service, nice service would defo come back!</li><li>Also, the rice has a slight tartness from the sushi vinegar, which is very reassuring because normally a lot places just plop rice in a bowl and serve sashimi on top of it.</li><li>Also, the rice has a slight tartness from the sushi vinegar, which is very reassuring because normally a lot places just plop rice in a bowl and serve sashimi on top of it.</li><li>Miso soup was good, rice was hot.</li><li>The perfect mix of rice and soup.</li><li>I ordered the spicy chicken teriyaki lunch box ( lunch boxes are available from 11am-3pm) which came with meso soup, few maki rolls, rice, salad, and few pieces of fruits ( check the photo below) teriyaki chicken tasted A-OK.</li><li>The rice was a good portion, but the only sashimi that seemed fresh and not defrosted was the salmon.</li><li>The rice is very vinegary and went well with the salmon.</li><li>The fish was fresh, but by no means generous, and the rice could have been better.</li><li>The rice was too soft and the sushi not fresh.</li><li>Rice looks like at least 2 days old rice and so on ...</li><li>It was appetizing and savoury, the sushi was fresh, the rice were cooked well.</li><li>On the other hand, the rice was cold and hard from the california rolls and the sushi.</li><li>It was no doubt old rice, probably leftover rice from last night, seeing as they opened half an hour late.</li><li>Food is okay, rice is dry, sushi is subpar.</li><li>A friend took me here for dinner and we got the sushi boat D. The sushi was good, fresh and had just the right amount of rice.</li><li>Good quality rice.</li><li>The rice is too dry and does n't have much flavour.</li><li>The sushi here has always been somewhat sub-par with the rice being hard and they even cut down on the amount of sushi they give you per bento box!</li><li>The rice was quite chewy and tasted old.</li><li>It comes with beef ribs, rice, spicy salmon roll, miso soup, and green salad.</li><li>Fish was not fresh and rice was mushy.</li><li>No where else have I had the best combination of rice and chicken together.</li><li>Shrimp and rice was delicious and fresh crunchy fresh veggies chicken balls were full of white meat and crunchy outside great service and great chinese food for a low price If there is a rating below one star, I would use that.</li><li>It was a nice dish when some of the spicy sauce was mixed in; the pot crisped the rice nicely, and the veggies were fresh.</li><li>After they carve out the rice, they pour water into the bowl to create a congee-like soup for you to drink/eat afterwards.</li><li>A dish comes with rice and water is added to the bowl the rice is originally served is making a congee-esque dish ( not sure what it 's called but it 's tasty!).</li><li>Lots of veggies and their rice is speckled with some black rice so it turns it a purplish color^^ My friends who have ordered their other soup dishes all like their meal so this place gets a big thumbs up from me.</li><li>I 've never had my dish served on a wooden board before and rarely do I get purple rice.</li><li>I give them 5 stars because the server was very attentive, and took the time to explain to us how to eat the nurungji- that 's the scorched rice in the stone pot, after they have scooped out the rice for you.</li><li>I give them 5 stars because the server was very attentive, and took the time to explain to us how to eat the nurungji- that 's the scorched rice in the stone pot, after they have scooped out the rice for you.</li><li>The server will scoop the rice from a clay pot into a bowl, then fill the bowl with water, forming some sort of rice snack that people enjoy eating later.</li><li>The server will scoop the rice from a clay pot into a bowl, then fill the bowl with water, forming some sort of rice snack that people enjoy eating later.</li><li>By the way, if you ever wonder why the waiter pour water in the rice stone after transferring the rice in the bowl, here 's the reason: like most non-korean people, we would think that they pour the water to easily clean the stone, but in fact, you should be eating it.</li><li>By the way, if you ever wonder why the waiter pour water in the rice stone after transferring the rice in the bowl, here 's the reason: like most non-korean people, we would think that they pour the water to easily clean the stone, but in fact, you should be eating it.</li><li>Flavorful soup, silky tofu, seafood, perfectly cooked rice, freshly cracked eggs half cooked in the soup, plus the water soaking the flavor of burned rice bottom on the stone bowl, it 's a perfect combination of flavors and texture.</li><li>Flavorful soup, silky tofu, seafood, perfectly cooked rice, freshly cracked eggs half cooked in the soup, plus the water soaking the flavor of burned rice bottom on the stone bowl, it 's a perfect combination of flavors and texture.</li><li>Unique thing that sets it apart is the multii-grain purple rice rather than the traditional white rice.</li><li>They make a great bulgogi and I love the rice.</li><li>Great tofu, soup was a bit on the salty side but the rice helped with that.</li><li>When they bring out the rice, it comes in its own hot pot.</li><li>If you end up needing more rice, you can always eat the rice remains from there.</li><li>The waitstaff will be using it to pour into the emptied hot stone rice bowls to loosen those bottom-crisped pieces of rice.</li><li>The choice of appetizers are really tasty and the rice is delicious too, especially when dipped in the soup broth.</li><li>- Rice !! love the rice here !!</li><li>Soup, tofu, raw egg ( it cooks in the hot broth), kimchi, meat, rice and a few side dishes.</li><li>Love the stone bowl and stirring like a mad man to work that egg into the rice.</li><li>The rice was a nice complement to enjoy with the soup.</li><li>I love putting the egg in and watching it cook in the hot pot and I just scoop the rice right in and enjoy.</li><li>The rice that comes with the meal is purple and I love the authenticity of the overall meal.</li><li>The soup had lots of flavour and goes really well with the rice.</li><li>The pot was sizzling when the waiter brought it and the rice was purple.</li><li>A ton of rice to be honest ... I felt like I could have fed at least 12 kids with it.</li><li>I personally would prefer the hot water not poured on the stone pot but the crispy rice kept till the end to mix with the remaining stew ( if any lol).</li><li>The rice is later scraped out by one of the ( good looking Korean male!) waiters so that you can later pour your extra soup into this bowl to flavour the rice still stuck on the side of stone bowl.</li><li>The rice was cooked in a korean stone pot which made the flavor exceptional.</li><li>I did n't know I was supposed to crack one of those eggs into the bowl of soup, so I sat there, waiting for the rice.</li><li>What surprised me was the hot stone pot they used to serve the rice.</li><li>This left us with crispy rice at the end!</li><li>The rice was also cold, and questionably pale for so called purple rice.</li><li>Hint* We always tell them to not pour the water in our empty rice bowls so that the leftover rice crisps on the sides of the bowl and we can scrape it off and eat the crispy rice in our soup- delicious!</li><li>BUT, they make one of the best rice I have ever had, i almost always ask for extra rice and i do n't know if the hot stone pot is the magic to it all, but the rice seems to compliment everything dish perfectly.</li><li>BUT, they make one of the best rice I have ever had, i almost always ask for extra rice and i do n't know if the

good, their side dishes are getting worse and worse.</li><li>After all is said and done, you can have the burnt rice in hot water- congee' ish.</li><li>Tofu is gorgeously soft, they serve the rice ( purple rice) and pour the water into the stone pots for the soup for you too!</li><li>The crispy rice at the bottom gives it a crunchy texture, and the semi raw egg on top tastes great when mixed in with the rice.</li><li>The crispy rice at the bottom gives it a crunchy texture, and the semi raw egg on top tastes great when mixed in with the rice.</li><li>The bibimbap comes with gochujang ( otherwise you have to pay 50 cents extra for it), and it 's the really thick kind that you have to smear onto your rice, rather that squeeze from a bottle.</li><li>I like that they do give the water + hardened rice at the end if the meal.</li><li>Food was way too salty, and I thought the purple rice hot stone bowl was a huge source of waste ( so much of the rice was stuck in the stone pot!)</li><li>I 'm not a fan of the water rice ( dessert) so this time I asked if they do n't put the water, and letting the rice sitting there during our meal, it became crispy and yummy.</li><li>They get the stone hot enough so that the rice at the bottom really crisps up nicely.</li><li>In any case, their soon tofu is presented the same way as BCD in LA with the rice served in a dol sot and then the dol sot with the leftover rice is filled with hot water to make a porridge.</li><li>Even before our sushi and maki rolls made it to our table, the maki rolls were coming apart, rice was falling off of the sushi when I picked it up by hand!</li><li>And I want to emphasize, I eat sushi with my hands because it gives me more control and holds sushi together better, but the sushi was so poorly put together, the rice was not properly made, that it fell apart as I brought to my mouth ...</li><li>Food ( Lunch): Besides the cooking table I have been for lunch service and ate the chicken-bento-box with soup, small salad, 4 sushi rolls, rice and tofu.</li><li>Teppanyaki Ume ( see picture) is a very good full lunch which includes soup, salad, shrimp appetizer, rice, veggies, chicken and steak.</li><li>The meat is plain and the rice overcooked, and there 's little in the way of interesting herbs, sauces, or salsa to liven it up.</li><li>The standard burrito build is rice, your choice of re-fried or black beans, grilled veggies ( mixed peppers and onions mostly), mild or medium sauce, both tomato and corn salsas, cheese, lettuce and sour cream.</li><li>The pork was juicy and the rice had a good flavor.</li><li>But I 'm not 100% if it 's from the shawarma or the rice itself is oily to begin with.</li><li>So for the really healthy people, keep that in mind when ordering the shawarma or anything that comes with the rice.</li><li>As you work your way through the chicken and salad, the rice ends up being coated in a mixer spicy BBQ sauce, garlic sauce and which ever salad dressing you chose ( ranch for me!) leaving a sloppy mess of yumminess at the end.</li><li>Alongside the soup they provide a small dishes of rice and three different types of kimchi that accompany the meal, all of which were really tasty.</li><li>For a group of 4, we got the family size Gamjatang ( pork bone soup, comes with 2 rice) for $ 23; 99, japchae ( glass noodles with veggies) $ 8.99 and beef kalbi ( small, $ 15.99, comes with 1 rice).</li><li>The potato chunks make the broth thicker which I enjoyed near the end with my rice.</li><li>Everything from their drinks to their rice and noodle dishes are amazing.</li><li>The house dessert on the other hand was disappointing, red bean soup worth purple rice and tapioca.</li><li>Fried rice is always the Yang Zhou Fried Rice.</li><li>Big hunks of extremely flavourful chicken, tasty rice, a pita and tzatziki sauce.</li><li>I went during lunch ( 12-1 pm) and was craving bibimbap and thought you could do no wrong with a new place ordering a simple rice and toppings dish.</li><li>My favorite is by far the pork bone soup, it spicy and goes really well with the rice that they give you and the side dishes of bean sprouts, fish curd, kimchi, and seaweed.</li><li>I 've often brought friends and suggested they order some meat katsu, bulgogi, kan poong ki ( sweet &amp; spicy chicken) or bi bim bap ( veggies, rice, beef, fried egg, &amp; spicy sauce).</li><li>The side dishes came but they also brought out our rice at the same time.</li><li>Bimimbap is vegetables/meat on top of rice and you basically mix the ingredients together before eating.</li><li>The chicken is perfectly grilled with lots of sauce and is accompanied by delicious roasted potatoes, salad ( I ca n't get enough of this dressing!), their amazing glass noodles, rice and miso soup.</li><li>The food is tasteless and the plate of food I had for takeout was 90% rice and not good.</li><li>`` Can I have a larger salad instead of the rice ?'' ... `` NO''.</li><li>If my memory serves me, they usually put butter on the rice at the other locations, but did n't do so here.</li><li>The rice however was a bit of a mess as it smelled off.</li><li>The kebabs were sumptuously savoury and the rice was delicious!</li><li>They were all good and went well with the rice.</li><li>The meat was tender and juicy, the rice was great too.</li><li>I ordered lamb shank with dill rice and it was a very large portion -- meat was very tender and the rice was good, not too oily at all which I find is the problem with some other places I otherwise like.</li><li>The meat seemed high quality and the rice was well cooked.</li><li>The rice was cooked perfectly and the consistency of the risotto was spot on.</li><li>Over all the the portion of the rice is too much and the quality of the salmon is OK but it is very thin.You do n't feel the Salmon or even Avocado.It just does n't satisfy your taste buds.</li><li>The rice to fish balance for their rolls its quite good for an AYCE place.</li><li>Sashimi on the top of the rolls were fresh but the roll itself has too much rice which fills you up really fast.</li><li>You can tell they wanted to fill us up on rice.</li><li>The Rolls were huge, but only because there was so much rice stuffed into it! 3.</li><li>The Dynamite and Spider rolls were great, not too much rice.</li><li>Sushi had way too much rice.</li><li>Seafood is hit and miss. I think the rice has nice flavor however the parisienne potatoes are always overcooked.</li><li>The Persian potatoes were ok nothing to really write home about and since the rice was already there i decided to taste it and I was pleasantly surprised it had a really nice flavour.</li><li>The lunch is amazing-delicious, fresh chicken with some parisienne potatoes and veggies, or rice.</li><li>Both of us ordered calamari one lunch one dinner size ( order the small there is not that much a difference for the cash), had sides of bland rice and undercooked veg that that knife could not even cut through.</li><li>Lunch special includes all you can eat hot and sour soup, varieties of cooked chicken, rice, noodles, and much more.</li><li>The rice was plain steamed rice ...</li><li>They make it in front of you, with the rice, wasabi, nori, eel ( which he torch seared the top first0, egg, and some rice balls, mixed it up all together, and it served at like 7-8 bowls full.</li><li>Ordered from the date night menu ... not very impressed .. the chicken was very dry had a gross olive paste smothered on it .. the rice was littered with salt and the plate was soaked in soya sauce ..</li><li>The rice, cold noodles, and salad were serviceable but forgettable.</li><li>The taste was decent, and the rice was good.</li><li>Actually the rice was better than the fish at times too, which is both a good and bad thing.</li><li>My vegetarian box had pretty much the same thing with the plain rice, steamed veggies, vegetable tempura, 3 mini pieces of cucumber roll and deep fried tofu ( forgot the actual name of whats its called) Dessert, since the box came with free ice cream, our choices were vanilla, mint chocolate and mango.</li><li>We found a tissue paper in the rice.</li><li>A LOT more rice than fish Are you kidding me.</li><li>Some memorable dishes for me:- the blanched SPINACH SALAD starter- super palate cleansing- SASHIMI NIGIRI- did n't check/could n't figure out what fish these were, but so buttery fresh. rice was very appropriately sized to the fish portion- SASHIMI LETTUCE ROLLS- seeing shredded lettuce wrapped within my sashimi felt weird to me, but it did help pick up some extra of the ponzu-type dressing so that it was adequately saucy- BAKED OYSTER- diced and baked with a cream sauce, topped with cheese and baked in the giant shell.</li><li>I love their `` Kyoto'' deal which comes with maki ( 3 california rolls, 3 cucumber rolls), chicken teriyaki, salad, rice, miso soup, 2 spring rolls, steamed vegetables, and desert.</li><li>It 's okay to use overnight leftover rice for fried rice but this was out longer.</li><li>You take a bowl and load it up with protein, veggies, rice or noodles, and a ladle of sauce, and then you give it to the chef who stir-fries it on a huge flat teppan-table thing.</li><li>The rice and noodle selection is impressive.</li><li>There is 2 main buffet tables with stuff like rice, veggies, meats- your regular chinese buffet items.</li><li>The congee tasted like they used a blender to blend the rice; or they had frozen the rice and then boiled it to save energy.</li><li>The congee tasted like they used a blender to blend the rice; or they had frozen the rice and then boiled it to save energy.</li><li>I do n't mean to be a snob or anything but I do get a hearty chuckle when I see a group of people order rice or noodle dishes just for themselves partially because the plate looks ginormous in front of them and partially because I cannot fathom how they can finish it: P.</li><li>Who knew rice and water could be so tasty ?!</li><li>The noodles and rice are made well and full of flavour.</li><li>- Favorite noodle: beef &amp; black bean, or shrimp in scrambled egg sauce- Favorite rice: smoked salmon, or yin-yang rice- Favorite side dish: snow pea greens &amp; oyster mushrooms, spicy fried garoupa, wonton in soup, shrimp &amp; chive rice noodle rolls Portions are bigger in the restaurant than if you order takeout, but huge either way:) You ca n't get better food for such a good price!</li><li>The `` ho nam'' chicken in hot pot, 25 mins wait and the rice was mushy.</li><li>The rice is good, with their different curries ( they have both veggie and meaty curries), and their pakoras are pretty good as well.</li><li>Chris: Butter Chicken with some kind of rice.</li><li>I ordered the butter chicken, rice and naan bread- AMAZING!</li><li>The rice and nan were also amazing.</li><li>The rice had cilantro and other herbs in it which I did n't like.</li><li>I wish they had plain rice.</li><li>Also, nothing comes with rice or naan.</li><li>A wonderful meal, the daily special, took us through a wonderful plate of appetizers, a sizzling plate of prawns, butter chicken, aloo gobi, naan and rice, then dessert.</li><li>I am impressed with everything they have, the rice, thin slices of potatoes, the chicken, but most of all the lamb.</li><li>As accompaniments, you have the option to choose between fries, rice or salad or a mix.</li><li>I ordered half and half of the fries and rice.</li><li>The rice is nothing special but it tastes great and is well prepared so I have no complains here.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
