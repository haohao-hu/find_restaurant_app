<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 14' %><h2>rolls<br />occurrence: 446</h2><div><ol><li>We got some dim sum orders: shrimp roll, veggie dumpling, veggie spring rolls, chicken spring rolls, pork with black bean sauce, crispy chicken &amp; chicken Sho Mai along with some veggie fried rice.</li><li>Anyway, we liked all the rolls, the crispy chicken &amp; fried rice.</li><li>Between the 3 of us we shared a few rolls and got a sizzling hot plate of spicy chicken.</li><li>We ended up ordering 8 rolls most of which were decent and fairly priced.</li><li>My friend had the daily special, which was shrimp tempura, bulgogi, salad, some rolls and I believe rice, there was also miso soup for only $ 7.95.</li><li>I had something from their lunch menu which came with some rolls and sushi, it was more than enough and it was $ 8.95, which is pretty decent.</li><li>The sushi boat, rolls and sashimi salad was amazing.</li><li>- Sushi was so so ... especially the rolls were not too good.</li><li>I had the sashimi lunch special which is $ 9.95 and which came with soup, salad, 12 pcs of sashimi and 8 small rolls.</li><li>I requested that the sashimi and the rolls all be salmon.</li><li>Actually it was my husband that suggested we go in, and once inside we faced a huge board with about 40-50 different types of rolls, hence the name.</li><li>There were the regular raw sushi rolls, and they also had cooked rolls and vegetarian rolls.</li><li>We ordered mushroom egg foo young, spring rolls, spicy eggplant in black bean sauce sauce with tofu, mixed vegetables, vegetable lo mein, vegetable fried rice, and mushroom egg drop soup.</li><li>Okay so bento is a no go, what about some good rolls ?</li><li>Dragon roll ( shrimp tempura, mayo and cucumber) is $ 9.50- okay kind of expensive but not too bad- but hey about a small slice of salmon on top of the rolls ( as in the pictures) ? $ 15.50 !!?!?!?</li><li>My spicy salmon wraps ( which, just to clarify, consisted of four small rolls wrapped in rice paper, which were the size of regular rice sushi) cost 13.00.</li><li>At about $ 8.50 each, you get soup, salad, 16 rolls, and in the winter they add 2 takoyaki, dumplings, or spring rolls.</li><li>At about $ 8.50 each, you get soup, salad, 16 rolls, and in the winter they add 2 takoyaki, dumplings, or spring rolls.</li><li>They also cheated out on the amount of fish on the rolls.</li><li>Overall the cooked food is very good, the rolls lack flavour, and for 8.50- 10 for the specialty rolls, they were very small- all you can eat size.</li><li>Overall the cooked food is very good, the rolls lack flavour, and for 8.50- 10 for the specialty rolls, they were very small- all you can eat size.</li><li>The color was kind of off- all sashimi had a warm taste and it was covered in water- it just did n't taste pleasant, we ordered a second round of sashimi .. same thing Rolls- Our roll order was forgotten on the FIRST ticket .. mmm .. we ordered their signature roll .. it was really meh .... and the nori was chewy handroll- the Nori was very soft when it came ... portion of rice to filling .. rice more .. filling a bit .. no good Hot Food- beef roll enoki, and green onions, short ribs, grilled shrimp, grilled cutlet, grilled mushroom, grilled beef, grilled chicken heart, etc etc ( The shrimp did not taste fresh again) but overall the beef were all pretty good! ( or 2nd order some of the grill items were once again forgotten !!!! they were n't even full for the evening !!)</li><li>Ironically, this rice was considerably more like sushi rice than the rice they used in their rolls.</li><li>There are many items but nothing was out of the ordinary, except for the many rolls .... with absolutely zero descriptions.</li><li>The assortment of rolls were nicely presented and were fresh and tasty.</li><li>The rolls looked neat and tidy.</li><li>Totally brilliant- we tried salmon, toro, albacore tuna and fluke as well as several rolls.</li><li>The menu was large with tons of combos, platters and specialty rolls.</li><li>We had an assortment of rolls and sashimi, all were fresh and well made.</li><li>Much more fresh and I feel like the chefs put more care into slicing sashimi and making rolls.</li><li>Special house salad, tataki rolls, lion head sushi rolls, and combination #3.</li><li>I came here from referral of a foodie, and I 'm surprised from the wide selection of rolls, they are good.</li><li>We ordered some special veggie rolls that I do n't remember the name of ... but my problem was that the rolls were SO BIG !!!</li><li>We ordered some special veggie rolls that I do n't remember the name of ... but my problem was that the rolls were SO BIG !!!</li><li>I could barely chew the rolls and the crispy things on the rolls scraped the top of my mouth lmao ...</li><li>I could barely chew the rolls and the crispy things on the rolls scraped the top of my mouth lmao ...</li><li>But I 'll probably go back but not order special rolls ...</li><li>Got the sushi/sashimi combo and for $ 50 + ( tax tips not included) all we got were very ordinary pieces of rolls and fish.</li><li>The fish tasted hard and frozen and the rolls were okay, ayce quality.</li><li>The sashimi sushi maki combo included some big pieces of sashimi, but the rolls ( spicy salmon &amp; spicy tuna) were just disgusting.</li><li>The fish was not fresh and the crunch was soggy ( why even include crunch if you are just going to premake these rolls hours ago, the crunch just makes it taste greasy and adds a bunch of calories).</li><li>Between the four of us we ordered mostly maki rolls nicely presented on rectangular plates with veggie garnish cut into butterflies.</li><li>Their rolls are decent, not the best I 've had but made fresh.</li><li>We also ordered three rolls, Spicy Killer ( i think ?) which Mr. H and I assumed was shrimp tempura on the inside but the entire roll was deep fried ( makes me think the menu is very clear).</li><li>Although we came `` not hungry'', we each ordered a full entree plus 3 rolls, 3 appetizers, and a sashimi small to share.</li><li>Sushi rolls- tataki, crazy, and French kiss rolls- all extremely tasty!</li><li>I would say that even though the rolls were good they lacked the extra flavour you expect with spicy.</li><li>I 'm not going to go into which rolls we ordered because they were all really good.</li><li>The rolls were delicious and they give you a good variety of fish and rolls.</li><li>The rolls were delicious and they give you a good variety of fish and rolls.</li><li>So wanted to give their rolls and nigiri a chance.</li><li>There were a number of special/unique rolls that I have n't seen anywhere else.</li><li>The sashimi was really fresh and the rolls were a bit smaller-sized but they tasted great.</li><li>We ordered the small sashimi set, 2 specialty rolls and a hamachi appetizer and we were decently full, but not stuffed.</li><li>Some might call the rolls small, but this is the size sushi is supposed to be -- if you have to bite into it, or it 's a struggle to put in your mouth, it 's not thoughtfully made sushi.</li><li>I got a sashimi dinner, a selection of a la carte sashimi, beef sashimi, and several rolls.</li><li>I like their rolls, especially the torched ones.</li><li>But, my boyfriend said there was a bit too much rice on the rolls ...</li><li>I thought to myself that maybe their cooked dishes just was n't their forte and that their sashimi and rolls would make up for it.</li><li>The rolls did n't make it any better, it was tiny, filled with fake crab meat and drizzled in an overly strong sweet sauce.</li><li>The rolls were spectacular also.</li><li>Tried a combination of basic and specialty rolls- may be the best we 've ever had.</li><li>The sashimi was OK but the rolls were pretty awesome.</li><li>The rolls are great.</li><li>2 rolls and 90 piece combination platter to share with 5 people.</li><li>I was not dissatisfied with the rolls I ordered but they did not blow me out of the water, which left me a bit disappointed given the relatively high prices charged for maki.</li><li>Some rolls were massive and others smaller so I did enjoy the variety.</li><li>I 'd wish green tea would be hotter and there would n't be a TV screen visible from no matter where you sit, but other than that, the service so far has been fast and attentive, no plastic plates or cups, the fish is very fresh, rolls are of good size and nicely presented.</li><li>We ended up eating a bunch of rolls anyways because they were soo good.</li><li>However the rolls were very satisfying and delicious as well as the calamari! ( best fried calamari we 've ever had) Service was very good, always attentive and made sure we had tea/water and never felt disrespected/rushed.</li><li>Usually cheap rolls = tempura and/or avocado filler.</li><li>We ordered a dynamite roll, spicy salmon and crazy roll I think ( the one with spicy scallop) Rolls were all fresh and tasted good.</li><li>For the price, I think the size of the rolls was a bit on the smaller size.</li><li>The crablet is my favorite, the rolls, and the fish are beyond expectation.</li><li>This included fried Tofu, a salad, far more vegetable tempura than one person can eat, and a few California rolls.</li><li>They have some creative rolls that are really good.</li><li>The menu does n't have an extensive selection of meals as other Viet restaurants but they do have the basics of spring rolls, pho ( beef and chicken), pho beef stew, rice and noodles.</li><li>I had the spring rolls today; 4 huge rolls ( HUGE) for $ 6.</li><li>Spring rolls were crispy and full of goodness.</li><li>Overall, i give 3.8 stars, is not THAT great that i would miss it but i will come again to try their rolls.</li><li>Having been to one other Spring Rolls location in the past, my findings were; the place can cook just about anything to a tolerable degree, except for spring rolls.</li><li>We tried tempura shrimps, tom yum and black pearl rolls.</li><li>We really like the rolls.</li><li>Maybe it 's the tornado rolls ... maybe it 's the mouth watering summer rolls.</li><li>Tornado rolls are those shrimps wrapped in a batter that looks like a tornado.</li><li>And sexy summer rolls are the non-fried ones- they have avocado, lettuce, crab or shrimp, other greenery and come wrapped in a see through rice paper. yummmmzeeerrrzzzzz The staff at the Sheppard and Yonge location are super nice.</li><li>My first experience at spring rolls and I am never going back.</li><li>I found better spring rolls in a tiny shop down the street.</li><li>Sexy summer rolls should be renamed ' lettuce rolls' as that 's all that seems to be in them ( note, these are the non-fried option).</li><li>My adult daughter and I ordered three different rolls and all were excellently prepared, fresh and very delicious.</li><li>Yes this place is a bit on a the pricey side ( $ 9-13 for 6-8 huge rolls) but it is worth it.</li><li>Quality of sushi is amazing, they have unique and tasty rolls, good service, and you can sit back and relax for as long as you like.</li><li>The rolls were slightly warm, but you could tell it was freshly made on the spot.</li><li>I would definitely go again to try out their other rolls:) When I immediately smile and have a huge grin on my face, you know it 's good haha.</li><li>I 've had all of the vegetarian rolls ( yasai is my favorite!) and I really enjoy the vegetarian bibimbop.</li><li>It came with spring rolls, chicken and beef skewer along with some meat pieces.</li><li>Just noodle with some vegetables, no soup but with some spring rolls and meat.</li><li>A few of my favourites off the top of my head ...- avocado milkshake- pho with beef balls and rare beef- chicken pho- banh cuon- spring rolls ( or egg rolls, whatever you want to call it)- com tam This place is small for the amount of customers dining and waiting to get into the restaurant.</li><li>We also ordered the noodle rolls with minced meat.</li><li>Spring rolls are also extra meaty the smoothies are made with real fruit.</li><li>Went to this place for lunch, only cost me $ 11 for noodle and California rolls as lunch combo, the waitress also served a fired fish, so that is a good deal.</li><li>Some of the rolls were definitely better than some others.</li><li>The rolls were amazing!</li><li>Really enjoyed the Maki- nice and fresh fish, and the specialty rolls are very well done.</li><li>Good amount of fish on the rolls too.</li><li>Specialty rolls are unbelievably delicious.</li><li>The portions were more than generous, and the rolls had a great rice to filling ratio.</li><li>My set included california rolls, avocado rolls, and a salmon hand roll.</li><li>Anyway, I ordered a roll set ( 2 rolls, plus salad and soup)!:) I could n't finish everything.</li><li>The rolls are really good here.</li><li>The sushi rice was hot for rolls.</li><li>DO order the rolls and the sashimi, the fish tastes fresh and you get good value for the price paid.</li><li>What I had: Boston roll, Philadelphia rolls, Tempura rolls, miso soup, wakame salad and edemame.</li><li>What I had: Boston roll, Philadelphia rolls, Tempura rolls, miso soup, wakame salad and edemame.</li><li>The rolls were just what you expect to get at almost any decent sushi place.</li><li>I ordered `` Take'' which includes 12 assorted types of nigiri sushi ( sashimi on rice) w/ 3 California rolls.</li><li>Honestly, skip this deal and get more nigiri sushi, you can get the rolls anywhere.</li><li>The rolls are nicely decorated.</li><li>Most rolls are above $ 10.</li><li>Their rolls are light on the rice and their sashimi is very fresh.</li><li>Special rolls are on average $ 12.00 but they 're very filling so for some people one is enough.</li><li>Also I think that if you pay $ 15 for two small rolls it is n't unreasonable to expect more than 2 pieces of ginger and less than a dime size of wasabi.</li><li>I heard the special rolls were good here, so we went and ordered 5 of them- spider and dynamite which was part of a combo plate, Chicago, Yoko special, and the spicy scallop roll.</li><li>We have done this at many other restaurants and have enjoyed doing this as some of us really like the rolls.</li><li>At most places special rolls are different but Yoko 's special rolls are all identical, with tempura yam, avocado, cucumber, tobiko being present in all the rolls we ordered minus the spicy scallop.</li><li>At most places special rolls are different but Yoko 's special rolls are all identical, with tempura yam, avocado, cucumber, tobiko being present in all the rolls we ordered minus the spicy scallop.</li><li>The rolls itself were actually pretty good, there is n't too much rice, and the shrimp tempura, soft-shell crab and the yam tempuras were all nice and crispy.</li><li>But I must say that the biggest problem here at Yoko, was that all those rolls were absolutely drenched with a sweet soy-based sauce, making the rolls slightly soggy and masking the flavour and textures of the rolls.</li><li>But I must say that the biggest problem here at Yoko, was that all those rolls were absolutely drenched with a sweet

absolutely drenched with a sweet soy-based sauce, making the rolls slightly soggy and masking the flavour and textures of the rolls.</li><li>We told the staff the sauce was overwhelming and the rolls were way too similar to each other but was told that customers wanted more sauce and that if they did n't want sauce to indicate when ordering, but there was no way to know this beforehand.</li><li>The lady that took our order did tell us that the rolls would taste similar but I did n't expect that four of the five of the rolls would turn up identical from each other.</li><li>The lady that took our order did tell us that the rolls would taste similar but I did n't expect that four of the five of the rolls would turn up identical from each other.</li><li>The rolls are all presented well on wooden tablets and usually have some sauce laced along the side for decorative and taste-complimenting purposes.</li><li>I recently discovered why these rolls were so big and why they tasted a bit different and it 's because they put pieces of sweet potato inside.</li><li>Overall: I would n't say I 'm a regular here but it is one of my go-to Japanese restaurants when I 'm craving good rolls.</li><li>Maki set The maki sets contain large rolls but the rolls are similar so it almost feels like you ordered one type of roll.</li><li>Maki set The maki sets contain large rolls but the rolls are similar so it almost feels like you ordered one type of roll.</li><li>Everything tasted average, The rolls are big, very little rice, almost too much ingredients inside and I 'm not sure all the flavours worked together.</li><li>At Ginza Sushi, this would actually qualify for 2 orders ( 8 rolls).</li><li>The only complain is that the presentation of the rolls ... looks like prepared in a rush.</li><li>Wont be running back here, the chef needs to take pride in the sushi he is making, and not put out such small rolls.</li><li>First time have dinner there with my husband, we ordered a dinner for two which comes with wings &amp; rolls to start, then a combination plate with BBQ chicken &amp; pork, and we asked for upgrad a steam rich into garlic rich ..... the BBQ meats are very good condition, a man who looks very nice and I believed he is the owner of the restaurant told me they fresh cook the food by order, no msg ~ ~ that 's a good selling point.</li><li>The Fresh Rolls are yummy too and a great appetizer to help get you started on your cure to your hangover.</li><li>Spring rolls and the rice sticky buns with shrimps are great appetizers.</li><li>Deep fried spring rolls are fishy and the pho was salty.</li><li>I normally order the Pho dac biet and spring rolls because I enjoy being basic at times ... but hey, you ca n't go wrong with the Special, and without the spring rolls the meal just does n't seem complete.</li><li>I normally order the Pho dac biet and spring rolls because I enjoy being basic at times ... but hey, you ca n't go wrong with the Special, and without the spring rolls the meal just does n't seem complete.</li><li>Service: quick and they always take my `` special'' order without any issue Ambience: the restaurant is always busy with many tables but the turnaround time is quick, you usually dont have to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated Food: we always order the shrimp fresh rolls and PHO, everytime it 's fresh but the soup broth is the reason why we come here ... its light, not oily ( like some of the other locations) and TASTY!</li><li>Spring rolls are a must, done right the Vietnamese way.</li><li>The fresh rolls with shrimp and pork also good, pork was sliced thin enough unlike some places too thick.</li><li>Rice noodle rolls are the best!</li><li>Hand rolls were just amazing, sea weed erryday !!</li><li>The food here is great too, I especially like how their sushi, rolls and hand rolls are not stuffed with excessive rice like most AYCE places!</li><li>The food here is great too, I especially like how their sushi, rolls and hand rolls are not stuffed with excessive rice like most AYCE places!</li><li>Bento boxes, fried rice, ramen/udon, and rolls ... like over 168 items or something.</li><li>We tried a lot of their rolls as well.</li><li>The food &amp; selection ( 4.5/5): Sashimi was fresh, the cooked meat was alright, but the rolls were definitely well done in terms of flavour and rice vs. Fish ratio: P A couple things of reasons why I thought this place differed from many other AYCE.</li><li>1) their rolls are a lot smaller than most AYCE places, but this is n't necessarily a bad thing.</li><li>They are still well done only on a smaller scale so I got to try more rolls than I usually eat at another AYCE place.</li><li>My dislikes- all sushi rolls, the rice was too sticky sometmes gooey, too much vinegar, the rolls with crunchy bits had tons uncooked PANKO which tasted nasty- youre suppose to cook your tempura bits and if you use PANKO please fry it with butter first, panko straight from the box is just bread crumbs.</li><li>To sum everything up, I would definitely come back even though I will not be ordering sushi rolls, there were many items on their menu I loved other than the rolls, lets just hope I receive them hehehehe.</li><li>They have a wide variety of sushi, rolls, appetizers, grilled, and desserts ( the dessert menu is great).</li><li>Rolls were better than most AYCE I 've tried and were roughly the same size as ordering at a non-AYCE.</li><li>Food here is definitely portioned out for people to sample- the rolls are tiny ( maybe half the size ?) not just by pieces but also by diameter of fillings!</li><li>But for those who love noodle, regular rolls, and all the tempura, side dishes etc. this would be the ideal place to feast!</li><li>Our table ordered signature AYCE items such as rolls, hand rolls, ramens and udons, and yes, sushi/sashimi.</li><li>Our table ordered signature AYCE items such as rolls, hand rolls, ramens and udons, and yes, sushi/sashimi.</li><li>The sushi though aside from the salmon all tasted not super fresh, however the rolls are nicely made!</li><li>It has the standard fare of sashimi, rolls, hot foods, cold apps, dessert and drinks, just as it does with forgetful service and not serving you 100% of what you asked for.</li><li>Food Quality: 7 Service: 8 Again .. all the sushi and and maki rolls were all pretty standard.</li><li>The rolls are not uniform, sloppy, and somehow the combination of things they put into the rolls are disgusting.</li><li>The rolls are not uniform, sloppy, and somehow the combination of things they put into the rolls are disgusting.</li><li>There are tons of cucumbers in all the rolls and a sliver of fish.</li><li>They have some very good speciality rolls, I love the mango rolls and the soft shell crab rolls.</li><li>Same overall quality of food, more variations of rolls, and slightly lower kids prices.</li><li>The rolls come with pretty small pieces but this just means more stomach room to eat other rolls!</li><li>The special rolls were nice ( ordered mango tango, crazy dragon, black dragon, soft shell crab) but then they fill you up quite quickly so I suggest to fill up on the good stuff ( sashimi and such) first before getting too much of the rolls.</li><li>Rose rolls are the best.</li><li>I really wanted and could not taste enoki rolls, the reason to try this restaurant.</li><li>Overall, this AYCE serves good quality sashimi, sushi, rolls and grills.</li><li>As far as specialty rolls, the Sexy Summer Roll was an interesting one with nice flavor.</li><li>The sashimi and specialty rolls were all fresh and delicious.</li><li>Have some business sense. the best sushi ever, the most unique rolls, quality ingredients, excellent staff and service, must come back !! puts sushi on the level of heaven.</li><li>Loved all the different kinds of rolls especially the Sexy Summer Roll and Dynamite Roll.</li><li>Such as i ordered 16 salmon flowers they only served 8 with little to no rice in the flower; ordered 4 pieces of flounder they brought us 2; I ordered 2 pieces of salmon teriyaki, bbq cream mushrooms, they never served us; I ordered 5 rolls they brought us 4.</li><li>Other than a few `` house'' rolls and sashimi, the menu is n't that restricted for lunch.</li><li>Recommendations: Scallop sushi and scallop sashimi Beef ribs ( which are cooked to a very pleasing medium-rare) Herb white tuna sashimi Eggplant tempura Avoid: Sushi Legend fried rice Sake mussel ( dry, tough, over-salted) Crazy dragon roll TL; DR Efficient service, great grill items, simple menu items shine over heavily-seasoned and sauced rolls and entrees.</li><li>Seafood noodles did n't have much content, vegetarian spring rolls were good but a little on the expensive side.</li><li>Spring rolls are delicious.</li><li>The rolls were rather large but the server brought us as scissor to cut in half.</li><li>My spring/fresh rolls were $ 7.50 Service: only 1 waitress working.</li><li>I personally like the following dishes:- Spring rolls ( very very crispy_- fried butter chicken wings ( Juicy, and butterly tasty)- vietnam style pancake What 's else:- You ca n't really comment on the service, you know why,- I do n't like the fact that there are tables right besides the washroom ( this is just personal preference).</li><li>This evening my husband ordered the Salmon Teriyaki bento box which came with 6 California rolls, yaki mandu as well as your typical soup, salad and rice.</li><li>I had some of Grandpa 's rolls, and the rice was a tad too soft).</li><li>They have a great collection of dishes with soup/salad/spring rolls appetizers for less than $ 10.</li><li>Pho Huong Trang makes some pretty lame cold rolls ( they did n't hit you with that refreshing feeling you generally get), there was no coriander in ANY of the dishes we ordered, and to add insult to injury, the green tea was barely lukewarm -- that 's just offside!</li><li>More choices of rolls does not mean all the choices are delicious.</li><li>Free: miso soup, tofu appetizer Bento box: tempura ( good), salad ( meh), 6 california rolls ( good), chap jae ( ok), bulgogi ( ok) My friend told me their chirashi is good and that their fish is really fresh.</li><li>On the rolls we ordered, the rice was undercooked and the avocado in the rolls ranged from barely ripened to completely raw and crunchy-chewy.</li><li>On the rolls we ordered, the rice was undercooked and the avocado in the rolls ranged from barely ripened to completely raw and crunchy-chewy.</li><li>After complaining, the rolls were replaced, but were equally bad.</li><li>Their spicy salmon hand rolls are to die for.</li><li>I 've been here more than 10 times for sashimi, maki, hand rolls and Ha Da Bap ( the sashimi with lettuce and seaweed on rice).</li><li>We 've had pad thai, various curries, cold rolls, basil beef and all were well prepared and flavourful without the high sodium/ msg.</li><li>I got the vegetable udon that filled most of me up and we also ordered some veggie rolls.</li><li>The sashimi is thick and fresh and the rolls were delicious.</li><li>Both rolls together were a little over $ 20.</li><li>The rolls were yummy yummy.</li><li>My girlfriend had the cold rolls, which were nice and fresh, but I think had a little too much carrot in it.</li><li>Plus to top it off it was unseasonably cold that night and we were stuck on the patio for 1.5 hours waiting for spring rolls.</li><li>NEVER AGAIN WILL I BE EATING AT LINDA 'S Grand total for a horrible night = $ 71.23 for two people two mains and a half liter of wine .... they comped the spring rolls .... nice enough but my tummy is still killing me ... that 's my 2 cents for ya .... follow it and you 'll save yourselves a DOLLAR.</li><li>Ordered the goi cuon ( garden rolls), very typical and decently done.</li><li>The rolls were average at best.</li><li>We always get the Japan Sun rolls they are our favorite and once again it did not dissapoint.</li><li>Rolls were decent but kind of bland.</li><li>Lastly, taste-wise, the sushi, sashimi, rolls and beef steaks were decent at best.</li><li>I ordered off of the gold menu which includes sashimi and all the other various rolls.</li><li>Many of the rolls were borderline disgusting.</li><li>Everything had a funny taste to it and all the rolls we ordered came out sloppy.</li><li>Maybe the guy making the rolls was overworked ?</li><li>- I wish there is more nigri .. instead of just 4 and the rest were all rolls The interior is nice and clean.</li><li>The quality of the sashimi was quite good and the sizes of the rolls are just right.</li><li>Fish doesnt taste as fresh and bland rolls.</li><li>The rolls are nicely made.</li><li>I have seen rolls from other places looking messy but this one was great.</li><li>Our group ordered a large number of rolls, and they all came on one plate.</li><li>Rolls were decent.</li><li>We were told that it was a main dish, and that they served grilled items and rolls before they served mains, and that it was coming.</li><li>Spring rolls are smaller than their competitors.</li><li>Singapore style noodles have just the right amount of spice, noodle rolls, donut sticks and congee are all just right and brought out fast.</li><li>Spring rolls were good.</li><li>As per my previous comment, the rolls are huge.</li><li>Upon dissection, the dinosaur sized rolls may be attributed to the tamago ( egg) that is stuffed inside.</li><li>The take out was very fast and cheap and the rolls of course were huge!</li><li>I 've been a loyal Sushi Bong customer for about a year now after a friend of mine suggested I give them a try because of their huge rolls.</li><li>Dynamite rolls are also tasty, to note.</li><li>There 's even salmon in their California rolls!</li><li>I was most impressed w/ the size of the rolls ... it was ENORMOUS: D The price is n't bad either!</li><li>But wow ... great rolls esp the spider roll: D.</li><li>I would suggest to always go for their special rolls, my ranking of my favorite rolls over there:- Rainbow- Moon River- Hard Rock- Beef- Spider.</li><li>Its steady eddie rolls.</li><li>For rolls they are decent so go nuts.</li><li>If you want to do it Korean style, pay .50 more and get the cho- jang, korean hot sauce for your rolls.</li><li>Roll fish into, umm rolls and call it Maki ...</li><li>The nigiri and the rolls were no better.</li><li>First of all our rolls were ready at lightening speed and we both ordered 3 different ones.</li><li>As stated in previous reviews, the rolls are humongous.</li><li>I 'd rather they make two small rolls instead.</li><li>This place has huge rolls and it 's definitely enough food.</li><li>The food was ok, their rolls are huge! the food is very much affordable.</li><li>The quantity is very good for rolls and sushi.</li><li>Of the three rolls the best was the Spicy Salmon roll. which was crunchy and had the right amount of spicy as well salmon was good in it.</li><li>The rolls are HUGE though ... so it is worth the price I guess, but they are hard to squeeze in your mouth!</li><li>Their rolls are gigantic and their tempura roll is surprisingly tasty.</li><li>Skip the thinly sliced sashimi of `` meh!'' quality and go for the rolls instead.</li><li>Huge rolls.</li><li>The rolls are massive and yummy.</li><li>The rolls are huge.</li><li>They made three rolls for us in 5 minutes on Christmas Day.</li><li>The rolls were huge which will definitely fill you up.</li><li>The sashimi tasted fresh, good quality and the rolls were great, it 'll definitely satisfy your craving.</li><li>Used to be much better when Mr. Bong was there to serve us his handmade rolls.</li><li>Now the rolls shrunk in size.</li><li>I still come back from time to time, love their spider roll and many other rolls.</li><li>Portions are huge, the biggest rolls I have ever seen, and the quality ai n't bad either.</li><li>I recommend ordering their specialty rolls- they 're huge!</li><li>You 'll get a good bang for your buck for the moon river roll, and any of the spicy rolls.</li><li>All the rolls I 've ordered are eight large pieces each.</li><li>I think the way to go at Sushi Bong is to order rolls and not sushi/sashimi pieces.</li><li>The rolls are generous and fresh.</li><li>Both rolls were delicious!</li><li>Both rolls had a good ratio of rice to ingredients- which is a bonus for me because I hate when restaurants add so much rice and you can barely taste what is inside the roll!</li><li>My usual order consists of mostly cooked rolls such as Dynamite, Spider and sometimes the Spicy tuna or Salmon Roll.</li><li>As previous posts has mention the rolls

in quick and speedy delivery of food, bundled with overly large rolls stuffed with raw salmon or tuna, or tempura, whatever most sushi lovers desire.</li><li>Came here last night for dinner with my boyfriend and we got the set dinner for two which included hot &amp; sour soup, two spring rolls, general tao chicken, chinese brocolli, and chicken fried rice to share.</li><li>I do n't think that this is the best Chinese restaurant in the world but there is something about their egg rolls and their wonton soup that I ca n't seem to find at any other reason.</li><li>I either get beef, spring rolls and vermicelli or pho.</li><li>Also ordered the `` Cha Gio'' spring rolls that seemed to have more taro in it, which I thought were tasty but I 've been told that there are better ones elsewhere.</li><li>Small order is two large rolls.</li><li>The rolls are nothing great, but I enjoy it.</li><li>Server was in a `` loud voice'' talking to us ( feels like she 's yelling) We ordered

( yes, and that is like 8 pieces of sushi for that price) and sometimes when I feel like splurging a little for lunch, I order their spider roll for like $ 14.99 i think- which is like my favourite maki rolls and this place is generous when it comes to the soft shell crab they stuff in that shit.</li><li>Its been 1hr since I ordered make rolls and they are still making it as per the waitress.</li><li>Make rolls do n't bother.</li><li>The filet mignon set teppanyaki dinner and the Don Mills rolls are really good.</li><li>As I was eating, I noticed a few fish eggs in my rolls.</li><li>For fish eggs they use food colouring and the rolls are pathetic!</li><li>They brought cold and old dragon rolls California rolls were old staff was super rude and Bill was astronomical.</li><li>Went for AYCE sushi and did not have a pleasant experience:- Beef short ribs were n't fresh- All the rolls were falling apart- Chicken udon hardly had any chicken in it- Hand rolls were disappointing- waaay too much rice Staff decided that we ordered way too much food and kept telling us that we would n't be able to finish it.</li><li>Went for AYCE sushi and did not have a

we ordered way too much food and kept telling us that we would n't be able to finish it.</li><li>It was a special that requires a group of 8, everyone got a few maki/sushi rolls, a bowl of salad, miso soup, fried rice, a shrimp, a scallop, chicken, mixed veggies, salmon and steak.</li><li>Spring rolls were too flavorful and only had bean sprouts inside.</li><li>We ordered egg rolls, spring rolls, mushroom fried rice, General Tso 's chicken, honey garlic chicken, and a side of extra honey garlic sauce.</li><li>I brought home some rolls, garlic bread, canolli, and eclairs.</li><li>Spring rolls should not taste like any pizza!</li><li>Spring rolls were decent, and the menu is more vast compared to some other Viet places.</li><li>I always get a side of either their shrimp salad rolls or spring rolls too, which go really well with the entrees.</li><li>We had pho with rare beef ( medium), a viet pork sandwich, and cold rolls ( p2, vb1, a2).</li><li>Rolls were delicious and fresh.</li><li>We got vegetarian fresh rolls, mango salad, shrimp fried rice, and pho.</li><li>The fire grilled chicken ranges from very good, to occasionally overcooked and too dry, the fries are cheap 1/4 `` frozen fries usually over-fried and over-salted, but baked potatoes are excellent, and if you order the'' Tuesday Special `` you get a whole chicken, rolls, fries/baked or rice, and sauce for $ 18 + tax and a $ 2 delivery charge, so one really ca n't complain.</li><li>Spring rolls were a beautiful and tasty surprise!</li><li>However I still went and got the crunchy veggie rolls.</li><li>They had a smaller portion of the rolls which I liked.</li><li>Sushi, nigiri, rolls, cones all depend on a properly prepared rice base.</li><li>The avocado hand rolls were also a highlight.</li><li>Most of our rolls were falling apart as soon as we touched them.</li><li>Veggie spring rolls were delicious.</li><li>Pretty slow service, maki rolls have a little too much rice, and tempura rolls ( yam, green dragon, shrimp) are soggy.</li><li>They should be freshly fried and then put in the rolls.</li><li>The rice to fish balance for their rolls its quite good for an AYCE place.</li><li>Sashimi on the top of the rolls were fresh but the roll itself has too much rice which fills you up really fast.</li><li>We ordered some hand rolls and maki pieces and it was all rice.</li><li>I love the large selection of rolls they have.</li><li>The Rolls were huge, but only because there was so much rice stuffed into it! 3.</li><li>Maki rolls were delicious, and the hand rolls were perfectly crunchy.</li><li>Maki rolls were delicious, and the hand rolls were perfectly crunchy.</li><li>The food was ok overall. we only had a few rolls and it took 1hour from ordering to getting it, then wait for another 1hour for another roll.</li><li>I am not a fan of their rolls for sure.</li><li>Their rainbow roll was alright though ... ca n't complain about the california rolls having less fish than it is suppose to.</li><li>The rolls were a bit different as they did use quite a bit of rice for the few rolls that we did order.</li><li>The rolls were a bit different as they did use quite a bit of rice for the few rolls that we did order.</li><li>All of the things I 've tried ( sushi pizza, beef teriyaki, salmon teriyaki, various rolls) have been good.</li><li>The hand rolls were pretty dees too.</li><li>For the price one cannot complain, but there is a lot of rice in the rolls I tried, I would hope there is not so much in the non-AYCE menu.</li><li>Hand rolls are great, and tempura is crispy and batter is fresh and not overdone and drenched.</li><li>They have a good variety of rolls.</li><li>Maki rolls and hand rolls were sloppy in preparation.</li><li>Maki rolls and hand rolls were sloppy in preparation.</li><li>I 'm a big fan of grilled octopus on skewers and any maki rolls with tempura and avocados on the outside.</li><li>I enjoy how they also take the time to explain everything to us and what is in their specialty rolls.</li><li>1 table long of selection ranging from breaded shrimp, goat curry, noodles, fried rice, chicken wings, sweet and sour chicken, vegetable spring rolls, Bbq chicken and watermelon.</li><li>I had the Suyatem Plate ( $ 28), which came w/ assorted nigiri sushi ( few pieces of raw sushi, 2 rolls), assorted tempera ( shrimp, zucchini, yam), chicken yakitori.</li><li>Amongst a sea of Japanese restaurants in GTA, this place stands out by offering authentic Japanese fine dining, pure and clean Japanese food, none of the fusion/innovative rolls that you 'd find in so called sushi restaurants in trendy neighbourhoods.</li><li>Expensive but amazing rolls !!!!</li><li>They have the typical bento boxes but at the same time they also offer a long list of creative yummy specialty rolls.</li><li>The miso is the tastiest I have ever had, and the rolls and sashimi is of very high quality.</li><li>Spicy Bulgogi ( $ 8.95)- with 8 piece of spicy rolls- my DC commented that the bulgogi is a little spicy, but of course I found them to be A-OK Lunch Combo Special B ( $ 15.95)- the fish selections are just little boring: Salmon and Tuna- Good big portion but the price to match too- Shari rice is nicely prepared Waitresses here are nice and smiley, services are good and efficient.</li><li>We ordered some rolls ( avocado, unagi- Caterpillar, and mixed fish- Atlantic), the extra small sashimi party platter that comes with miso soups and green salads ( which we upgraded for $ 2.70 fee each to wakame salad), and a BBQ beef short ribs appetizer ( kalbi).</li><li>The Alaska roll was a challenge to find on a menu with so many tempura- or surimi-containing rolls, but I 'm glad it was there.</li><li>Server got our order of sushi wrong, brought two plates of Green Dragon rolls we corrected him and said we ordered one of that and one Spider Roll.</li><li>Two gourmet sets + Lobster sashimi/teppanyaki for $ 10 is the best choice for two dining there- if you are in this restaurant and order rolls, especially common stuff like California rolls, then I 'd say it 's not their fault that you have to give them 1-2 stars ...</li><li>Two gourmet sets + Lobster sashimi/teppanyaki for $ 10 is the best choice for two dining there- if you are in this restaurant and order rolls, especially common stuff like

look fresh and service is ok.</li><li>The rolls were also not very good, particularly the California roll, which consisted of mostly cucumber more than anything else.</li><li>The rolls fell apart easily when I pick it up.</li><li>A meal for about $ 15.00 will include a platter so salmon sushi and California rolls, salad, miso soup, tempura, teriyaki steak, grilled pork and the list goes on.</li><li>It 's an AYCE place for the Mongolian grill and they have a separate aisle that serves up your typical your Americanized Chinese food like your sweet so-wa pok and broccoli beef, egg rolls, and whatever you think of.</li><li>They also have the standard pre-cooked appetizers-spring rolls, dumplings, some salads, deep fried stuff, etc-nothing special.</li><li>In addition to the Mongolian BBQ section the do offer a fairly robust selection of Western Chinese faves ( you know like chicken balls and spare ribs and spring rolls) good for the us white folk who know no difference.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
