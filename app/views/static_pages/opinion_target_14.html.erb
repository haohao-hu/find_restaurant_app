<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 14' %><h2>waitress<br />occurrence: 516</h2><div><ol><li>Finally, we decided on the Beef and Barley ... but our lovely waitress took out 3 samples for us to try ....</li><li>During this hour, each person sat with empty an empty glass, until someone walked over to the bar to find the only waitress in the place, to order refills.</li><li>A young man arrived with the waitress and set one plate down.</li><li>Entr√©e #6, a burger- the waitress checked the kitchen and reported `` The chef dropped your burger on the floor.</li><li>There was only one waitress working the dining room and bar patrons.</li><li>The Buisness here has gotten better, they have a waitress here thats so nice and very sweet.</li><li>The waitress here is very helpful if you cant figure out what to eat, she can suggest many things for you.</li><li>So while I was waiting for her to get her food before I would start to eat, the waitress noticed that I was not touching my food.</li><li>The waitress looked confused, looked at the ticket, and told me that she had n't ordered anything.</li><li>The waitress apologized and went and put the order in which took about 10 minutes to come.</li><li>Everything was good except the waitress did n't understand much English.</li><li>The waitress realized that we were sharing that noodle soup, not only she got us an extra bowl ... she have the extra bowl filled with the broth!</li><li>I can understand why the service is lacking on a weekday lunch hour since there is only 1 waitress who taking orders, making drinks and desserts and delivering the orders from kitchen.</li><li>I never got a drink refill, l and a guy at the table next to mine had to get up to get a drink refill after repeatedly trying to get the waitress ' attention.</li><li>2. the waitress was nice 3. lemongrass shrimp: vegetables are very fresh and crispy, shrimps were fat and chewy 4. friend had curry beef which i found too milky taste.</li><li>I listened as one of the grandmothers tried to ask for more side plates, and the younger most likely in university waitress struggle to understand her. it 's like when we encounter other foreigners, we say things slower and louder like they will understand.</li><li>Finally another granny, speaks up in broken Mandarin saying the word `` plate'' over and over until she thinks she got the pronunciation right and the waitress nods and heads off.</li><li>Since I 'm going to China in a few weeks, I tried practicing my Mandarin with the waitress.</li><li>I think they only have 1 waitress for the whole evening and she is definitely not on par.</li><li>- My waitress put my order in wrong ... instead of Tempura Combo, she put in Shrimp Tempura ( $ 8.95)- The owner was really nice.</li><li>Went there for a Saturday Lunch, service was really slow as the restaurant was packed and they only had 2 waitress.</li><li>Finally after 25minutes of wait ( reminder this is for lunch) with no tea or soup, I was able to place my order. somehow my waitress did not serve me tea-It 's something that comes with every Sushi restaurant so I didnt ask, after my sashimi got here with no tea, I could n't find my waitress again to ask her for it.</li><li>Was brought drinks when first seated and the waitress disappeared, after asking another waitress nearby for re-fills no progress in our luck.</li><li>The waitress brought out some appetizer salads and pitas for the table, and they were really good.</li><li>I was greeted by the cute waitress ( I should mention, this place had always had very attractive service girls) who spend a whole ten seconds contemplating where to sit us in her completely empty restaurant.</li><li>POINTS: [ waitress mean like hell ] [ food not fresh ] It 's a neighborhood Japanese style restaurant owned not by Japanese.</li><li>I asked if I can use the washroom but to my SURPRISE, the waitress answered with her smile on face `` sorry it 's reserved only to our customers''.</li><li>You will see beings of all stereotypes, and if you 're lucky you might even see the waitress who is supposed to seat you.</li><li>B! tchiest waitress I 've ever had in my life.</li><li>The waitress thought the steak sandwiches were steak entrees and had to send the food back and tried to convince my friends to keep the side veggies the steaks came with instead of fries the sandwiches came with.</li><li>Bartender greeted me first before the waitress/hostess ( i do n't know if the waitress was shy but the whole time she was usually somewhere in the back).</li><li>Bartender told me to sit down and the waitress would bring me a bottle.</li><li>Decided to sit out on the patio to grab some sun and the waitress was smiley &amp; friendly &amp; served me my bottle ... she was also kind enough to let me know that the bar rail was the same price as the domestic beer.</li><li>If the waitress is so bored why does n't she make herself useful by sweeping or cleaning up a bit ?!</li><li>By the time Colorado scored their 2nd goal I had to get out of there and got up and asked the bartender for the bill ( waitress is never there ...</li><li>Here she is with the waitress ( oh look they 're friends again!) talking about how I yelled at her because the Leafs were losing lol.</li><li>I flagged down our waitress and asked if she 'd mind asking the DJ to turn it down a few notches; there were other patrons who were visibly annoyed by it as well.</li><li>The service was fine and our waitress was friendly.</li><li>The waitress ( Ashley) was very friendly, professional, and knowledgeable and answered all our questions.</li><li>I asked the waitress what types of tea they had.</li><li>It was n't until she returned with my tea did I realise how freaking cute my waitress was.</li><li>I 'm the last person to pay attention to the Women in these type of establishments, but my waitress was so super cute.</li><li>The only reason I would go back is to get the number of that gorgeous waitress.</li><li>Although it was super busy, our waitress was wonderful and catered to us well.</li><li>They lost one star because the last time I came the waitress accidentally brought my boyfriend the wrong beer.</li><li>What 's even worse is that plates of food sit for up to 20 minutes by the sushi bar before a waitress would come pick it up.</li><li>Having identified a plate as mine, I had to ask the waitress to bring it to me.</li><li>Our waitress was n't that attentive to us.</li><li>The waitress was quick to serve us and the food came really quickly!</li><li>For some odd reason the waitress was very conceded and ignore some of our requests.</li><li>Our waitress explained the menu well to us when we asked about the different combo platters.</li><li>This is the first time I tried the crazy roll and it 's pretty good.the waitress is nice too.</li><li>We walked in and was presented with a waitress to show us to our table.</li><li>The waitress was happy to serve us and was knowledgeable about the sushi.</li><li>We were here with a large group for a birthday and our waitress was Yoon Hee, I have to say, she was a phenomenal waitress, not only was she top notch at her job, her overall positive attitude and enthusiasm was really refreshing.</li><li>We were here with a large group for a birthday and our waitress was Yoon Hee, I have to say, she was a phenomenal waitress, not only was she top notch at her job, her overall positive attitude and enthusiasm was really refreshing.</li><li>I would have given this a one star but the waitress was very nice, so the extra star is for her.</li><li>The waitress was like Casper the Ghost, ca n't even remember her.</li><li>The hostess and waitress were very welcoming and we did not need our reservation ( weekday around 8pm), though with fairly limited seating you would want to play it safe and call ahead.</li><li>The older waitress was lovely, I wanted to sip tea with her while discussing what her daughter looked for in a Man.</li><li>I ordered the steak and the waitress was knowledgable of the substitutes as I did not want the gnocchi.</li><li>Oh ... did I mention the waitress never refilled my water ?!</li><li>The waitress was friendly and the service prompt!</li><li>The waitress said you must order another drink to get the 2nd lb for $ 9.</li><li>The manager is sexist however the waitress Sara was very polite and kept apologizing as if it was her fault the food we got was cold ..</li><li>The waitress was super nice.</li><li>We found this place by using Yelp and were pleasantly surprised my husband and I ordered the special and the order was done perfectly coffee was great except we had to ask waitress 4 times for creamers thankfully person at next table obliged finally got creams from waitress with our check, we will go back again probably one of the best breakfasts ever.</li><li>The customer service was 10/10, the waitress saw me struggling to eat the chicken, so she asked me if I would like her to help me open up the chicken and eat it the proper way.</li><li>The service was good, the waitress was really nice to us and she made sure we were enjoying our food.</li><li>It came out a lot faster than i thought it would! i read in other comments of wishing for a bigger menu, but if they are specializing, the argument is better quality control on what they make. there were six side dishes served with the bubbling hot soup. the chicken had glutinous rice, one piece of fresh ginseng that was full of flavour if you eat it, and one red date. caution: the date has its seed, you could hurt yourself if you bite down too fast too hard on that date. there was also one chestnut ( peeled of course) as well inside the glutinous rice. the waitress left a container lined with a plastic bag -- where chicken bones, red date seed, etc can be discarded. she also added a small dish with noodles to add into the boiling broth. chicken was slide off the bone and the glutinous rice was perfect. the chestnut seemed a little underdone, but i really enjoyed the soup, some may find it a little bland -- there is salt ( might even be sea salt) and black pepper to their soup. i liked it as it was and finished it to the last drop. side dishes: cubes of daikon kimchi, salad of lettuce woth red cabbage with this black sesame dressing, sweet soy fried xubes of potato, sweet pickled julienned slivers of daikon and carrot, marinaded fish cake with green pepper and a cucumber/zucchini marinaded with gochujang and sesame seeds etc. definitely full with a warm belly from this meal. planning this winter to come again and try other things on the menu. especially other ginseng soup options!</li><li>Service was attentive and our waitress is just so nice and pleasant.</li><li>There is this one cute waitress that is always so smiley and friendly when she serves you, it 's really heart warming:).</li><li>The food was good and our waitress was pleasant.</li><li>It was the same waitress as before.</li><li>Service was great, waitress was very attentive and friendly.</li><li>Even though the restaurant was only half-full, the waitress did not refill our teapot or take away empty dishes.</li><li>One particular waitress was especially unfriendly.</li><li>The waitress was always quick to check up on us and let us know that the banchans were refillable.</li><li>I had already been waiting at the restaurant for a good half hour before getting seated ( the waitress asked a table of 2 if they could take 1 of their 2 tables -- stacked together--why could n't you have done that when I first got to the restaurant ?) when I asked if the apps could come out.</li><li>The waitress, who probably did n't understand my request, replied, `` the apps come with the food.''</li><li>As we were trying to order, our waitress kept interrupting my Father as he tried to order, and `` shushing'' my nephew ( he is 4 and sometimes his voice is too loud), but this waitress ( I know her name, but I do n't feel like its fair to ruin her job, we will give her another chance and hope she finds herself and her soul in the future), completely RUSHED my Dad and our orders, she was so totally RUDE and it made me feel so sad that we came here on this beautiful sunny afternoon.</li><li>As we were trying to order, our

sad that we came here on this beautiful sunny afternoon.</li><li>The waitress delivered orange juice to me which was so full that she spilled it all over the table, and did n't bother to wipe it up.</li><li>Pros:- Food came really quickly and our waitress was awesome:)- Portions were huge.</li><li>I thought service was ok. disgusting. absolute shit. it taste horrible and the amount of rice they put on sushi to make you full faster ... and how thin their sashimi is ... oh did i mention that its overpriced ? the waitress is an asshole with attitude ... the manager is an asshole with attitude. horrible service. you have to pay extra for parking as well ... they wont validate it for more than an hour even though they take forever to make their food. i swear they do that on purpose ... fucking ridiculous.</li><li>Our waitress was attentive and actually behaved like a human than a robot, despite us repeatedly ordering and bugging her.</li><li>We had a really awesome waitress.</li><li>The waitress took our order when we were ready but forgot about the coffee and water, it was n't busy and everyone makes mistakes, but we had to order a second time.</li><li>Korean waitress was excited when I ordered the Cold Noodles ..</li><li>We found the waitress to be friendly, personable, helpful and attentive; a real rarity when compared to most Asian restaurants that I have visited.</li><li>Though the waitress there was polite, the other lady ( presumable the owner due to her lack of uniform) however was quite rude.</li><li>When we asked for the bill, we put our credit card on the table for a long time, then the nice waitress saw it and told us that they are debit only.</li><li>The waitress ' attitude is extremely bad, and I ordered two dishes from menu.</li><li>We decided that we wanted to order this hot and spicy dish that we recognize the name of, which is a hot and spicy broth with pig 's blood and intestines and my mom asked me what else i wanted, and I said i wanted something with vermicelli in it. we flagged down another waitress, made our orders, and asked for a dish that had vermicelli in it.</li><li>The chocolate oreo waffle was definitely over-cooked, as it was brittle ( the waitress did tell us it was though).</li><li>The server had come up to us to give us menus, and generally the service was the highlight of the place. the waitress was polite, and explained every question with patience. the part that failed them was the wait time for the food. some of their special items had run out, but at 10pm or so, right before long weekend that is to be expected.</li><li>The waitress quickly came to our table to take our order.</li><li>Also the waitress took away our service button once we ordered so there was no way for us to get their attention for water or get out bill.</li><li>I saw a tree, leaf, happy face etc. in a nice big cup. as you can see in my picture I took, not only did it not come with a little image in it, it came in a small to go type of cup. taste wise, like a vending machine but I actually did n't mind, I liked it. to the cake, do n't let my picture fool you. the size of the cake was the size of my middle and index fingers put together. taste wise, straight out of a grocery store type of cake. and not the higher end grocery stores, more like price chopper style. but again, I actually did n't mind. what I did mind was the price tag that was attached to it. it was $ 12.99 for the drink and cake combo. to recap, to go type of cup drink with vending machine taste like quality and 2 fingers size low end grocery store quality piece of cake with high end cafe prices. and I forgot to mention the table we had. we were sandwiched between 2 other tables against a half wall and had a fake plant over hang us with its fake branch half way on to our table. too bad I 'm bad a describing the actual setting we were in, should 've taken a picture ( it is worth a thousand words). so based on the above description, this place should get no more than 2 stars. but you know what, the waitress had a nice smile and was friendly. this made all the difference in the world. will I come back ... probably not. maybe it was just tonight or my luck with the food/beverage. but hard to come back here when there are so many other options in area.</li><li>Our waitress told us that because we were a party of three, if we did n't order something else, she would have to charge us an extra $ 3 service charge because we did n't each order an item.</li><li>Very limited parking in this dingy plaza ... upon entering this place we were not greeted by anyone at all, the cashier did n't even bother saying a single word, Infact the entire time at this place the only word that was spoken to us by the cashier and waitress combined is $ 15.50 ..... there goes their tip and customer service, we decided to just seat ourselves where a table had menus on it, the waitress did n't give us tea and ordering slip til 10mins later .... typically pho place that 's very cheap like $ 7 a dish depending on what you order The whole entire time I did n't hear a single word from the waitress and she looked so pissed off, did n't break a smile but oh well Mediocre food, nothing special and honestly I 've tasted better bun and com dishes elsewhere.</li><li>Very limited parking in this dingy plaza ... upon

removed my cup and replaced it with another one.</li><li>Let 's just say the focus is on the food and not on anything else. lol The service: Service was prompt, and when I asked for extra limes and basil, the waitress was n't stingy on it.</li><li>As with another great comment below; the waitress asked if all was good and told her about my awful plate and her reply was I will talk to the owner and the chef is really good.</li><li>Asked for a refill coffee and I guess the waitress was too confused and did not understand my request for another coffee.</li><li>Service wise, the waitress took forever to come around to take our order and gave off the attitude that she did n't want to be there.</li><li>The service was just excellent &amp; our waitress was very attentive.</li><li>However when my friend called to make the reservation, the waitress kept her waiting for a very long time ( 5 mins can I call this long ?).</li><li>The waitress was surly and downright unfriendly.</li><li>Our waitress was lovely and helped save the day.</li><li>I have visited the place more than 50 times and I keep wondering how they manage to always keep around the most professional of service staff, I took 4 of my office associates out for lunch and we each ordered a drink, an appetizer and a main course, waitress serving us memorized each of our orders without writing it down, while some upscale places have up to 3 people serving a table of five and would still manage to misplace or confuse an item or two per order.</li><li>The food though is really good as I shared: Charcuterie Board ( $ 14)- cured &amp; smoked meats, house made p√¢t√©, mustards, pickles, and bread While I nibbled off from my friend 's: Calamari ( $ 14)- lemon mustard a√Øoli, chilies and Shrimp Cocktail ( $ 16) Service was not the greatness this time .... our waitress was a little cold but I was too busy having a great time with my fellow yelpers to notice.</li><li>Our waitress was very attentive- so different from the last one.</li><li>Anyway, our waitress was patient and came to us a few times while we looked over the menu.</li><li>Also, the waitress we had the last time had an attitude when answering some menu questions and then we still had to call her over in order for her to take our dinner order after we 've put down the menus and she still was n't back.</li><li>In this case though I do n't think our waitress ever had any intention of asking anyone for anything for us.</li><li>Went to this place for lunch, only cost me $ 11 for noodle and California rolls as lunch combo, the waitress also served a fired fish, so that is a good deal.</li><li>Quality sashimi balanced by tasteful cooked plates, beautifully arranged plates, beautiful ambience, extensive ETOH menu, and charming chef and waitress.</li><li>Service is not the best and surprisingly the waitress was n't in a very good mood today.</li><li>I was attended to the whole time and the waitress refilled my tea without having me to ask her, and they did n't try to rush me out once I finished my meal.</li><li>The waitress was nice but seemed a bit clueless and always had to go back and forth to the kitchen when we asked questions about their menu and daily selection.</li><li>After a long wait, a waitress came from the kitchen holding an empty garbage can and placing it under her desk.</li><li>The waitress was friendly, but rather forgetful Had to ask a couple of times for a drink.</li><li>When I asked our waitress what peppercorn sauce was, she replied `` It 's like a gravy''.</li><li>Our waitress was a nice asian lady in her twenties.</li><li>We waited and waited after 10 minutes of not being offered a water we decided to leave, that 's when the waitress finally decided to come and she asked us `` are you guys okay'' as we were leaving.</li><li>When asked why it was taking so long waitress stated that diners get served faster as they made reservations.</li><li>My waitress was fast and dropped by often to make sure everything was good.</li><li>The waitress was very nice and friendly, the food was really great compare to the price.</li><li>When we entered the restaurant, it took the waitress a few minutes to acknowledge us since it looked liked they were trying to resolve a problem at the back of the room.</li><li>Our waitress was nice and pleasant but the other one did n't crack a smile but was helpful.</li><li>I actually ordered a Bagali polo which was described as vegetable rice and meat but the waitress anoyingly came back to say it is sold out two minutes after recommending it!</li><li>The waitress did not refill the tea for us.</li><li>So I did have a long look at the menu and I must have been taking too long ( 5 minutes) because the waitress came and took my drink order.</li><li>Our waitress barely spoke english and did n't really know the menu, the manager who came to explain was a bit under dressed like she was heading to a new years party in Phuket.</li><li>The waitress that was supposed to bring the rest of our order took our receipt and never returned so we had to ask another waiter.</li><li>You sit, look at a menu, then go down a corridor to order, then a waitress brings it to your table.</li><li>Our waitress at the restaurant told us that because today was a quiet night, we would be allowed to stay.</li><li>Food was good, waitress a little funny steering us certain ways ( We have Guinness, but not on tap.</li><li>Over all, a nice place but if we come back, we 'll be sure to order something different next time! ok it 's no fluke the wood oven pizza here is very good. ( we ordered two kinds to try) the dough, sauce and cheese the base ingredients of most any pizza are top notch. the crust i would describe .. it 's not a thin where it 's paper thin and it 's not cooked crisp like I 've had at many other thin crust pizza places. having its so crisp hides the true identity of the pizza dough. how can one taste the crust if it 's burnt !? the crust is thin where one can bite into the dough know it 's dough and not thick enough to not overwhelm the toppings. my quattro stagione was made wrong though .. it suppose to be separate quarters of pizza with the individual toppings. but instead it was a pizza with all the toppings. c 'mon just because I do n't look italian does n't mean I do n't know how it 's suppose to be. do n't give me stupid excuses that things get roughed up in the oven that why that make it that way ? i do n't care for the chatty waitress here and the ridiculous excuses, but as i mentioned in my first review. i will come here for the food because the cooks and chefs in the back know what they are doing ..</li><li>I like the small restaurant atmosphere and OUR waitress took care of us really well.</li><li>The waitress was just sitting around talking on the phone and occasionally would be screaming screaming with the staff in the back.</li><li>As we were eating the desserts, I commented to the waitress how delicious the strawberries served with each were, and she pointed out that they are drizzled with Cognac!</li><li>Then when the chicken is ready, the waitress would come and cut it up and serve that to you ..... then you wait again for the noodle to be cooked ... and she came back and serve you again .... then you wait for the congee to be cook, and now you have this congee that has all the nutrients from the chicken and ginseng that suppose to be really good for you ?!</li><li>The service is really really slow, but should be expected since the ginseng chicken needs to be cooked by the waitress 3 times per table, including all other tasks they have to do ( they look really tired) I have been here a few times and all at bad timings because the restaurant is always full, each time the waitress tells us it 's a really long wait and they do n't know how long, in a tune that they want you to not wait and just leave.</li><li>The service is really really slow, but should be expected since the ginseng

with the intent of leaving the tips on the table ( as I customarily do) and this waitress called me back.</li><li>They literally had 2 waitress doing stupid task like arranging the menu at the counter instead of cleaning up tables or seating customers.</li><li>Service was good the waitress girl who served our table was nice.</li><li>On second note, waitress there does not understand English.</li><li>First off, there were raw eggs ( I mean raw, running egg white!) in my food, when confronted, the waitress said it 's suppose to be that way.</li><li>Again we flagged down the waitress asking her about the blood; whether the chef had cut himself.</li><li>The waitress saw it but did not say a word, I waited for a minute and finally I have to ask for the manager.</li><li>The waitress was great.</li><li>My mom told me that waitress always takes care of them every time when they come!</li><li>Thumb up for food and that waitress !!</li><li>I asked one waitress to confirm what the flakes were and she looked at it and walked off to get another waitress.</li><li>I asked one waitress to confirm what the flakes were and she looked at it and walked off to get another waitress.</li><li>If you like it spicy, the waitress can get you the red chili paste ...</li><li>The waitress asked if we had ever been before, and was quick to make suggestions when I told her it was our first time.</li><li>My spring/fresh rolls were $ 7.50 Service: only 1 waitress working.</li><li>I specially like the way how the waitress put the chopsticks and the spoons into a bottle of hot water.</li><li>Also that Elaine K. and Jennifer K. switched positions for the night like the movie Face-Off and had our waitress CONFUSED.</li><li>Pleasantly greeted by the waitress, and even more pleasantly happy to sit down and already be served nachos and homemade salsa ( 2 types, mild and spicy), and cold lime water.</li><li>The interior design and waitress were very nice, but the food was very veryyyyy bland and mediocre!</li><li>To their credit, the waitress took it off our bill.</li><li>The waitress was nice but very rushed, being the only wait staff working on this Sat night.</li><li>Give this place a shot and I hope for the poor guy they hired another waiter or waitress: S.</li><li>Their poutine comes with cheese curds too, despite the waitress not being sure whether it did or not.</li><li>I have a bone to pick with the waitress here.</li><li>The waitress said she can credit my partner 's, because he has to drive.</li><li>I accidentally swallowed one, and there was at least one more ( I did show the waitress when she came to give us our bill, and she apologized).</li><li>When I told the waitress we never received the extra, she said she made the note in the computer.</li><li>( I was informed by another waitress at another time at this same establishment that the tzaki was an extra charge, so I know it is not against restaurant policy to inform the customers of extra charges, but this waitress just did not seem to care.</li><li>( I was informed by another waitress at another time at this same establishment that the tzaki was an extra charge, so I know it is not against restaurant policy to inform the customers of extra charges, but this waitress just did not seem to care.</li><li>When we requested to speak with a manager, the waitress returned and said he must have stepped out because they ran out of something.</li><li>Upon our departure, waitress made a comment something to the effect that she hopes this does not reflect her service.</li><li>Both times I 've been here, I 've suspected the waitress was trying to skim me on how much change I wanted back, even after I tipped her.* shrug* This place is just flat out boring.</li><li>Shaka is the best waitress they ever had and ever will have.</li><li>The waitress was friendly and even humoured my friend when he made a lame joke about working there since he wore a shirt that matched the orange of the servers '.</li><li>And its not even table cooking, the waitress was cooking on one of the dining table ( not in front of us) as if there 's no space in the kitchen.</li><li>After walking in at around 9pm on a weeknight, we waited 10 minutes before we were even greeted by a waitress.</li><li>We had to get the waitress over to take our order, even though there was only two other customers there.</li><li>My boyfriend and I walked in looked around and waited for someone to seat us and saw a waitress drinking from a mug looking disinterested in serving us later on pointing out that we can sit where ever we wanted from across the restaurant.</li><li>After a few minutes of reviewing the menu the waitress decides to bring the other menu ....</li><li>It 's VERY rare that I would write something negative about a restaurant but here is a brief description of my experience at this particular St. Louis last week: When I sat down I was immediately greeted by a waitress who put in my order for a draft beer.</li><li>They do n't have a non-alcoholic drink menu on paper, but the waitress was more than willing to let me know what they had ( although she did n't tell me the prices).</li><li>I personally thought the way the salads were presented was beautiful. really fresh fish for its low price. this sushi resaurant is actually one of the oldest in north york area since 1999 ( ? im pretty sure) when u enter, sushi bar greets u with irashaimasen and ur immediately seated by a waitress or waiter. hot green tea is usually given as soon as you seat down and after you order, some free edamame and tofu comes out. then u get the food u ordered ( fast) and ur tea is never emptied bc of the constant refill and quality checks. the place is old but i looks neat.</li><li>The waitress serving us, a party of 15, kept telling us that we tipped too little.</li><li>Our waitress was great, very attentive, do n't remember her name but she was blond short hair, pulled back in a ponytail.</li><li>The waitress told us it 's made for 2 people, which did n't make sense since 1 costed about 7 $ x2 = $ 14, is n't hot pot supposed to be a better deal ?</li><li>Dishonest waitress that tries to get people to buy more is my biggest pest.</li><li>Awesome food and we had a nice waitress.</li><li>The waitress smiled and although it was fairly busy on a Friday evening, the food, service and overall quality was top notch.</li><li>Most importantly though service was excellent; we were attended to the whole way and the waitress even explained the orders since it was our first time.</li><li>I would still recommend the restaurant but the waitress does damage the image of the store.</li><li>Although the service can be slow, it 's only because the restaurant gets super busy- something they are trying to correct given the waitress wanted signs everywhere.</li><li>We had the older waitress.</li><li>The waitress said we have to pay $ 2.99 ?</li><li>The waitress is very demanding.</li><li>Indeed, service was not impressive. most people here mentioned there was a rude young waitress.</li><li>Although our table questioned the lack of potatoes ( even when it said potato pork bone soup in Chinese on the wall menu) the waitress gave some weird explanation in English that no one understood.</li><li>The waitress asked me if my food was okay when she saw that I had n't touched my food yet ( not with a look of annoyance but more with a look of genuine concern that only Korean ahjumas seem to be able to pull off ...).</li><li>The waitress was friendly, helpful and efficient.</li><li>I left the ordering to our very charismatic waitress who was patient enough to become my pasta encyclopaedia.</li><li>Our waitress was ultra attentive, but I suppose it was because the restaurant was n't buzzing by any means.</li><li>The waitress did not pay attention to details and we often had to ask her for things ( i.e. she took away forks, did n't come back with new ones).</li><li>She was also a little bit klutzy- I felt a bit bad because I 'm not the most graceful person in the world, but I am also not a waitress!</li><li>The pizza was saggy and wet! we returned the chicken dish. and the waitress apologized many times.</li><li>Our waitress had an attitude did not once check on us or ask us how our food was, and when we asked for water, the person serving looked like he had better things to do.</li><li>The waitress readily changed the order but the manager came by and and gave her rude and confrontational two cents about the matter.</li><li>The waitress only came to our table ONCE to ask how we were doing ... and spoke very fast because she wanted to rush back to the table beside us to kiss their asses.</li><li>After being seated and chatting a bit the waitress came over and told us the kitchen was closing in 20 minutes.</li><li>Our waitress was very pleasant, and the food came quickly.</li><li>We were warmly greeted with a beautiful and sincere smile and our waitress for the evening was extremely friendly.</li><li>Jacky ( with the blondish hair and glasses) ... you are a poorly-trained waitress.</li><li>But the service was so so, the waitress who served us seemed really stressed and rushed, a bit abrasive.</li><li>Our water glasses never saw empty and the waitress went unnoticed each time she came by our table to ensure they were bottomless.</li><li>As soon as she arrived, the waitress tried to take our order, which my friend did not even have a chance to look at the menu yet.</li><li>While dining, the waitress would converse with other diners, however she never checked in on our table once, other than to whisk away plates the moment our food was done- we felt rushed the whole time and the place was n't even busy!</li><li>The waitress took away our dessert plates and promptly brought our bill, which we found rude since we wanted to talk for a few minutes.</li><li>The waitress had the nerve to come back to the table and point out that it was low tip and was n't the right percentage.</li><li>The waitress brought the dish back to kitchen and deep fried again, which came out with no blood but outside was too overcooked to bite into.</li><li>The waitress is very polite and smiling all the time.</li><li>We had a lovely waitress so no complaints there.</li><li>Not only did they NOT have Siam noodles, the service was snail paced slow, the waitress forgot our water and our spring rolls, the portions vs price were underwhelming and the experience was tasteless and expensive.</li><li>The waitress had to be summoned, for salt and peanut sauce which helped, but not enough.</li><li>Our waitress revealed that the chef was not Thai but Mexican.</li><li>Seated quickly; the waitress was attentive and easily flagged ( is n't it the most frustrating thing when it seems like all the waiters in a restaurant are giving you the silent treatment ?), and the waitress also `` forks'' the duck off the bone for the crispy duck pancakes entree, which was incredible to watch.</li><li>We totally forgot and did n't even let the staff know in advance but our waitress was great.</li><li>The waitress was incredibly polite and attentive and accommodated substituting chicken for the beef for us as we do n't eat red meat.</li><li>Overall the decor was nice if not a bit superfluous, and the waitress was pleasant, but the food was very underwhelming and not worth it.</li><li>Overall the service by the waitress was good.</li><li>The waitress should shred this for you.</li><li>If you do come here, I suggest the Golden Curry and the Beef Panang which was initially proposed by our waitress ( Beef Panang FTW! it was soooo good we ended getting 2 orders of it so I highly recommend this dish).</li><li>The waitress did not come by at any point to apologize for the wait, either.</li><li>We had a very nice waitress and she was very attentive.</li><li>The other waitress was more friendly.</li><li>When I came in, the waitress ( the only one) ignored me like I was not a customer.</li><li>The waitress put the chopsticks directly on the table which I assumed was as dirty as the menu.</li><li>Surprisingly, the waitress did n't give me the bean sprout and basil.</li><li>How was i supposed to have pho without them I asked the waitress to bring me the basil.</li><li>The waitress left us alone with the menu for so long that we thought we would walk out of the door, and she would not notice.</li><li>They have this one grumpy waitress ... did they fire her yet ?</li><li>There was only 3 of us and the waitress forgot who ordered what.</li><li>Every Lamb and Beef dish on this picture friendly menu is AWESOME. go in for a warm lamb stew or chef 's special soup in the winter, or cool garlic cucumbers in the summer. their beef or lamb chinese style pancakes are YUM -- delightfully puffy and filled with perfectly seasoned meat. their house special beef noodle soup is cravable! you can taste the time and love in the soup base. ughh so goooood .. and the hand pulled noodles are as real as they get outside of la chine. seriously ? who cooks like this anymore outside of china ? -- these are classic techniques! the decor is kind of hilarious though, a lil step up from a hole in the wall, it 's definitely clean, but it also feels like you 're in the middle of nowhere china, really really first gen. like you 've escaped the city. and nothing matches. the walls are cheerily painted like you 're walking into the plateaus deep into china, starkly contrasting the leather booths and the crazy yellow seat covers that match the trilingual waitress 's outfits ( they mainly speak mandarin, some canto, and english). the TVs are always playing old 50 's chinese black &amp; white talkies, and there are neon signs boasting great halel food! the chef is usually out and about greeting the customers- he 's won awards for his food, and i agree -- this place is seriously the best regional lamb and beef dishes that 's hit the east side of this city since ... johnny 's burgers. i highly recommend this place! because i 'd be so sad to see it go under because no one knows about it. deserves my YUM YUM approval fo sheezie;).</li><li>The lady sitting next to us complained about her dish being too spicy, where she was met by the waitress with an unexpected heartfelt response of: `` Um, I 'm SORRY ...''.</li><li>The waitress comes by to fill your tea regularly.</li><li>When we asked the waitress to pack the leftovers for us, she simply brought us two food containers and that was it.</li><li>The lone waitress was efficient and friendly.</li><li>Japanese songs in the background ... but waitress is Chinese speaking:) Be careful when hiking down the washroom ... the stairs are steep ...</li><li>The first time I ate all you can eat there they said last call was 9:45 pm so I came in at 9:30 pm the next time and the waitress told me it was last call.</li><li>The waitress said the manager was on the phone so it 'll be a few minutes.</li><li>The waitress had to serve it with both hands.</li><li>I asked the waitress to clean it, and her response was to ask if we wanted to change tables ( ?).</li><li>Fruit Flies en mass. But the BEST was when the waitress turned to walk back to the kitchen, she had two floury HAND PRINTS on her butt, one on each cheek ( as in a groin hug, I am guessing ... with the cook ?)</li><li>Service was not good as the waitress decided that her shift had ended and made us pay for the food before we even got a chance to eat it.</li><li>We were baffled to see that menu looked Lebanese and the waitress was Croatian.</li><li>And we were not happy with the waitress whom was totally NOT helpful.</li><li>Do you remember the old lady, the waitress ?</li><li>I called over the waitress and mentioned it, and she quickly returned with the same offering saying that this was how `` the kitchen'' served this item.</li><li>My friend ordered `` The Greens ' Egg White Omelette'' On the menu below all the Omelettes it states `` All omelettes served with toast and home fries'' however when the waitress took our order she told us that the omelette my friend ordered did n't get toast and home fries.</li><li>I mentioned to the waitress that I could not find a combo that came with 3 eggs, bacon, potatoes and pancakes.</li><li>The waitress was incredibly accommodating, so that was a huge plus.</li><li>Though the place was virtually empty, the waitress was inattentive.</li><li>FOOD: After the waitress dissuaded me from trying the Philly Steak, I went with `` Truffle Wild Mushroom Burger.''</li><li>I got out of this high end booth where my eyes were glued to the in booth television to flag down a waitress.</li><li>I asked the waitress if the AC was on, moments later she checked and said one of the AC in the main dining room was n't turned on because they ' forgot' to turn it on.</li><li>The waitress sat us in an odd and unfavourable location despite being the first and only customers there.</li><li>When we asked the waitress for replacements she said they were all like that then started rubbing them with a cloth from her belt and said she would just dip them in water for us.</li><li>Each time the waitress brought something erroneously, she was gone before we could tell her.</li><li>For dinner I ordered the 2lb king crab dinner market price witch was $ 86 and a lobster tail $ while we were at the table a waitress was showing a almost four lb lobster to a child I must admit looked delicious.</li><li>It is a bit hard to see the waitress.</li><li>SERVICE: 3.5/5 stars- They were initially slow to take our order but the waitress came and moved things along and our food came on time.</li><li>The waitress even puts on a bib for you so you do n't make a mess on your clothes.</li><li>We were greeted by a friendly waitress and she patiently wait for our order and answered all our questions.</li><li>Went there on a Sunday, place was packed and there was only one waitress serving the whole front side of the restaurant.</li><li>Due to the slow service, the waitress gave us complementary soups and pop which was nice- but dunno if that makes up for all the waiting.</li><li>Service was below average -- the waitress was trying to be nice and friendly but it seemed pretty fake.</li><li>Our waitress neglected us entirely, bringing our meals out at different times ... our sides did n't show up until we were halfway through our seafood and we had to ask for drink refills and missing items.</li><li>Our waitress was always available, extremely personable and did not check in too often ( something I really appreciate).</li><li>I had gone in there with the intention of ordering the chicken but when I asked how it was prepared the waitress said that it was just lightly sauteed with salt and pepper.</li><li>Your waitress will be a member of the family, and they know the place inside and out.</li><li>The service was friendly but they only had one waitress for the entire place.</li><li>The service is n't the friendliest, but it is really quick and efficient so I did n't mind at all that my waitress did n't bother with pleasantries and small talk.</li><li>They were listed as spicy but the waitress who understands English understood that I wanted it less or no spice if possible.</li><li>Only complaint was that towards the end of our dinner the waitress came by and took my condiment tray away, thinking they were going to refill the soy, salt, and peeper etc.</li><li>The waitress was nice enough to ask me what 's wrong with the plate when she saw that the entire plate was unmoved.</li><li>I had a waitress get my order wrong and when I told her that she got the order wrong she started to yell and make very rude hand gestures ...</li><li>She was the worst waitress I 've experience in a Chinese restaurant.</li><li>Guess the quality of waitress they choose are based on eye candy ( though still not that hot anyway) rather than skills.</li><li>The only good thing was that, even though they now have a MINIMUM charge per person, the waitress waived it for us this time.</li><li>We leave the place, and as we all step out the door, one of the waitress that did n't serve us comes running out and says `` Excuse me.</li><li>Are you guys leaving ? `` me:'' Yes ... we are ... `` waitress:'' Did you guys pay ? `` me:'' yes, we did .. we sat over there `` and i pointed waitress:'' Who was your waitress ????"</li><li>Are you guys leaving ? `` me:'' Yes ... we are ... `` waitress:'' Did you guys pay ? `` me:'' yes, we did .. we sat over there `` and i pointed waitress:'' Who was your waitress ????"</li><li>Service is under average, no smile at all from any of the waitress.</li><li>The waitress never smiled once, gave one of my friends rice instead of noodles ( or maybe it was her fault), and even after confirming our question if whether or not dinners come with desserts or not, STILL did n't give us our desserts!</li><li>As I approach the 3rd plate of mashed potato, the waitress cut me off ...</li><li>We ordered the original spicy since not everyone on the table can handle the heat, but a friend of mine loves the burn so we asked the waitress to bring us a side of the special joon 's spicy sauce.</li><li>After our Dak Gal Bee ( chicken, veggies, with extras of rice sticks, sweet potato and seafood) was mostly done, our waitress added white rice and made a delicious fried rice dish on the wok using the remaining sauce.</li><li>We had to ask for water more than once, and the waitress had trouble understanding our order because English was n't her first language.</li><li>It could also be because the waitress could n't understand me.</li><li>Some waitress will give you refills on appetizers and some will be putting you off like they do n't want to give you any.</li><li>As my partner and I talked, the waitress prepared our food in less than fifteen minute!</li><li>You have to pour yourself water- I realized that only after asking for tea- the waitress pointed me towards the plastic cups on the side.</li><li>Another thing that drags this place down for me a bit is the tall female Korean `` waitress'' /cashier who works there.</li><li>This is your answer Hand made and pulled noodles with a wide variety of options to serve all tasted Pretty much every bowl is under ten bucks so not a tough decision to make However there is only seating for 14 customers so it 's a bit of a bolt hole but worth the wait to grab a seat Great service and great food My dish had wide flat noodles and had the right amount of chew to them and it 's a huge portion All ingredients were fresh and it felt odd I was the only gaijin in the place where the waitress kept trying to explain to me how to eat ..... no I know chopsticks yeah h-mart yes noodles .... hahaha.</li><li>And bam .. waitress who took my order repeated my order in English lol imagine how embarrassed I felt .. guess my Mandarin does suck!</li><li>The waitress even confirmed our order again by repeating everything exactly.</li><li>The waitress tells my sister that the food will come out in about 5 minutes.</li><li>So this stupid waitress forgot to put our order in even after confirming our order to us the first time.</li><li>However the excited hustle bustle inside the cozy restaurant kept me captivated &amp; I insisted on eating in even though the waitress struggled with where to put me and asked if takeout was an option.</li><li>Minimal A/C and the single waitress is super busy so there 's a bit of wait there too ...</li><li>The waitress came to ask me whether everything was okay, and I said to her ( with my mouth full of pasta): `` MORE SPRITE!''</li><li>When we asked for help or to take an order, the waitress would ignore us and just say ' later'.</li><li>A waitress came up and we were promptly seated and presented with these ghastly menus, with cartoon depictions of, presumably, a Peking man in various states of labour ( labour as in work, not Chinamen giving birth!).</li><li>We tried to make an eye contact with our waitress or who ever were near us at the time, Haha no way !!</li><li>Before it was delivered to portable, i saw a waitress pouring water in the dish and stirring it.</li><li>She also said that this is a `` common'' practice but I have never ever seen a waitress in another Chinese restaurant doing that.</li><li>Seasoning, changing the temperature of the dish- that 's the chef 's job and it should not be altered by a waitress.</li><li>Then you kind of just stand there and look around for a seat, many of which have a super tiny reserved sign on them that you can barely see and if you accidentally sit down at one such table, be prepared to be snapped at by a waitress that you CAN NOT SIT THERE.</li><li>The waitress demonstrated how to make the lettuce wraps ( multiple times, to note).</li><li>We ended up tipping about 10% of the bill, the waitress chased after my sister and told her explicitly that she did n't tip 15%.</li><li>When we walked in, the middle aged waitress did n't want to acknowledge us and was so unfriendly while seating us.</li><li>Guess what, the waitress said you have to give more !!!!</li><li>A waitress walks by twice and does n't even look our way.</li><li>We were immediately seated and the waitress was just sitting for the front waiting for people.</li><li>The young waitress seemed super sweet and, people, you know there is a buzzer right ??</li><li>It took ages to flag down a waitress to put in our order and much longer to flag one down for the bill.</li><li>As many other people on Yelp have already alluded to, service is lacking and the waitress were, I hate to say it, but downright rude.</li><li>The waitress do n't really pay attention to the people when they are trying to get her attention.</li><li>Our waitress was extremely nice and coherent, knew every item like the back of her hand, and made some good suggestions.</li><li>Service: Our waitress ( who also worked behind the counter) was sweet and generally efficient on a busy Friday night.</li><li>It was nice of the waitress to keep refilling our waters even though we were done eating.</li><li>The waitress is so nice to serve.</li><li>Nothing really stood out about this place except maybe the waitress.</li><li>Service was also good, the waitress was very friendly.</li><li>Service was very good and the waitress checked on us frequently.</li><li>It was n't overly busy but for some reason the waitress avoided taking our order for almost 15 minutes but had no problem refilling the water glasses at the table beside us several times.</li><li>The waitress then hurried back behind the counter and talked to the other waitress and quickly brought my dish.</li><li>The chairs were flipped upside down onto table so when the staff put chairs down to sit us, we got concerned and had to clean our own table and utensils.- waitress was VERY rude, she sat us on the inner end of a long table facing a wall where it wAs impossible for my friend to get in and out with people on the outer end.</li><li>If you 're big on having a smiling waitress who will gladly answer any questions you have about pho and Vietnamese, this is not your place.</li><li>When we checked with the waitress, it seemed that the chef might have forgotten our orders.</li><li>Around 500 items IIRC and you have to write down what you want on the little note pad on the table and hand it to the waitress.</li><li>So ca n't really give them more than 2 stars for the anti social waitress that served ... erhm or did n't serve us.</li><li>I 'm surely glad i did n't get a ( L) arge bowl, like the waitress told me. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Did n't get to pick our own seats; lady quickly hollered for us to go where she pointed-_-- Waiter did not greet us after hollering at us where to sit!</li><li>I was n't planning on eating much, but the waitress was pretty persuasive.</li><li>The waitress recommended their chipotle ' firecracker' burger.</li><li>The waitress waited for us to download the scene app so we can get the points.</li><li>The waitress led us to our table and explained that they have an all you can eat menu and told us of their soft drink promotion.</li><li>The waitress left and we realized we were not served any tea.</li><li>It took a couple minutes before I successfully caught our waitress ' attention as she was too busy chatting with the sushi chefs and we promptly got the rest of our order.</li><li>The waitress returned with 3 scoops of ice cream in one bowl, and 2 scoops of ice cream in another bowl.</li><li>The waitress barely came to check up on us and I had to walk up to the counter FOUR times to get attended to.</li><li>Here 's the kicker, there were only 2 tables with customers ( including mine) in the restaurant and every time I approached the waitress she was texting on her iPhone.</li><li>PS- for the guys out there- extremely attractive waitress alert:).</li><li>We had to flag down another waitress to get the waitress serving our table.</li><li>We even had a different waitress bring our bill because the sorry-ass waitress that took our order did n't even bother to come back.</li><li>We even had a different waitress bring our bill because the sorry-ass waitress that took our order did n't even bother to come back.</li><li>Perhaps if we get a different waitress.</li><li>I did n't request for a new bowl, since I was already finished when I found the rice, but the waitress kept offering, which was nice.</li><li>We were handed the bill by the waitress but she never came back so my party of 12 all had to walk up to the front to pay.</li><li>Pretty typical Asian restaurant etiquette seems to be required here in order to get the waitress ' attention to ask for water.</li><li>The staff were fine- waitress was quick and polite.</li><li>The waitress initially said no soup or salad but brought it out after.</li><li>The waitress went to speak to the chef on staff, and came back to tell us that the chef said their fish is very fresh!</li><li>No one other than the waitress came to speak to us, and all the waitress kept saying is that their fish is always fresh.</li><li>So we finish our side dishes and when we asked to have them refilled, the waitress told us that the refill on kimchi would cost extra.</li><li>Another waitress came to refill ALL our side dishes and the other waitress was sent to other tables.</li><li>Another waitress came to refill ALL our side dishes and the other waitress was sent to other tables.</li><li>Pros: Has lunch specials and dinner specials, food came out quickly, tempura and japchae was yummy Cons: miso soup was too salty, the waitress sat me in a booth and did n't check up on me once the food came, did n't get a water refill, no banchan or kimchi, skimped on the Kalbi for the lunch special If you 're looking for a place in the area that serves Korean food for the same price, your best bet would be the Seoul house on Orfus Rd.
