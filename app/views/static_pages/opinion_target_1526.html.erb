<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1526' %><h2>BBQ ribs<br />occurrence: 3</h2><div><ol><li>Menu is tiny, only 9 food items, very limited # of drinks ... was looking for Korean BBQ ribs, none on the menu so I had the broiled BBQ beef which was good, served with a few side dishes, loved the dark little bean type item, not sure what it is though ???</li><li>We ordered deep fried dumplings, spicy fried squid, BBQ Ribs, and deep fried dumplings and waited no more than ten minutes.</li><li>This is not your usual BBQ ribs where the BBQ sauce is grilled on it so I was scared it was gonna be dry. but it actually amazed me !! even tho i ordered the sauce on the side I didnt need it cuz it was sooo flavourful and the meat was so tender it shocked me.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
