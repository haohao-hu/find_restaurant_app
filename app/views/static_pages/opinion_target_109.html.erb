<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 109' %><h2>spring rolls<br />occurrence: 61</h2><div><ol><li>We got some dim sum orders: shrimp roll, veggie dumpling, veggie spring rolls, chicken spring rolls, pork with black bean sauce, crispy chicken &amp; chicken Sho Mai along with some veggie fried rice.</li><li>Much better than the more expensive spring rolls across the street.</li><li>The spring rolls and egg rolls are both fine, but I find such items basically the same from one place to the next.</li><li>I had the spring rolls today; 4 huge rolls ( HUGE) for $ 6.</li><li>( In China, Pizza is served on fine china, in an upscale establishment, and enjoyed using a knife &amp; fork) The food is alright, just the spring rolls .. they are deplorable.</li><li>In conclusion, I 'm Chinese, if you 're charging me ten bucks for six spring rolls cut in half, they better come with room service, and promise to ' love me long time.'.</li><li>I 've had better, but it was okay ... the Tom Yong Goon soup ( I probably bastardized the spelling LOL) and it is pretty good ( I tend to get this soup when I go to a Spring Rolls) ... the actual Spring Rolls are my favorite and I order it usually as an appetizer ...</li><li>Spring Rolls is a chain, and everyone should know that when it comes to chains: 1.</li><li>Other Spring Rolls are better for sure but ok quality.</li><li>Firstly, the spring rolls are great- it 's in their name so it has to be good.</li><li>When six people go for lunch and all agree that the quality of the food has gone down hill to the point you would not go back if it were free, you know its bad. food okay but inconsistent in quality. sauces taste store bought. veggie spring rolls very bland.</li><li>Anyway, the prices were I guess average at $ 5 for 2 spring rolls and $ 8-10 for entrees.</li><li>I looooooove thai food ... not in spring rolls though ... it 's ok to come here for food on a lunch break maybe or while waiting for the movie at the cinema ... but not the ultimate food destination. what makes me put 2 starts is not even quality or authenticity of food but the smell of fried cheap oil that surrounds this restaurant whenever you pass it on the street ... there is also a hint of that smell inside in some parts of the restaurant ... other spring rolls locations would probably get a higher rating from me.</li><li>The person working never tried to up-sell me anything extra such as spring rolls or a side of chicken balls, but I 'm almost wishing she did just so I could pig out more and blame her.</li><li>It came with spring rolls, chicken and beef skewer along with some meat pieces.</li><li>I also liked their spring rolls.</li><li>Tasty spring rolls.</li><li>Chicken wings as well as spring rolls were on the greasy side, and the lemon grass chicken was also very fatty as if they were using the American variety, chickens from Ontario are never that fat.</li><li>Also, the spring rolls are not as crispy and savory as the Viet versions.</li><li>If u want good food get the spring rolls they r bonerific ...</li><li>A few of my favourites off the top of my head ...- avocado milkshake- pho with beef balls and rare beef- chicken pho- banh cuon- spring rolls ( or egg rolls, whatever you want to call it)- com tam This place is small for the amount of customers dining and waiting to get into the restaurant.</li><li>The spring rolls were crunchy and the durian shake was delicious.</li><li>My table of 3 ordered large bowls of Pho and possibly the tastiest spring rolls I have ever tasted.</li><li>They had chicken skewers, spring rolls, mini roast beef sandwiches, etc.</li><li>Apparently there was meat in the spring rolls.</li><li>For $ 50 including tax and a hefty tip, my boyfriend and I enjoyed on a Saturday night Sinagong ( tamarind) soup with prawns medium, Pancit Sampaguita medium, Lechon Kwahili medium ( fried pork), and Sampaguita dinner for two which included rice, lumpia ( spring rolls), deep fried chicken wings, and mixed grilled pork and chicken.</li><li>The spring rolls with shrimp and pork were ok.</li><li>Their spring rolls is so delicious.</li><li>Spring rolls are a must, done right the Vietnamese way.</li><li>The spring rolls were decent not too oily for deep fried food.</li><li>Food: For appetizers, my colleagues and I ordered the Spring Rolls.</li><li>I personally like the following dishes:- Spring rolls ( very very crispy_- fried butter chicken wings ( Juicy, and butterly tasty)- vietnam style pancake What 's else:- You ca n't really comment on the service, you know why,- I do n't like the fact that there are tables right besides the washroom ( this is just personal preference).</li><li>Has that authentic Vietnamese taste to their pho and their spring rolls.</li><li>Pho and Spring Rolls are generally the two things I try to tell if I like a Vietnamese restaurant and this place does both of them well.</li><li>It comes with a choice of spring rolls, and/or soup.</li><li>Love their soups and spring rolls!</li><li>The spring rolls were decent.</li><li>For 5 people we ordered: 2 Mango salads 2 Traditional platters ( 6 satays, 2 spring rolls each) Spring rolls Pad Thai Bangkok stir fry Chicken with thai basil Fried banana with honey Fried banana with ice cream Appetizers were n't anything spectacular, but enjoyable.</li><li>The service can go either way- we went here for my birthday and my brother double checked with the waiter that the spring rolls did n't contain any peanuts.</li><li>We ordered the spring rolls as an appetizer.</li><li>20 minutes after we ordered the server brought out two spring rolls cut in half that looked like they were just brought out of the deepfryer and previously frozen.</li><li>Not only did they NOT have Siam noodles, the service was snail paced slow, the waitress forgot our water and our spring rolls, the portions vs price were underwhelming and the experience was tasteless and expensive.</li><li>First of all, the spring rolls were absolutely appalling.</li><li>We end up going with a Pinot as they didnt have what we wanted, 10 minutes later, she comes over to take our food order .... starter ..... spring rolls .... easy enough right .... not for this server .... she forgets to put the order in and about 30 minutes later we have our main course ..... i order Chicken Panang ( $ 17 ..... way to expensive for what it was) and my wife some vegetable hot pot with tofu skin and mushroom in it ( $ 17 ... way to expensive for what it was) I spoke to the manager/ owner of this location.</li><li>NEVER AGAIN WILL I BE EATING AT LINDA 'S Grand total for a horrible night = $ 71.23 for two people two mains and a half liter of wine .... they comped the spring rolls .... nice enough but my tummy is still killing me ... that 's my 2 cents for ya .... follow it and you 'll save yourselves a DOLLAR.</li><li>To start, we shared an appetizer plate, which consisted of tender chicken lemongrass skewers with sweet peanut sauce, fresh shrimp, thinly sliced beef, and mediocre spring rolls.</li><li>Crispy beef curry ( golden curry of course), traditional appetizer platter ( chicken lemon grass sausage-varies- sometimes yummy sometimes really dry, beef satay, and spring rolls are all well made), coconut seafood curry-wow but little pricey, the chicken &amp; vegs rice- you might feel it too sour but I like it- not the chicken though; the steak dish--good, crispy duck leg- no, etc., fresh, nice presentation, and more of the restaurant quality than the Thai eateries we usually go for pad thai, flat rice noodles, one plate meals, which are, obviously not Linda 's specialities either.</li><li>The spring rolls we had to start were nice with a peanut sauce but nothing life changing.</li><li>I really liked their spring rolls and the vegetable fried rice.</li><li>It is cheaper than some big brands like spring rolls and yet it has good taste.</li><li>Spring rolls are pretty sizeble as well.</li><li>I like their plum sauce and egg rolls, not so crazy on the spring rolls.</li><li>Comes with miso soup, ice cream, tempura, spring rolls and a main dish.</li><li>They had the nerve to charge us the full all- you-can eat price for a freaking salad and 2 spring rolls !!</li><li>We ordered the spring rolls and they tasted exactly like a cheese pizza!</li><li>It 's amazing) and the spring rolls.</li><li>The spring rolls are also really good as well.</li><li>Our first order was a larger size &amp; the second order of the spring rolls were half the size.</li><li>For starters we had their Pearl appetizer: 3/5 consisted spring rolls, fried garlic shrimp dumplims, and shrimp rolls.</li><li>I love their `` Kyoto'' deal which comes with maki ( 3 california rolls, 3 cucumber rolls), chicken teriyaki, salad, rice, miso soup, 2 spring rolls, steamed vegetables, and desert.</li><li>The buffet had a number of standard items, such as spring rolls, hot and sour soup, General Tso chicken, and much more.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
