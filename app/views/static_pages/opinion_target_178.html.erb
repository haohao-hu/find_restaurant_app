<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 178' %><h2>MSG<br />occurrence: 36</h2><div><ol><li>Always good with special requests ( e.g. no MSG, little oil, no sugar, etc)- combo entrees come with a variety of drinks, their milk tea is my go-to- staff/owners are usually friendly ( the guy wo n't let you leave once you get him started).</li><li>I was under the impression that they has some kind of magical wings, sprinkled with psychedelics and MSG.</li><li>It was n't so flavourful, but that 's how it is supposed to taste if you do n't put MSG a lot ( I am not sure if they use any MSG in the soup).</li><li>Their tofu soups are a lot spicer than other places but it is also not full of MSG.</li><li>Again, it 's rare to find a pho place that does n't load their soup with MSG.</li><li>MSG was the only thing I tasted.</li><li>The small size was soooo big I almost could n't finish it, but then I am a twenty-something Asian, might have something to do with it: P I did n't want the rare beef so they gave me more brisket, the broth did have a hint of MSG, but show me a pho place that does n't nowadays!</li><li>Mmmmm, the salty taste of MSG.</li><li>The soup is always to full of flavour, a little less MSG would be better but then it would n't be pho joint.</li><li>I had the spicy chicken combo, she had the veggie combo, and neither of us were MSG laden afterwards, and their steamed veggies were the tops.</li><li>The Scarborough location of pho dau bo is a joke, the soup does n't taste half as good and is full of MSG.</li><li>I think this is the original location of the franchise because it 's run by Vietnamese ppl, always busy and the soup has little to NO MSG.</li><li>MSG: Yes they do add it, I would say average amount.</li><li>Once my MSG meter went up the cook confirmed my fears that they indeed do use MSG.</li><li>Too much MSG.</li><li>The plate portion was huge and no MSG.</li><li>The Lobster Bisque was very flavourful- a bit salty, but considering no MSG was used, the taste is really strong and wonderful.</li><li>And their dishes do n't use MSG ( not that I can tell at least).</li><li>Quick service, large portions, tasty dishes ( MSG) and cheap prices!</li><li>Pros:- lots of parking- big portions- deilicious food- good for big groups, spacious Cons:- ugly decor- must specify no MSG- distracted waitstaff- washrooms cold &amp; need updating but clean.</li><li>Apparently MSG is a secret weapon, and you have to specify they not use it if you do n't want it in your food ( that 's what it says on the takeout menu).</li><li>Little or no MSG in my opinion since I do n't get thirsty after drink the beef broth.</li><li>I 'm not sure if it 's MSG, but something also does n't taste very good in their rolls.</li><li>Does not appear to have MSG in the food which is always a good thing.</li><li>I personally did not taste much MSG in the food.</li><li>The broth, I could taste the MSG, so I did n't drink.</li><li>While it was recovering it gave that numbing sensation I usually get with MSG.</li><li>Chinese food is famous for using lots of MSG and often leaving you with a greasy after taste.</li><li>Overall, its a good place to go if you are under a budget! so sad! this place is close! i used to come here but recently i realize that it 's been replace by a korean restaurant. the wontons are so filled with shrimp, the fish balls had bones in them i always get scared the bones might choke me but the food tasted awesome! hot water dispenser is at each table so you make your own tea. the soups tasted too much of msg ... delicious but ... msg is bad for you. bye bye wonton place, i kinda miss you. small portions, but i love how u can put your own oyster sauce into your noodles, instead of asking like other regular wonton noodle places. also enjoyed having a hot water faucet at my table. clean and good atmosphere.</li><li>It 's so salty it makes you think it 's full of msg.</li><li>As I write this my head is still buzzing from the MSG.</li><li>Siu Mai was large but too salty and artificial msg.</li><li>You can ask for your food to be altered in a few ways such as; no peanut oil, not as spicy, no MSG and etc.</li><li>I 've read reviews of people suggesting that they use msg.</li><li>This can only mean one thing- excessive amounts of MSG!</li><li>I 'd feel so disrespected if I 'd created ramen and the alternative was a 99 cent package of MSG.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
