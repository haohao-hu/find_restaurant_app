<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 85' %><h2>appetizers<br />occurrence: 70</h2><div><ol><li>They started off by serving us complimentary tea and appetizers ( including miso soup).</li><li>I also love the appetizers they give.</li><li>It even bigger than before! its very impressive probably 200 items + and they had a good selection of not only desserts but set meals ( ie clay pot rices, and appetizers, and soups) The desserts are even better now, some are new like ice chow mein.</li><li>I had a selection of appetizers, sushi, sashimi and a spider roll.</li><li>Great appetizers and beautiful salads.</li><li>Overall, just a crappy experience. been here only few times and always for lunch. lunch options are very good and at least vegetarian options are pretty cheap ( tofu bento box + soup + salad = $ 7). the food is yummy! and they have some interesting appetizers like avocado tempura! which is just delicious! the staff is friendly and helpful.</li><li>The appetizers are a little higher priced for the food, and we split the Thai Chicken Bites.</li><li>The food is delicious and it 's so conveniently located too:) Whenever we ask for seconds on the appetizers they 're happy to provide:) great customer service.</li><li>Good appetizers, the cucumber was my favorite.</li><li>They are definitely one of the best appetizers ( the other contender being the Calamari).</li><li>I strongly recommend their appetizers especially the chicken skewers &amp; spring rolls.</li><li>We started out with a few appetizers: calamari was golden and crispy.</li><li>I 've eaten here multiple times having either the pizzas, appetizers, salads, lunch sandwiches or entrees and they are all absolutely delicious!</li><li>The appetizers were the typical Korean appetizers, yet, they did n't provide kimchi for us -- we had to ask them for it.</li><li>Spring rolls and the rice sticky buns with shrimps are great appetizers.</li><li>They give us the right herbs for our pho ( which others rarely do), the rice combos are extensive and their appetizers are all delicious.</li><li>They have a variety of other AYCE Sushi staples like Tempura items, Ramen and Noodle Soups, Salads, Rice dishes, and appetizers like Beef Enoki, Korean Short Ribs, Skewers, and cutlets.</li><li>Food: For appetizers, my colleagues and I ordered the Spring Rolls.</li><li>The toasted garlic bread and taramusilato was good, and the appetizers were passable.</li><li>My side plate from our appetizers was sitting in front of me and the waiter made no move to move my plate for my entree.</li><li>They have an extensive menu consisting of pizza 's, pastas, sandwiches, salads and appetizers.</li><li>The tofu dish among the little appetizers was the freshest I 've ever had at a restaurant.</li><li>Their appetizers are worth mentioning: delicious, some of the best kimchi I 've ever had in the city!</li><li>We had heard such great thing but was extremely disappointed. the appetizers were okay, but one of the parties ordered the soup and it was smaller than a tea cup.</li><li>They have share-able appetizers that are betel leaves that you turn into some taco-thing that are unique and delicious.</li><li>Some appetizers were very delicious but very pricey and each dish was n't enough to share with 3 others.</li><li>Cons:- Bad service- Small quantity- Pho was sub-par- Appetizers were overpriced for the amount I would say it was the first, and last time I will be at this restaurant.</li><li>It 's not the traditional `` thick'' tahina you may get some places ( it 's more of a watered-down liquid, in a squeeze bottle) but it 's still very tasty and in unlimited supply -- a group of 6 of us go through SEVERAL bottles of it when we 're there, putting it on everything -- the appetizers, the meat, the rice, everything.</li><li>As usual, the appetizers did not come until nearly 20 minutes later.</li><li>They got their drinks and appetizers so quick and we waited there for 30 mins and nothing came to us.</li><li>Why could n't the waiter just serve both our tables the appetizers ?!</li><li>So after a long time of waiting I went up to a server to ask for our appetizers ( I love their potatoes and that 's all I really wanted).</li><li>We did n't get our appetizers until we asked them ( 30 minutes after we ordered) and it took about 40 minutes for us to get our food ... the place was n't even packed!</li><li>I love their appetizers ... so yummy.</li><li>At this point, we questioned the server why we were still missing 2 appetizers when this other table received both of theirs.</li><li>Time your cooking so that all 3 appetizers are ready at the same time.</li><li>Soups and appetizers are all around $ 5 and mains are in and around the $ 10- $ 15 range.</li><li>Their service is good and you always get many free yummy appetizers!</li><li>They have great appetizers and fried chicken.</li><li>As for the appetizers, the lettuce salad was average, but I enjoyed the coleslaw and the cubes of pickled something ( not sure what it was).</li><li>I always fill up on the appetizers, which include caviar, smoked salmon, shrimp cocktail, crab salad, ceasar salad, and on and on.</li><li>The food was good but I 'd agree that the appetizers were better than the mains, although I did n't eat many mains because I was full of the early dishes.</li><li>This restaurant offers a large menu with tons of sushi, great appetizers and various bento box options.</li><li>The price point is amazing for super yummy soups and great free appetizers!</li><li>Like many Korean restaurants, it came with unlimited amount of appetizers ( bean sprouts, kimchi, radish etc.).</li><li>The server hands you a few order sheets, and you mark down the quantity of each item desired, whether it 's sushi, appetizers, soups, noodles, hot dishes, etc., and they make everything to order.</li><li>This was nice as it let me try a variety of different dishes and appetizers.</li><li>We always order wings, calamari, beer, appetizers and deserts.</li><li>We were pleasant, waited patiently for everything, even ate our order of wings anticipating that our appetizers were going to be coming soon!</li><li>Long list of unique hot and cold drinks, deserts and appetizers.</li><li>I was out with the girls for a late night chirp-fest, and thus iced coffees and appetizers were on our agenda.</li><li>Those `` safe'' items + the appetizers are a great introduction.</li><li>The appetizers are a good selection and it is really nice of them to give us refills.</li><li>My favorite part about this place is the appetizers.</li><li>Pros: bottomless appetizers, gyoza ( TO DIE FOR), fast service ( although not the friendliest), bibimbap!</li><li>The service and appetizers are the redeeming factor.</li><li>Sure, the restaurant was clean and shiny, the appetizers ( fried eggplant in tomato sauce and baba ghanoush) were excellent as always, and the pita bread baked on site was nearly perfect.</li><li>The dips, bread, and appetizers here are jaw dropping: kashkeh bademjan, bademjan kebob, maust borani ..</li><li>No one wanted the cake since we were already full from the free appetizers and entrees.</li><li>Wait, there 's more, they charged us for the appetizers, I inquired and he said `` the bread was complimentary, not the appetizers''.</li><li>We had ordered- 4 skewers that our waiter suggested, the taadig appetizer, 2 vegeterian appetizers ( olives, and a yogurt blend- both terrific!), 2 glasses of house wine and a beer.</li><li>A number of snacks and appetizers are also available, and they have cups of ( what I assume is) fresh soy milk available for purchase.</li><li>The selection of appetizers was just enough to let everyone at the table have a small main course.</li><li>Let 's start with the appetizers,- Gyoza dumplings, shrimp tempura is pretty good nothing special.</li><li>Our four course meal consisted of cold and warm appetizers, followed by a fish and meat course.</li><li>$ 19.95 for a half lobster, appetizers and a main with salad, soup etc.</li><li>We made 2 orders of the medium rare bone-in prime rib ( $ 42.95) and some soups and appetizers to share amongst 5 adults.</li><li>Our appetizers were escargots and Caesar salad.</li><li>The appetizers are done well, and they 're honestly mainly meant as something to sustain your stomach as you chat a bit and decide on your food choices.</li><li>Find something else. went there with a friend for lunch, it was buffet. the place was quite small but with a lot of places to sit! they have large tables too! the service was great, fast and friendly people. the buffet include: one soup 2 or 3 salad options many dips and sauces 1 rice 3-4 kind of vegetable dishes 5-6 meat dishes ( include chicken, lamb, beef, shrimps) they also have bread ( nan) and appetizers ( could not remember the names) they also have desserts ( 2 kinds) and fruits the taste was very good and not too spicy, however they have really extreme spicy sauces! the price was around 10 dollars as a neighborhood restaurant it one of the best options in the area and for sure I 'll be back:).</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
