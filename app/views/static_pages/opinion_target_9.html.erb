<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 9' %><h2>server<br />occurrence: 605</h2><div><ol><li>The food does come quickly, but expect the server to disappear after you 've been brought your food, and possibly not visit for the duration of the meal.</li><li>We were the only people there except for another group, and there was only one female server ( who much preferred to text on her phone most of the time).</li><li>I have been at this place for past few days and simply its the worst experience. the first day I got my gyro order on toasted white bread with no sauce or any other form of toppings !! when I complained to server and ask if I coukd see the manager `` I was told that there is no manager at this place and the owner is running the place'' AND OF COURSE THE OWNER WAS NOT AROUND. on second visit I ordered the bruschetta dish, no basil or olive oil was used !!!!</li><li>The server gets 4 stars for being patient and upbeat but did n't know what anything on the menu was.</li><li>It 's already a bad sign when each person has to explain to the server what is stated on the menu- grab a pen and paper and write it down at least!</li><li>Just so you know, the little button on the wall is to call the server.</li><li>Go figure, I 've been to better quality and service eateries that cost less, but I digress. the server then rudely snatches the takeout menu from my hand and stacks it back with the rest.</li><li>I never specified and the server never asked so I guess they felt like a sago night.</li><li>They passed the buffet and he asked either the manager or a server if he could take a piece of banana bread to settle her.</li><li>The price is decent and the server was patient and friendly.</li><li>The server could of checked in on me to see if everything was good or if I needed anymore tea, however it was relatively busy for a single server.</li><li>The server could of checked in on me to see if everything was good or if I needed anymore tea, however it was relatively busy for a single server.</li><li>The server was nice and our food came with warm pita bread, pickles, onions and peppers, which I enjoyed.</li><li>The service was fast and the server were quick on moving the line.</li><li>One thing they should improve upon is their server team, but it 's understandable considering they just opened.</li><li>There was one server who was nice though.</li><li>Upon consuming the one pitcher of beer and devouring the 2lbs of wings and fries, we were approached by a server in regards to the bill, and we mutually relayed the notion of splitting the bill- the price of the pitcher would be covered by my colleague, and I would pay for the 2lbs of wings + fries.</li><li>Prior to reaching the exit, the server with attitude who was stationed at the bar yelled `` thanks a lot guys, good job you f****** cheap as* es''.</li><li>The last words uttered by this server were not taken kindly by myself and my colleague and for some reason or another, we perceived the foundation of our treatment laden with racial undertones ( myself being an East Indian Male ( brown skinned), and my colleague- a visibly Jewish Male ( Star of David pendant exposed)- both somehow playing the inadvertent and stereotypical cliche roles of the `` Cheap Brown Guy/Cheap Jewish Guy''.</li><li>Pros: friendly environment Nice server Reasonable price Cons: Bad food quality Everything was good but the food!</li><li>However, the most ingenious idea South Street does is server you New York Fries my favorite type of fries!</li><li>I usually get uni, but once the shipment was from a warmer season and the server said its still good but not as good as it could be!)</li><li>The server was very friendly too.</li><li>The fish was absolutely perfect -- it tasted like it may have been swimming several hours back:) The service was excellent- the server volunteered to change the existing roll components to what he inferred we would like- which is unusual to say the least.</li><li>If it did n't take a while for a server to take our order, I would give this place 5 stars!</li><li>Our server was very kind and attentive.</li><li>Servers were quick, courteous and knowledgeable ... and initially when my server thought I has n't had sushi before, her approach to explaining the difference between a maki/ hand roll &amp; sashimi did n't make me feel like an idiot.</li><li>I appreciate places where I do n't have to constantly call the server to refill my glass of water, but have it filled up for me without even asking.</li><li>We had a delicious meal here- unfortunately the server was n't very quick to greet us and our food sat on top of the sushi bar waiting to come to us for a long long time.</li><li>Once you are seated, the server arrives immediately to take your drink order.</li><li>Does n't take long to get a table and our server returns often asking if we 're ok, or to refill drinks, bring napkins etc.</li><li>Our server was excellent.</li><li>More than one server catered to us and the attitude was more than pleasant.</li><li>The server was very friendly and gave great suggestions.</li><li>When I was ordering, the server was able to tell that I was just guessing and she started asking me questions on what I liked and then made a different recommendation.</li><li>Our server was fantastic, very engaged with us ladies and not in an arrogant `hitting on us`kinda way.</li><li>I sat at the sushi bar, since I was alone, and it took forever ( at least 15 minutes) to even be greeted by a server, despite the fact that I was literally sitting right next to where they grabbed the sushi from to take to other tables.</li><li>Once I did get greeted, and I ordered and the food came out pretty promptly, but near the end of my meal, I wanted to order another drink but again, it was at least 10 minutes before the server came back ( and at that point, a gentlemen they 'd seated next to me had been waiting that same 10 minutes to be greeted by a server) so I gave up and asked for the bill.</li><li>Once I did get greeted, and I ordered and the food came out pretty promptly, but near the end of my meal, I wanted to order another drink but again, it was at least 10 minutes before the server came back ( and at that point, a gentlemen they 'd seated next to me had been waiting that same 10 minutes to be greeted by a server) so I gave up and asked for the bill.</li><li>On one recent trip the chef came around the bar to correct the plate position in front of me; apparently the server had put it the wrong way around.</li><li>The server forgot to bring my soya bowl.</li><li>It was just my coworker and I. We asked for popular items that we could order and the server was awesome with describing everything and very honest with his recommendation.</li><li>We did tell our server and got a visit from the manager, He was rude and did not look very anderstanding.</li><li>The sauce was a perfect complement to the bread, and the mussels were very fresh as promised by our server.</li><li>Very good food, you cannot miss this if you simply want good food in nice environment. cozy little family house style, very friendly owner and server.</li><li>Our server, who said she was a manager, was perfect: friendly, efficient, and she made great suggestions.</li><li>I came on a quite busy weeknight and was taken to my unset table where my server would not approach us until after 10 minutes of aggressive/awkward eye contact.</li><li>The hostess and server and even the bus boy was quick and ready to go.</li><li>I asked the server ( who was n't very friendly) whats on the pizza.</li><li>The server was also rude and kept forgetting about our order.</li><li>Wow talk about customer server at its worst.</li><li>Thankfully a server warmed it for us so we could enjoy it.</li><li>I would n't mind coming back if I feel like Boston Pizza again. we were just here couple of minutes ago, ordered artichoke dip, wings and steak. everything is edible and taste good except for the steak, i told the server that the steak is chewy and she said it suppose to be ok especially its medium rare, and she said that she cant do anything about it .. the steak os chewy, to the point that its not edible! the server is very nice but in situation like that she does n't know how to handle it!</li><li>Our server was lovely.</li><li>I laughed but our server was totally cool with it although she did kinda give my friend a funky look haha.</li><li>The server told me they kept the soup bland on purpose so that you can add salt on your own according to your preference.</li><li>But beware of the owners/servers although we had no problem with the server.</li><li>Very polite and knows everything on menu, the server.</li><li>The server did n't take my order so I had to ask him to come back and then when the food came out we were missing a place and it took a while for the last plate to come out ( which I assume our server missed the order) But overall the food was yummy!</li><li>The server did n't take my order so I had to ask him to come back and then when the food came out we were missing a place and it took a while for the last plate to come out ( which I assume our server missed the order) But overall the food was yummy!</li><li>Service 3/5 ( 10% of final grade) The server was cold at the beginning of the meal, but began to warm up at the end of it.</li><li>As if I was in this situation as the server, I would wish to have a second chance and learn from my mistakes, and grow as a person.</li><li>Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu.</li><li>So we get to our seat and thankfully our server was friendlier.</li><li>I wish our server had pointed that out instead of just telling us that the checkout would deal with the coupon.</li><li>So upon getting our tab from another server ( our server disappeared), we showed the Yelp deal for a free cocktail.</li><li>We ordered and two of the three entrees we ordered were incorrect but the server discounted both by 50% each.</li><li>The only good thing about the place was extremely efficient Asian server.</li><li>Firstly, if I were to review just the service of this place, I would give it 5 stars, as we were 10 people today and our server handled us amazingly.</li><li>Inconsistent quality depending on the server, sometimes amazing, most of the time average.</li><li>The server named Mark ( Marc ?) is cute and awesome, give him a wink from me!</li><li>The server first said that we werent allowed to bring a bottle of wine.</li><li>Had to speak to the manager and they did allow it but the server wasnt aware.</li><li>So nice and so helpful and just a tad shy- everything you want in a server.</li><li>Service was not good at all, server seemed bored and uninterested in being here.</li><li>The food arrived later than the estimated delivery time, and when I answered the door the delivery guy just said the name of the restaurant, handed me the bag, and walked away ( I get that it 's possible that the delivery person did n't speak much English, but as a server myself I expect at least a `` hello'').</li><li>The server did not ask us for our order neither did he come to give our checks.</li><li>And as if that was not bad service enough, the server fought with us for not tipping.</li><li>The server had come up to us to give us menus, and generally the service was the highlight of the place. the waitress was polite, and explained every question with patience. the part that failed them was the wait time for the food. some of their special items had run out, but at 10pm or so, right before long weekend that is to be expected.</li><li>Thankfully, the server was very understanding and kind enough to change my order.</li><li>However, the button does not remain for long ... once you 've placed your order the button is out of reach ...): Well, at least it makes ordering a lot easier than waving frantically at a server to get their attention!</li><li>Went here on Thursday night for wings ... got there at 1:00 am ordered the wings and happened to find one that was littered with hair, not talking about 1 or 2 hairs ... but several hairs ( I wish I took a picture) ... the server tried to tell me that it was not hair but left over cartilage that they missed when cleaning the chicken ( I did n't know cartilage looked like hair) ... the shocking part to me was that she acted as if everything was cool and that I should just put it aside, only after I made enough noise, they finally decided that they would take 1 of the 2 pounds that I ordered off if the bill ... if you ask me ... my whole meal should have been free .... seems like they need to learn a thing or two about customer service.</li><li>My only word of advice to anyone that orders wings from here is to make sure you inspect your food carefully as apparently `` hairy looking cartilage'' on your wings is a regular thing and not a big deal based on the reaction from the server when I brought it up and their lack of willingness to do anything about it.</li><li>Most disgusting food I 've eaten in my life, not to mention server ignored our table all night.</li><li>The server was a bit slow, but she was genuinely friendly!</li><li>All staff make you feel right at home, my favourite server is Holly, she is so sweet and makes you feel very welcome.</li><li>Service-wise, the server we had originally take our orders left sometime after serving our meals.</li><li>It took quite a while to get another server to attend to us and finally get us our bill.</li><li>The server handed us the order sheet, we filled it and she collected it.</li><li>The server was quick to provide us with containers to take the leftovers home.</li><li>The server seemed like she was the owner, when I ordered toast and asked her to take the plate she looked at me and commented I maybe was n't as hungry as I thought, gee I guess it never occured to her it was crap, and she wanted to be paid in full with taking it off the bill. paid my bill in full and left.</li><li>Pat ( server) has been with the restaurant for over 30 years- from when Peter 's dad and uncle owned the place.</li><li>The server was so nice and the food was great!</li><li>So we proceeded to walk in on our own then we saw a server peer from behind the counters.</li><li>Then the server disappeared again ...</li><li>Our server was very attentive, always checking on us.</li><li>Our server had a difficult time suggesting a wine to accompany our meal but that 's alright, we do n't know good wine anyways.</li><li>The server broke the cork, did not apologize, and just went to get another server.</li><li>The server broke the cork, did not apologize, and just went to get another server.</li><li>We were lucky to have an awesome server who cracked jokes the whole time- I wish I remembered his name ..</li><li>Our amazing server immediately took my plate back to the kitchen and came back with additional side salad so I got to eat something at least.</li><li>Our apologetic server gave us two complimentary desserts to make up for the overcooked steak.</li><li>Our server Howie was exceptional!</li><li>To call our server lifeless, is being kind.</li><li>Although the server did n't tell us that the soup was spicy, it was so heavy on chili that his mouth was burning.</li><li>The server had told us in advance that the beef is served medium rare, which was fine, because we usually order meat rare to medium rare.</li><li>Again, no one checked with us to see if things were okay, so my husband went to find the server.</li><li>The server seemed genuinely concerned with our satisfaction.</li><li>We alerted our server that the meat was tough and terrible, and he immediately took it off the bill.</li><li>Our server was the most entertaining and nicest person.</li><li>Our server that night did n't seem too interested in making any changes after my friend and I mentioned the `` lasagna soup,'' so now I wonder which version of the lasagna was the fluke.</li><li>The person at the door and our server were extremely friendly.</li><li>Our server was very quick in providing drinks ... so the service was decent.</li><li>I asked the server why there was no basil on the Margarita pizza and he said it was already in the sauce.</li><li>It took a little over 5 minutes before we were greeted by our server who did n't give her name.</li><li>Her entree came with 2 of the 3 sides missing and when we pointed that out to our server she notified the kitchen and it was brought out a few minutes later, while good, an apology would have mended fences better.</li><li>When we finished and the bus boy ( who gave the best service of the night) cleared our table we sat there for several minutes before our server came to take my cup for a refill ( which I declined).</li><li>The only thing that saved the morning was the outdoor patio which was pretty nice, except it was a scorcher and the server did n't feel like challenging himself to open the umbrella.</li><li>Very cute, and it was even cuter getting greeted immediately from a server dressed in a kimono.</li><li>After we ordered the dinner, the server told us there 's a Sunday special- if our order is over $ 30, we will have a free appetizer.</li><li>The only down side is, I did go when there was only one server and the service was really slow.</li><li>The server was helpful in accommodating dietary restrictions of others at my table, but sometimes became a bit busy with her other customers, leaving us to ask another server at the restaurant for occasional assistance.</li><li>The server was helpful in accommodating dietary restrictions of others at my table, but sometimes became a bit busy with her other customers, leaving us to ask another server at the restaurant for occasional assistance.</li><li>The second time I came my server was this sweet younger lady who was patient enough to explain to me the various dishes and the ingredients.</li><li>Our server was very friendly and attentive.</li><li>We were placed in a corner and the server took forever to get to us.</li><li>Clearly their specialty is in take-out, the server is rarely in sight ( in a small store) and did n't remember customizations ( eg. we were asked if we wanted all potatoes, or half rice/half potatoes, and everyone got half/half).</li><li>The comical and charming Russian server with the ' good hair day' everyday adds color to this humble establishment which is family owned and OWN shawarma making like a BOSS !!!</li><li>At no fault of the one server working the entire restaurant the service was not good.</li><li>But the server said there would be another 5 minute wait time because they have to clean one for us.</li><li>The dip was too spicy for my fiancee so she asked our server if they had any other options for dipping sauce and he said no they did n't.</li><li>But the veggie sticks were just out of the fridge ( or freezer, since our plates have been sitting on a counter in their kitchen for so long) The server, Rafael, was nice and apologized to us for being late with our food.</li><li>The server we had was great, friendly, funny and efficient.</li><li>Our server was very nice, and was eager to check on us which was great, but her shift ended at 130 so she brought the bill over and explained that hr shift was coming to an end but that we were more than welcome to stay.</li><li>Our server was very polite, but did not offer the usual introductions you get at other steak houses.</li><li>The server even offered us free drinks because he felt that he did n't check up on us enough.</li><li>Only 10% for a bad server.</li><li>Had the following Calamari- Not too greasy, could be a bit crispier but thoroughly enjoyed it with the Cajun dip Tortilla and Dip- Tasty and refills of tortillas was offered by our server Ribs with Fries n Beans- Ribs were prepared quite good, fall off the bone, not too fatty, not too much muscle fibers, sauce was good, fries were crispy, bans were not mush, definitely recommended NY and Top Sirloin Steak was cooked proper to medium rare, for the price it had a decent depth of flavor, salad that came with it was pretty standard, veggies were cooked well, mashed potatoes was good, first time having the Peppercorn sauce not taste like burnt chocolate, bravo to the new kitchen staff Probably will come back but I 'll probably request Miranda as my server as there 's been too many servers that take their job for granted at this location.*** note they do n't validate parking anymore 2apps 3 entrees Above average gratuity Around $ 150 for 3 happy and full people Will come back to this location if I 'm having a craving for tender ribs.</li><li>Our server Darwin was horrible, he took forever to come to our table to get our orders then once he arrived he took my husband and I drink order and then walked away without getting my in laws order.</li><li>Our server rushed us through our order, brought our food and she was no where to be seen until we finished our meal.</li><li>I noticed that other customers kept getting up to get the server and ask for anything they needed.</li><li>After 15 mins of waiting, I got up and went get the server myself.</li><li>Got the butter chicken and Lamb Rogan Josh which our server recommended to us.</li><li>Our server was extremely nice and chatted with us and even packed our ( lots) of leftovers for us at the table.</li><li>Good flavours although today the server dropped potato pieces on the counter while serving and he picked it up and still served it.</li><li>Not addressing the server 's bare-hand handling of cash and food was particularly classy. popped in here for a NY Style deli sandwich and recommendations on Yelp. as soon as you walk in you can tell it 's a wonderful family business.</li><li>When I asked the server if it was tuna she did n't know ...</li><li>Most of the service was quite good, save for one small mishap where the server thought I was done with my meal ( even though I had two pieces of tempura left in my bento) and tried to take away my sauce.</li><li>I was able to devour my courses hurriedly with the aid of my most helpful server, but would highly suggest that you visit Samjung Sushi for a nice intimate dinner instead.</li><li>First of all the fish/sushi was not fresh fish at all seems as though the server quickly brought it to us so I 'm assuming it was prepared hours ago or maybe even day ( s) old as in the sushi was sitting around for a while ...</li><li>Also, there was korean food on the menu too with all korean people working there but the server was very pushy in the way she acted like we asked for a couple minutes with the menu and she would push her way to get us to order when we literally had no time with the menu ..</li><li>Our server was so nice, she listened to us very well for what we want.</li><li>The server failed to bring bread to the table and the portions were much smaller than the other locations.</li><li>Impossible to find a server, everyone running around in a frenzy doing their best to avoid eye contact.</li><li>I asked the server and told me it 's coming soon twice.</li><li>My girlfriend and I wanted to eat Middle Eastern food so we found this place. we waited to be seated, a server brought us to a table as we were sitting down he quickly mentioned something pointing out a direction.</li><li>My girlfriend said, I think he said `` when you 're ready to order it would be over there'' I asked another server we 're ready to order, she said the same thing I could n't believe it. it 's a restaurant not a fast-food restaurant. we were given a menu, they brought bread but yet I had to walk to a small corner with the menu where there was one guy taking everyone 's orders. waited about 7 minutes to order.</li><li>The food is brought to the table by a server.</li><li>We ordered some bbq chicken and a beef pepperoni pizza, it was weird that we had to pay first, so one is forced to tip ahead of getting a good service- which leads me the part where I explain that there was barely any greeting from the server and no indication that I had remember my table number before making the order on the other side of the restaurant.</li><li>I had ordered a tabbouleh salad with a side of chicken skewers and when the server brought our food I was served a fattoush salad with the chicken so I told her that it was n't what I had ordered and she brought it back to her manager who seemed confused then a few minutes later she came back with my food.</li><li>The woman who was the server came to our table to ask if everything was okay and we both kinda hesitated to answer her because everything really was n't okay at all.</li><li>When we had finished our sub par meals my friend then had to go find the manager in order to get a refund on the hummus we were charged for that we did n't even want and he was n't even the person that refunded the money it was the girl who was the server.</li><li>I also forgot to mention that while serving me the wrong salad that the server dropped garlic sauce into my lap and on my clothes.</li><li>And why ca n't they stick to one server per table so that you can build a relationship with that one person and not have 4 or 5 different people come and ask you if you need anything and what not.</li><li>Service- 4 stars The server was very nice and curteous.</li><li>The open fire oven lends a really authentic air but the server was really rude.</li><li>I asked the server if someone had not shown up, and she replied NO she 's on lunch.</li><li>I asked the server and was told the original owners had sold.</li><li>Once our pasta dishes arrived the server said she would be back with fresh cheese .... we never saw her again, until we flagged her down to pay.</li><li>I believe our server was one of the owners because as she rudely told us `` I can make what ever policies I want'' after we questioned the $ 20 minimum.</li><li>Service was fine in my books, my only interaction with our server was to order and to ask for the bill.</li><li>The server proceeded with taking our orders but he did n't seem to be very fluent in English.</li><li>Food was good but the server was rude and made me never want to go back !!!</li><li>When I presented our server with our Travel Zoo voucher, she seemed disgruntled.</li><li>And this same server would have me repeating my order at least 2 times and then repeating a totally different menu item back to me.</li><li>We waited, and waited and then waited some more to try to flag down a server.</li><li>First, we have dairy &amp; egg allergies in the group, so we obviously made note of it to our server.</li><li>These were exact words from our server, a old Caucasian male.</li><li>Our server was very attentive and kind.</li><li>The server noticed I had cleaned out my plate and was very happy to let his chef know.</li><li>BUT wait I waited for a while before any server decided to come take my order.</li><li>He finally hit his bell and the server turned around and he pointed to me and said something to the lady.</li><li>The server was bringing out phos with her finger in soup. ugghh I am not a big fan of Pho but I go here with family because they love this place.</li><li>But one female server denied to check it so I had to go with my credit card bill ..</li><li>After, we told our server and she allowed us to order something else.</li><li>Our server never came back to check up on our meal after her error.</li><li>Prepare to take forever to get a hold of the server.</li><li>This place uses the iPad to order food so no time wasted on waiting for a server to take your order.</li><li>It was n't until near the end, when we had to tell a different server that our roll did n't come, did it finally come after he manually input it into the computer.</li><li>We told the server she kindly apologize and someone else came and apologized.</li><li>After we handed in the ordering paper we waited 15mins to get the basic soup and seaweed salad, and that was after I complained to the server.</li><li>After we finally were seated, the server gave us all-you-can-eat menu, and it could have been a difficult task to understand how it works, if it was n't for our friend who knows the system haha.</li><li>Anyways, the server seemed to jave lost our order, so we waited and waited and waited, for at least 30 minutes for her to bring us beers.</li><li>Even after we called the server and reminded her that we 're still waiting for our food several ( !!!) times, it was n't getting any better!</li><li>Situation changed only when we asked for another server, who at least could speak some English.</li><li>But the server had our menu, tea, and utensils as soon as we sat down.</li><li>It has a narrow dining area where you can sit down and the server will bring the menus.</li><li>The rolls were rather large but the server brought us as scissor to cut in half.</li><li>The lady server was charming in her own way.</li><li>The server was super courteous and the pizza was great.</li><li>I had to wait to place my order since the server went on break.</li><li>I wanted to give this place a one star since I the fly landing on each topping was unsanitary and the long break the server took was n't very client friendly.</li><li>The server told us to seat ourselves which we went outside and sat in the corner.</li><li>They forgot to bring our appetizers and only when we reminded the server did the food come.</li><li>There was only one server on a Saturday night but somehow he managed well enough, though it was occasionally a bit difficult to get a hold of him.</li><li>Complimentary nachos were a nice addition and the server was also friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.</li><li>Our server was friendly, professional, and prompt.</li><li>Great server.</li><li>Since the server seemed reluctant to make any adjustments on the bill, my cousin drank my drink just before we left, and apparently it was not a good Long Island anyway.</li><li>( I should have known when the server said she was a bartender, and mentioned iced tea in a long island!- for non-long island drinkers, there should not be an ounce of tea in there.</li><li>We had to wait quite a while for a server ( any server, not even ours) to come close enough to ask for ketchup.</li><li>We had to wait quite a while for a server ( any server, not even ours) to come close enough to ask for ketchup.</li><li>Our server, Rachel, was really friendly.</li><li>The server said that I would have to use the ATM.</li><li>The service is OK when the restaurant is slow, but when busy takes quite awhile to get a server to come to the table and for food to arrive.</li><li>We had a very friendly server.</li><li>Our server brought green tea without us having to ask, and right after we ordered, brought complimentary appetizers -- cold tofu in a spicy vinegar-y sauce and cold edamame ( like Lesley C., I also prefer edamame served hot and salted.</li><li>Our server was very friendly however, and momentarily that lifted my not-so-great experience.</li><li>Careless lady server did not add points to my card, and lied to me that the points have been added.</li><li>The place is like a family restaurant so it was a little slow at first but the server is super nice and knows the authentic Thai cuisine well.</li><li>The server is actually super nice as well!</li><li>I asked the server something about the soup and decided the stay in.</li><li>I was told that they will not serve me unless I ordering a main course, `` Soup is not enough'' the server added ..</li><li>The server insist we moved to the table behind us because it 's cleaner and they were closing in half an hour.</li><li>My date really wanted to sit with the window view, so we asked the server to clean the table.</li><li>Our server kicked us out saying we 're closed.</li><li>Also, my server did not give me a receipt so I did not know which # I was, it usually would n't be a problem but when the store is full as fuck, it gets hard to get your drink.</li><li>We started off with the Soup of the Day ( $ 5)- I forget what the soup was called ( the soup of the day is n't written on the menu but the server will tell you about it) but it was a sort of creamy corn soup.</li><li>Our server was very attentive, and the food was delicious.</li><li>Maybe it was an off night for our server.</li><li>We asked several times, until we finally asked another server, who was very pleasant and obliging!</li><li>Our server was fast and friendly.</li><li>- Server was nice and knew his stuff, but having to look for him just to get the bill was kind of ... annoying.</li><li>Like to watch the football sat mornings Got there a little before opening and was let in and served coffee while I watched a match Ordered a plate of wings and had a Guinness for lunch ( they pour a great Guinness) like my wings hot and these Had good heat but had great flavour, not burn your head off Sauce The server an older lady they called `` Dee'' was a seasoned vet Treated everyone there like family In fact the group of folks there were very Friendly and though I do n't live too close, I will make the trek to catch a match When I can!</li><li>Our super awesome server, Bonnie, admitted it was her favourite, so I was excited to give it a shot.</li><li>As I mentioned, we had a super awesome server, Bonnie, AND it was fight night.</li><li>We sat in a spacious wooden booth complete with a doorbell to call the server ( I hear this is standard in Korea).</li><li>We had a group of 6 and ordered a set meal that came with noodles ( and some veggies) in soup, seafood pancake, Tangsuyuk ( Sweet, sour, and crispy pork), bulgogi in a pot where the server cooked for us, and pork bone soup, and of course several side dishes.</li><li>Our server did not greet us.</li><li>THIS was the exact scenario at mezza notte trattoria. plain, boring, bland pasta. bleh. it didnt help that the server was pretty snotty &amp; stuck up, looking so displeased and forced serving us. the pasta dish i ordered was also recommended by this server as well. i dont think i 'll ever come back.</li><li>THIS was the exact scenario at mezza

recommended by this server as well. i dont think i 'll ever come back.</li><li>Or server was AWESOME !!! she did a great job with such a large group.</li><li>Crispy Duck Leg with Steamed Dumplings- `` steamed dumplings'' is a real misnomer; they are actually a won ton wrapper or a `` duck pastry'' as sold in Chinese supermarkets ( 10/ $ 1.99); our server called them `` pancakes''.</li><li>The batter is nice and crispy, and our server deboned the legs at the table and shredded the duck into bite size pieces suitable for the wrappers.</li><li>The restaurant had a nice ambience and our server was pleasent.</li><li>The server asked us if we were going to order lunch potion or meal potion because the meal potion are bigger.</li><li>Our server was polite and helpful, although towards the end of our meal, her service levels fell ( empty water glasses, long wait for dessert menu and orders).</li><li>We did not leave the typical 15% tip since it was n't earned- we found that we felt rushed, the server was not attentive, and the deep fried banana batter was undercooked.</li><li>I was going to give her the extra money since it was very awkward and uncomfortable situation, however my friend was quite upset that this server was asking for more money when she did not deserve a tip- she was lucky to get anything at this point.</li><li>The server stood there clueless and kept pointing out that it was n't a typical tip, to the point where my friend became upset, left the money on the table and stormed out- i could n't help but laugh at this point ... i feel awful now.</li><li>But the server grabbed the money from the table and took off to her manager !!</li><li>The next crappy part was that my coat was in coat check, so I had to approach another server to retrieve it.</li><li>The server that retrieved my coat was fantastic!</li><li>The original server looked confused and was still talking to the manager, she did n't seem to care that she left me with no coat to begin with.</li><li>Our server was nice too, and helped us take some photos as well as gave us some free hot sauce jars to take home.</li><li>C- Service: Our server was lovely.</li><li>When we brought the fact that the vegetable dish had very little variety of vegetables, our server responded by looking blankly at us and saying, `` so would anyone like to order desert ?</li><li>The server forgot that we ordered the spring roll appetizer and after 15 minutes asked us if we still wanted it because she forgot to put in the order.</li><li>20 minutes after we ordered the server brought out two spring rolls cut in half that looked like they were just brought out of the deepfryer and previously frozen.</li><li>The server never came back to ask us how our food was, never once.</li><li>Our server, Steven, was excellent.</li><li>Our server was great and went to double check with the manager regarding food ingredients, as my mother has food allergies.</li><li>The food was amazing, our server was extremely accomodating.</li><li>Unfortunately, we were unaware that there was a closet for our coats until we saw a server open it and hang a customer 's coat after we were already seated for some time.</li><li>We would have liked it if the server told us about the closet instead of having us find out ourselves.</li><li>The server told us that level 10 is considered suicide hot.</li><li>The server took about 15 minutes before coming over and asking if we would like anything to drink.</li><li>Our server was friendly and quite informative.</li><li>Had the crispy duck ( as recommended get the two legs for 3 bucks more, as suggested by the server.</li><li>Our server was quite efficient and friendly as well.</li><li>Also the server ( who I believe it was a manager) never came back to check up on us.</li><li>For mains we shared the crispy duck, where the server rips up 2 duck legs and you wrap it ala Peking duck style.</li><li>Our hostess also doubled as our server and she provided great service.</li><li>One star only cause the server was very friendly.</li><li>Pro tip: do not try to order your meal/ converse with the server in Vietnamese.</li><li>One of my pet peeves is when the server literally stands over you after handing over the bill, waiting for you to pay immediately while they wait.</li><li>The food is not bad but I am giving it one star for obnoxious service because the server and owner hassled one of our party about sending back a dish.</li><li>The server who took my order was unfriendly, but at least she got my order correct.</li><li>After I paid, the server came back with my change, but I noticed that it did n't add up.</li><li>The server asked us if we were sure if we wanted to order it several times.</li><li>They had those buttons on the side sign type of thing which u can press for the server, water, and any questions.</li><li>Upon arriving, the server was very friendly, greeted us and gave us the menu 's.</li><li>The first time this happened, I tried to give my order to a server who was n't our main server, and she was very confused.</li><li>Our main server told us that to avoid confusion because of our special ordering system, we should only give our orders to him.</li><li>The young server seemed just so impatient, she snapped a few times at us.</li><li>The extra star is really for the wonderful lady server who I believe was one of the owners.</li><li>There was only one server but the wait was n't long and the food was super fresh.</li><li>Our server ( maybe the owner ?) gave me several extra pitas to go with my leftovers when he saw me trying to save our remaining scraps ( oops).</li><li>I went in to eat with a friend and the server was nice and friendly.</li><li>One of the best parts, aside from my grandmother being very happy and loving her cheddar omelette, was the server.</li><li>What was quite upsetting was that the server did not seem to care for this mistake.</li><li>Overall most of the food was undercooked, the server lacked attentiveness, and I actually left more than 50% of my meal.</li><li>Wait staff does n't acknowledge you ( was n't til 10 minutes later she got our drink order), food came 30 mins after, the server 's excuse was `` we had a lot of chicken wing orders tonight''.</li><li>I asked, `` is there any drink specials ?'' she immediately walked away muttering with her back turned to us- `` i 'll get your server'' The only logic we came to the conclusion is that she is in charge of the patio area- and she is utterly disappointed that she wont have the pleasure of serving us.</li><li>There were 5 of us so we asked our server how much food would be enough for us and she said 6lbs of lobster from couple other dishes would be enough to fill us up.</li><li>Our server messed everything up.</li><li>Stay away from this restaurant you have been warned. it 'll be the first time and most likely the last time i 'll go there. i had high expectations of a place that has lobster in their name coupled with the fact that they are in one of the more higher end areas of the city. maybe that 's the downfall. from the outside, it looks like a place that you 'd find in a old strip mall, and the interior 's more of the same. when i saw that the food and wine menu were both laminated, i started to get an idea as to what i was getting myself into both pricewise and food quality. our server was not the most attentive to our needs even though we were a group of 12, and was noticibly pushing certain items on the menu. there were also a couple of kids with us and she was n't the most friendliest person with them, seemingly just focused on doin what she needed to do to make her coin and turning the table over. not that i find it wrong but it 's not something i 'd expect from a place that you 're paying up to $ 94 for a four pound lobster. me and my friend ordered garlic shrimps to start. they were of a decent size and flavour but were lacked presentation and quantity for what we paid. i 'm not really concerned with presentation that much on the regular but the plate they served it on made it look like we were n't getting a lot or we were missing something. we both ordered a 1lb lobster with baked potato and soup. we were informed that the french fries were not available which again i would n't expect from a place where you are paying so much for your meal. my soup was a new england clam chowder that was nothing special at all. the soup nutsy or even the marche had better. the baked potato was plain with just a small dollop of sour cream to consume it with. the final item to arrive was the lobster. i ordered for it to be broiled which it did but the ' stuff' ( cause i do n't really know what the heck they decided to put on it) just made it a very messy proposition to eat. it did n't really do much to enhance the enjoyment of the lobster, and it made me wonder was it really worth the coin i just dropped for this. the whole meal just tasted only just average. the whole experience was topped off when our bill came and our waitress almost made it a point to point out that the gratuity was not included in our bill. if you really want lobster, i would just say to go to red lobster and do it there. you 'd probably pay just the same but the service would definitely be better and so would the flavours !!</li><li>The customer service is ok, you may have a really nice server, or you can end up with a REALLY awful one.</li><li>But this time I was with my very Asian husband and were still passed by for 15 minutes when trying to wave down a server.</li><li>The service here was good and our server was kind enough to give us recommendations to get the most bang for our buck.</li><li>The service is fast ( once you get seated) and you do n't have one server as you just flag one down.</li><li>We realized that the server got the wrong order after a couple bites of it.)</li><li>However, once a server gets to your table, they do tend to be very friendly.</li><li>Sometimes the server forgets to bring it, but I do n't mind asking for it.</li><li>The pork belly was so so, and the chicken although tender and good quality, does not mix well with the spicy sauce The service was good considering that this place only has 1 server running around for all tables. although language is a bit of a barrier the server was nice and accommodating and you can tell she cares when suggesting you how to properly bbq the meat.</li><li>The pork belly was so so, and the chicken although tender and good quality, does not mix

server even placed them on the table.</li><li>We stopped a server and asked him how much longer for our meals, and he said 5 to .. maybe 10 more minutes.</li><li>No apologies from the server, just a weird look when we left.</li><li>The moment the server put the soup on my table i already smelled the non-freshness.</li><li>The server told me that 's because they made the soup in the morning and kept it boiling for a whole day.</li><li>The server canme back with a Siracha in her hand and apologized stating the manager refused to give us the spicy sauce .... poor customer service in Asian restaurants are expected.</li><li>So after a long time of waiting I went up to a server to ask for our appetizers ( I love their potatoes and that 's all I really wanted).</li><li>It took us about 10 mins to finally get the server 's attention that we 're ready to order.</li><li>The orders are n't cooked at your table anymore and instead the server uses a nearby empty table.</li><li>We were going to order a bibimbap, but when we placed the order, the server came back to us immediately and apologized that they were out of cooked rice for which to make our bibimbap.</li><li>We placed our order to the server and I swear five minutes after, we got our food!</li><li>The server may not be smiling all the time or have a harsh tone, they mean well.</li><li>The thoughtful server even brought hot water for the senior citizen in my group and cold water for the younger ones.</li><li>The server did politely explained they needed to do take outs thats is why ours took too long.</li><li>There was server when we needed one and a server checked in with us when we needed to be checked in.</li><li>Was delicious Our server was so helpful and actually genuinely helped us pick what to eat.</li><li>The server asked if I wanted a menu to get something else because he figured the 3rd attempt would n't be any better, but it had been over an hour since I asked for the steak and eggs and I was very hungry at this point.</li><li>Our server was busy pretending to be busy but he barely did his work.</li><li>We 've been sitting here waiting for our server to come to us for 15mins but she 's standing at the bar chatting with another server.</li><li>We 've been sitting here waiting for our server to come to us for 15mins but she 's standing at the bar chatting with another server.</li><li>I 'm reluctant to give them a 3, I 'm definitely not a fan of this place, except that this time we got a server that was decent.</li><li>This is the place to go when you do n't want your server to talk to you or go even near you.</li><li>Then the server did n't come to check up on us until later where we needed the bill ...</li><li>Servers do not know what customer service is .... our server came up piped there head in and said I 'll be with you in a minute `` not a hello how are you, my apologies you have been waiting for me to come by for 10 minutes.</li><li>Our server was really nice and the food came out quick.</li><li>( Although I have to complement the people they have for doing their best to keep things running smoothly, our server this time was great)- The food portions are a smaller than they used to be, including for items like fries and coleslaw.</li><li>We had a really nice meal and the service was pretty good since one server sticked to us the entire time.</li><li>When the family mentioned a peanut and nut allergy and asked if they could be careful to ensure that the chef ensure no cross contamination, the server said it was a hassle and too much effort.</li><li>The server carved the duck near our table.</li><li>Our server was pleasantly informative in explaining their 2-course Peking Duck meal ( $ 40 circa 2015).</li><li>What 's the point of a cook/chef to perfectly season my food when a server is gonna pour water over it ?</li><li>Only down fall was the server took down a wrong order and they made the food.</li><li>Shortly after a server arrives with your food.</li><li>The Asian server with glasses did n't smile and did n't seem very enthusiastic, smile and I would have given a tip:) Hard to understand the menu since everything is in Italian, it took 5 min of studying the ingredients to understand what was on the menu.</li><li>They did not have fresh pepper mills &amp; when I asked the server reluctantly got a pepper mill from another table &amp; rushed us to take it back!</li><li>Also just from observations, one of the servers did n't seem to be too great with communicating in English with a different table for some special requests, but another server came by quickly and smoothed things out.</li><li>I 've been a server for many years now and I understand servers need tips.</li><li>The service here was odd as one server looked as though she wanted us out as quickly as possible, while the other treated us as if we were celebrities.</li><li>As we were waiting for other food to come, we finished some of the side dishes and wanted refills, the server was n't too friendly when we asked and told us you can ONLY choose 3 to refill.</li><li>Apparently as I read reviews from fellow Yelpers, they also give you a free pancake with your side dishes, which we NEVER got! = ( When we got all our foods, we had to wait for rice, which took another 5 mins for the server to bring to us.</li><li>In about two minutes, our server came back and told me they were out of soondae.</li><li>When I pocketed the change, and already walked 100m away from the restaurant, a server ran after me bitching that I did n't tip them even though tipping is not mandatory.</li><li>I went on a week night, and at the start of the evening only one server was taking care of all the tables ( but I was there VERY early, like 4:30pm), but towards the end of our meal a couple more staff were there to help.</li><li>Response time was good, and server kept our tea topped up throughout the meal.</li><li>We had to walk all the way to the back of the restaurant and asked for everything that we needed, table, water, food .... our server wasnt friendly and got some attitudes.</li><li>So score one for the server looking to take care of the customer.</li><li>The server tends to ignore you after you ordered.</li><li>After we ordered our food, our server brought us a plate of side dishes of green salad, white radish, and macaroni salad.</li><li>My friend and I ordered one of the combo, and the server was n't able to fully explain to us what was included.</li><li>15 minute passed and I got my raspberry tart and I waited for another 10 minutes and asked our server where 's my friend 's cheese cake.</li><li>I wish I spoke Korean because the server 's English wasnt too good and gave me nods as I ordered.</li><li>Their server are very nice. and friendly.</li><li>Such a nice server and staff.</li><li>Service was meh, there were a few times when we saw the servers chatting, and it was only when I raised my hand that our server came over to us.</li><li>My friend paid with credit card, and our server was more than happy to entertain my request to break a $ 50 bill.</li><li>Another server was accommodating enough to serve some customers who chose to sit out on the patio on quite a chilly autumn day.</li><li>WiFi password was provided on the stand up menu as the server was prepping the table.</li><li>When it came to ordering, our lovely server who was polite recommended their Crepes.</li><li>My server looked as if she hated her job as well so her customer service was n't exactly the standard but another server who also helped me out was genuine.</li><li>My server looked as if she hated her job as well so her customer service was n't exactly the standard but another server who also helped me out was genuine.</li><li>One server walked by with her index finger firmed pressed into her eye digging for gold I believe.</li><li>Server was in a `` loud voice'' talking to us ( feels like she 's yelling) We ordered Large soup, grilled pork with rice &amp; a veggie rolls but The server asked us to order more since we were 4 in a table.</li><li>The buffet ( which is not all you can eat) is pretty cheap ( around $ 6) Your food is given to you by a server- they will give you a HUGE amount of carbs- usually either plain rice or pasta- I 'm talking two or three cups of rice, and then a smaller amount of protein ( whatever they 've made that day) quality ranges from pretty mediocre to quite good, but it 's pretty much luck of the draw as to what they decided to make that day.</li><li>Our server was delightful .. especially accommodating for a large group of 14 people having sunday lunch.</li><li>Server was nice enough and very attentive.</li><li>I was n't going to blame our server because I know the kitchen is at fault.</li><li>Patio is nice in the summer, but sometimes the server disappears and you 're left stranded.</li><li>I usually prefer to sit in the booths in the bar area, really easy to flag down a server if you 're in a rush and you get lots of TV 's to watch if the conversation gets boring.</li><li>The service was quite slow- we were served by the bartender rather than an actual server.</li><li>They were quick and a friendly server.</li><li>( Extra salsa and sour cream) server was on the ball and it did n't take long for us to pay and get on our way.</li><li>I had this one young lady server who was PERFECT!</li><li>The server was friendly and attentive.</li><li>It took the server a long time for him to clear our plates.</li><li>The server never came to check if we wanted anything ..</li><li>I was seated right away but it did take a long time before my server came back to take my order.</li><li>The young lady server wanted me to move my stroller, but we were given a tight spot.</li><li>The young man server knew I ordered udon and even tho my husband got his food first, mine came out 10 mins after and the person who came after me got his food first.</li><li>We waited at the front for at least two minutes before a server sat as down.</li><li>But we had already been seated and the server was nice.</li><li>The server simply replied `` I ca n't do anything about it.''</li><li>I bring that up with the server that if the USUAL complimentary soup and salad were extra charges then they should have mentioned that when we asked for it before bringing it out.</li><li>I asked the server this and was told `` Management wants customers to think we 're busy''.</li><li>Since this is a buffet, the only job of your server is to clear the dishes off of your table and to bring drinks to your table.</li><li>As always, the dishes at my table piled up while my server continued to walk around the dining area and collect dishes from other tables, I had to flag him down and tell him to take my dishes away.</li><li>I was beginning to feel a tad guilty, but I knew I had made the right decision when the server ripped the receipt and tossed it into my lap and walked away without a word.</li><li>The service was good, our server was helpful but a bit pushy for us to order, I guess it was because we got there fairy late and stayed until closing.</li><li>Our server was very nice.</li><li>I had asked if I could make substitutions and the server said np!</li><li>Also there was a long line because everyone was trying to individually split their bills themselves to pay so the server ended up having to do the math anyways to make sure the amounts added up!</li><li>I love this place .. all day breakfast is great and service is out of this world !! my server, both visits, remembered everything about my order from the time before which was about a month prior ..!</li><li>Friendly service and somewhat quick service since there was only 1 server.</li><li>There was only one server on duty.</li><li>The server was good but it took awhile to get our food.</li><li>Our server was great and the menu was quite diverse.</li><li>There was only one server and we had to wait quite a bit for our coffees to be refilled.</li><li>When it came to the bill, I had to go up to the counter to pay with my Visa and the server hovered over me the entire time.</li><li>When we were getting ready to leave, our server came over to collect our boxes and rudely informed us that service charges were not included in the bill, making it sound like we broke a law.</li><li>I ordered beef wonton amd the siumai was not there, i asked the server and she stirred my bowl and asked if it was not there, after a few minutes they brought 1 siu mai cut in half where the order should have had more, the server did not even apologized and was very lousy on the service, this is the last time i am coming here- for the price, the restaurant should provide better service.</li><li>I ordered beef wonton amd the siumai was not there, i asked the server and she stirred my bowl and asked if it was not there, after a few minutes

the restaurant should provide better service.</li><li>I give them 5 stars because the server was very attentive, and took the time to explain to us how to eat the nurungji- that 's the scorched rice in the stone pot, after they have scooped out the rice for you.</li><li>The server will scoop the rice from a clay pot into a bowl, then fill the bowl with water, forming some sort of rice snack that people enjoy eating later.</li><li>The server was not able to communicate very well but he did provide very quick service so that was a plus.</li><li>However, it may be difficult to get the server 's attention because the place gets pretty busy.</li><li>I really did n't know what I was ordering but our server soon showed up with some familiar looking condiments- kimchi, pickled radish, bean sprouts, and some beans.</li><li>Our server made a note of our license plate numbers in case somebody needed to get out.</li><li>Served in a scalding hot container, the server moves quickly to serve this into bowls for everyone at the table and then tops off the remains with rice so those interested can eat the mushy remains later once cooled.</li><li>Once I saw one of the employees having a loud argument with one of the customers about something, I was sitting far away and could n't really tell what they were arguing about, but in any circumstance I would never yell at any customer if I was the server.</li><li>The server also brought along an egg for us to crack into our soup, and a pot of rice.</li><li>I admit it is my fault and I asked for another egg but the server either forgot or just bluntly ignored me.</li><li>It cooked after a while, but it would have been nice if the server brought our attention to the eggs and told us to crack an egg into our bowls while the soup was still hot.</li><li>The server, though he was a nice enough, was pretty much unable to help us since his English was broken at best.</li><li>When we called our server to address the issue, he just blank faced lied and said that was n't the case.</li><li>Food was brought out to us really quick, although the server brought my girlfriend something different from what she had ordered.</li><li>Second time I came, my friend was working there as a server.</li><li>Without me even asking, the server noticed and asked if I had any allergies and then got a chef to cook with separate ingredients on another iron griddle!</li><li>I asked the server to check on our order because by now we had already put in our second set of order.</li><li>It took forever to get a server.</li><li>For most of the evening the server did n't check on us.</li><li>The server hands you a few order sheets, and you mark down the quantity of each item desired, whether it 's sushi, appetizers, soups, noodles, hot dishes, etc., and they make everything to order.</li><li>Upon complaining, i was told that is the only way it is served despite the server confirming my request for med rare.</li><li>We attempted to place our order after repeating it several times, and once the one beverage order was confirmed the server on drive-through rudely asked `` what else ?!''</li><li>She then passed the order to another server.</li><li>The server are not friendly!</li><li>The server has to try the juice herself before giving it to us.</li><li>Our server was nice and we did n't feel rush or pressured to hurry.</li><li>Our server shows up after a few minutes explaining to us that we have to pay a $ 5 cover and I explained to her the conversation I had with waitress #1 about our cover.</li><li>Both by the hostess and our server.</li><li>Our server knew what she was doing and was very confident about the menu.</li><li>One thing to point out during this visit was that the soda we ordered tasted like it was lying out for hours- no fizz or chill, we had to send it back and the server did not seem to like that we did that.</li><li>I had a server who did not disclose that to me and I was a little pissed.</li><li>And the server who named Parker is very rude, I do n't know why the restaurant hire such a person to be server !!!</li><li>I have never waited so long to simply have a server come over, as we actually ended up timing it because it became that absurd, it took the server 20-25 MINUTES to even come over to our table to greet us.</li><li>We ordered and the food was out shortly, as my mother ordered the Montreal smoked meat sandwich ( as it is her favourite anywhere we go), there was something quite rancid tasting about the meat, it had an odd smell and colour to the meat, as we were already in a rush from waiting so long for service we would n't have had time to choose another menu item/send it back, but that would not have mattered since our server did not come by once to check on how the food was.</li><li>As we waiting for another lengthy period of time ( no server was even passing through the dining room this entire time) the sandwich was left there with two single bites taken out of it, with no questions as to how it was and why we did n't eat it, she quickly scurried away to get the check.</li><li>The side plate smell like sanitizer ！ ！ The server has wired attitude.</li><li>The server said it 's good for 2 people, but comes with a lot more than 2 person portion- just think of it as proportional to the individual pork bone soup ( 8.99).</li><li>They have a call button at each table so you do n't have to wave down a server when you need something.</li><li>Another server proceeded to raise his voice at us and told us, `` You should read the menu.</li><li>I defensively replied back and stated that my boyfriend and I both work in the restaurant industry ( cook and server respectively) and he stormed away.</li><li>Ruined our day because the server attacked my girlfriend with the same speech ..</li><li>The kimchi fried rice came out .. and we starting munching on that .... and we got through half of it ... and called the server over ... and they totally forgot about our order of kalbi.</li><li>You 're ignored until you flag down a server or ring a bell.</li><li>There was a lot of left overs and when they were taking it away we asked if they were going to throw it out ( we would have loved to take it home) and the server said that they reuse the food.</li><li>But, I was tired of getting only 4 wings per order so I kindly asked for my last 3 rounds all at once and our server obliged.</li><li>Our lovely server which i did n't get the name of quickly came to us and asked us if we wanted any drinks then we ordered the food.</li><li>Our server was very attentive so we waited a little before she came back to check up on us.</li><li>When we got the server 's attention, we told her about the like hockey pucks and this time we ordered something saucy so there should be a less likely chance of being dry and tasteless.</li><li>Another round ? again about 25 minutes passed and the server took our next order. we switched back to regular wings to avoid cracking our teeth on the dry chicken nuggets.</li><li>I notified the server and she looked at me as if I was joking, putting my own hair.</li><li>Seconds later our first server is here with hot tea and the menus.</li><li>Our server sat us down, took my order paper, and was nvr seen again.</li><li>But do n't expect Western style pampering where the server tries to make small talk with you.</li><li>SERVICE: It took more than 30 minutes to close the bill because our server neglected our table.</li><li>Our server explicitly confirmed that he had done so but as we exited the parking garage realized this was not the case.</li><li>Service was slow but It was obvious her and the other server in the restaurant were over stressed.</li><li>The server came to take my order, and I got a water while I waited.</li><li>Our server got my latte order incorrect, but I think that was probably because I did n't specify.</li><li>( Funny moment of our visit: My friend asked our young server if she could nuke her pie `` for, like, two seconds''- to which the server replied, `` You mean, like, LITERALLY for two seconds ?''</li><li>It took so long for the server to come back and ask about another drink or the bill, that I had to actually get up and go to the counter and ask if I could receive the bill.</li><li>I do n't want to provide a poor review based on what could be just a poor server, but it certainly tainted my view of Cafe Mirage.</li><li>Went in for a quick dinner weeknight, our server was real nice and cheerful, ordered the pizza ( as it was listed as freshly made in the kitchen) and did not disappoint. there was abit of an accident on the ocean harvest ( and there were way too much of grilled pepper in the dish), but the manager got it taken care of for us diligently.</li><li>My server came by to check and ask how we are doing.</li><li>The service was a bit un-attentive, but our server was nice and it did seem like the waitresses were pretty stretched out between al the tables, but the service did n't really get any better when the place started clearing out later into the meal so take that as you will.</li><li>We were greeted by a charming server who took our order promptly and delivered it piping hot in about 15 minutes.</li><li>Our server was charming, funny, accommodating and personable- again, another difference in comparison to my recent visit to La Vecchia.</li><li>The server recommended we taste their famed coconut pie next time.</li><li>Once seated and having a chance to look at our menu, a miserable woman introduced herself as our server.</li><li>Food arrived hot and fast ( I 'm the only 1 there, so ymmv) My server got me a coffee immediately, asked numerous times about my dining experience brought refills ...</li><li>The server greeted, seated, and took our order right away.</li><li>It could have only been because of the server `` Paula'' we had, as I am sure there are other servers at this location who probably are not as good as Paula.</li><li>Paula also brought extra serviettes to each and every table she had which showed that she is a VERY organized server.</li><li>The server, David, was attentive and cordial.</li><li>Our server was mostly missing in action despite that.</li><li>Our server was abrupt from the start.</li><li>If they had a peanut-free menu but the server keeps telling you that your meal may have come in contact with, or contains peanuts, would you feel safe eating their food ?</li><li>When I told the server she took my grapefruit juice off the bill total.</li><li>Me and my friend simply made a request for a side-dish refill- and asked again as we have not seen in for quiet sometime- and the server simply yelled at us `` It 's coming!'' and the server who brought our side dishes were grumbling in Korean which we did not understand.</li><li>Me and my friend simply made a request for a side-dish refill- and asked again as we have not seen in for quiet sometime- and the server simply yelled at us `` It 's coming!'' and the server who brought our side dishes were grumbling in Korean which we did not understand.</li><li>I do n't think there 's server a time that we 've received service the first 2 times requesting it.</li><li>The pressing-the-button to call for the server did not work out very well if used more than maybe 3 times.</li><li>We were waiting a very long time to have our order taken, and it had not occurred to us that the ONLY way to contact a server was with that door-bell button.</li><li>Oh and do n't bother pressing the button to catch the attention of a server.</li><li>After we were ready to order, we pushed the service button like three times before calling a server passing our table to take our order.</li><li>The server had dropped the good off and walked away.</li><li>Finally, I told the server and she said oh okay then walked away.</li><li>I rang the bell for 5-6 times in total and finally the server came, because my mom stood up and waived at the server ......</li><li>It took us so long for us to wave down the server each time to: 1. order 2. get water 3. ask for more gas in our canister 4. remind her of the fact we are still waiting for new gas canisters ( while raw meat is half cooked on the grill) which was suppose to be table cooking style but because she was so busy, she dumped the whole plate of meat on the table grill and left it sitting there before we realize they started cooking but wanted us to finish cooking.</li><li>If you sit in one of the closed booths, there is a button on the wall ( unless someone took it home as a souvenir) which you can press and the server will come.</li><li>Like what was mentioned in other posts, our server was very careless and unfriendly.</li><li>It 's still difficult to get a server 's attention, but when I was there last, it seemed like they were deliberately ignoring us.</li><li>Our server had a sense of humour and was willing to guide our lunch choices based on preferences for dry/wet dishes and a good balance of flavours.</li><li>I 'm guessing she was new to being a server ?</li><li>Food arrived fast but the server did n't hear everyone 's appetizer order so I was stuck eating an appetizer alone.</li><li>I could n't concentrate ordering with my server because yes the singing was bad.</li><li>Our server was super nice, my friend often sees her and she is very sweet and courteous.</li><li>The server took our order and suggested us some `` complimentary'' appetizers with bread ( there were olives, grilled eggplant and some others- most were really good).</li><li>Btw, our server was very nice but alas, I ca n't remember her name.</li><li>I was so happy to see that the same server we 've had is still there and still dishing up in his quirky, hospitable manner.</li><li>The birthday girl ( mom), got a little something special done to her dish as I alerted our quirky server it was her birthday.</li><li>As for service, it was ok .. at times I felt the server felt annoyed.</li><li>With only $ 20 for a set lunch, you ca n't beat it. service was terrible. waited 45 minutes before we could stop a server and ask to order. was going to order a bottle of wine but decided not to.</li><li>Our server arrived at the table shortly after we were seated and was enthusiastic, personable, and had a good sense of humor.</li><li>We waited for 10 min with our server walking passed us.</li><li>I had to ask hostess to identify our server so we could order drinks.</li><li>The server never came to check on second meal.</li><li>The server is very nice.</li><li>I had nothing bad to say until I saw the slow server barely crawling to my table to deliver food with her hand in her pocket.</li><li>We called over another server ( who was a little bit faster) and requested for the fried bananas again.</li><li>The service is not fast but they ask you if everything is OK every time the server comes to your table.</li><li>I believe the Lady who is a server is the owner as well and it seems everybody is afraid of her.</li><li>I asked the server where the parking is she said it 's in the back, I have never found it.</li><li>The service was good, the server attentive and ready to refill my tea and Miso Soup.</li><li>For the most part, the server 's English was good enough.</li><li>I sat for an HOUR with an empty glass of water -- and could n't even get the server to pay attention enough to order more sake.</li><li>Our server was also AMAZING.</li><li>The new manager is some young guy who 's ego is way bigger than it should be. and the server had a bad attitude and did n't do a good at replenishing drinks or cleaning tables.</li><li>After deciding what to order, we waited patiently but did n't see our server in sight; mind you the place is n't very large.</li><li>Our server did not come by to check on our meal until the very end when we had finished our food.</li><li>We watched as our server went to the front and asked the manager about this deal.</li><li>Our server was nice but the hot water my family asked for was lukewarm ( without lemon slices like some other places).</li><li>I came here for lunch with a friend and the server was speaking a bit fast, so when he asked if we wanted the buffet or menu, I asked how much the buffet was, and heard $ 18.99.</li><li>The server, a man with curly hair about 5 ' 9 that appeared south asian, said yes, we could definitely do that.</li><li>Our server finished his shift and an east asian man with not the greatest customer skills billed us for both my pepperoni pizza and the buffet.</li><li>The employees seemed very fresh, as the girl struggled to squeeze the whipped cream onto the plate nicely and the male server I had gave my friend and I a strange look when we said we were just there for dessert.</li><li>Shortly after finishing our meals, one of the staff members ( not our original server ?) lets us know that they were having a promo: cake was 2 slices for the price of 1.</li><li>Our server was a guy ( ca n't remember his name) &amp; he was great.</li><li>Our server went on break &amp; another server a lady took over for him.</li><li>Our server went on break &amp; another server a lady took over for him.</li><li>The server gave us a discount on the dessert &amp; we left bewildered.</li><li>Our first server was great.</li><li>The second server kinda strange.</li><li>I called a few days before to ask if they did anything for birthdays and they said to come in and notify the server.</li><li>Our server was friendly and attentive and kept himself busy around the restaurant.</li><li>We were seated on the patio, our server never came to ask us what we wanted to drink even.</li><li>Service was n't all that great, as our server did n't seem to want to be there.</li><li>2) The server had filthy, long fake nails, and a bar stamp ( presumably from the night prior) still on her hand -- is hand washing not required here ? 3) the timing of everything was horrendous.</li><li>The server was not even apologetic.</li><li>Our server was very attentive and super sweet, considering the many requests our group had with a party of 4 children in tow.</li><li>Our server for the evening was friendly and on top of everything!</li><li>Good:- Our server was attentive and pleasant, great job- Salad was reasonably fresh- Fries were pretty good Okay:- Wings were passable, certainly not `` best in the city'' as stated on the menu Bad:- Ribs ... like other reviews noted I 'm pretty sure they 're boiled, not smoked ... perhaps thrown into some sort of smoker briefly after they 're cooked but certainly not smoked over a long period of time, which is disappointing for a place with `` smoke house'' in its name- The chicken was dry and had very little taste, also not at all `` smoked'' like it says on the menu- The `` pulled pork'' was just ... wrong.</li><li>All the meat was dry and the best meat was the wings, but that was even fairly average. they do have free refills on drinks and the server was rather attentive and nice. but the food and the atmosphere does n't cut it for me to want to come back.</li><li>On the bright side the service was really good and the one server working the patio was really quick and very helpful.</li><li>The server ( owner ?) was super helpful and they eventually worked it out, but apparently it 's a summer dish.</li><li>My server left 1/2 way thru my visit- her day was done.</li><li>Another server ( owner ?) took over.</li><li>J. W came about 35 mins after me so the pretty Korean servers were probably feeling sorry for me lol I ordered a small hot sake and the server was like just ... for ...</li><li>Our server Andrew was very friendly, and constantly checking up on us.</li><li>Beer was decent but server was horrible.</li><li>Our server was very nice and even though the place was busy checked on us time to time.</li><li>When our drinks needed refills no one was there to take care of that and when we tried looking for our server she was no where to be found.</li><li>One star for the nice server who called us a cab and brought us waters when the bartender rudely informed our party of 6 that she was closing soon and did n't welcome us for a drink.</li><li>Our server was named Gloria and she was attentive and apologized for the wait and how busy it was.</li><li>Our server, as nice as she was, was n't helpful in any way.</li><li>The service here is friendly and they try to be nice but the main server that I always see ( older moustached gentleman) ca n't hide his impatience and is a bit condescending when you ask about menu items.</li><li>We had a great server, unfortunately there was only 1 of her.</li><li>Even the Ice Cream took forever to come and then the server slams my friends empty bowl on top of mine and leaves without a word.</li><li>We had a server who not only forgot to check on us after serving our appetizers and main courses but forgot the main course for one of our party.</li><li>Our server was very polite and intuitive, knowing which dishes we wanted to share and when to take away our empty plates.</li><li>We came in as a group of 9 to enjoy a late breakfast/lunch- everything was great until we met our server.</li><li>When we told the server she yelled back saying that 's how it comes from the kitchen.</li><li>My particular server was nice, and I happen to know it was the kitchen that forgot to give me my ketchup.</li><li>However, the other server that I spoke to momentarily had a bit of attitude.</li><li>The server was constantly changing, some were very nice, some were iffy.</li><li>Also when the plates do reach the area of a table it can sit for a few minutes on a tray waiting for a server.</li><li>When we ordered one of the beef noodle dishes, the server pointed out it was cold so we quickly changed our minds.</li><li>When we were leaving, the server lady came over to ask for extra tips ( at least 10% of the total in her words).</li><li>However, there was one lady server that had better English and helped us correct our bill when it was wrong.</li><li>The server was friendly in the beginning, coming back with side dishes and water.</li><li>The server said that they did accept credit card/debit card and cash.</li><li>The 1st server ( there were only two servers), seated our party of 6 and decided to put a table of 6 and 4 together.</li><li>What was n't so pleasant was the 2nd server that came up to us and `` you 're not supposed to have two tables''.</li><li>We were taken aback and just said that the other server arranged it for us.</li><li>The 2nd server gave a cut-eye stare at the 1st server.</li><li>The 2nd server gave a cut-eye stare at the 1st server.</li><li>When I finally flagged down the server, after several attempts of pressing the button and waving her down, I asked her if we could get some bowls to put our pork bone in.</li><li>Once I placed my order, the server was trying to take my coworkers menu right from her hand as she was asking questions.</li><li>Not just one server, but several of them.</li><li>But when I was a server, I would quietly slip the bill and indicate that whenever they 're ready to pay, I 'm available.</li><li>At 3:10, the server returns with a credit-card machine while my dad literally has a spoonful of dessert to his mouth.</li><li>Clearly irritated, he politely comments that he was in the middle of his dessert and therefore not quite ready to pay, the server goes off about how they need to close out the cash by 3:30.</li><li>I would have spoken to the manager, but I actually overheard another couple requesting a server to speak with the manager about something else, and the server refused, saying she was speaking on behalf of the manager.</li><li>I would have spoken to the manager, but I actually overheard another couple requesting a server to speak with the manager about something else, and the server refused, saying she was speaking on behalf of the manager.</li><li>The restaurant is clean and our server, Rosita was very friendly and eager.</li><li>This time around a server came and helped me, enthusiastically filling my bowl and directing me to the grill.</li><li>I 've also had times where a server would check up on my table, which is what I call a `` rare event'' because Chinese restaurants are usually very poor in service.</li><li>Surprisingly the food came out decently quick and one of the server even came up and apologized for one of the dish because the bok choy were not the fresh .. so we cancelled it even though it was already made.</li><li>I asked for a cup of water without ice ( as I usually get brain freeze on ice), guess the server saw I brought my Advil with me, she brought me a cup of slightly warm water !!</li><li>Our server, Al was fantastic and really helped make the night fun.</li><li>So obviously the server was super nice to us.</li><li>Oh, and super + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + They comped my Kulfi and the RIce for us:) No reason, the server just let us know with a smile!</li><li>I appreciate that the server gave me a 20% discount coupon when I picked up my order, but I shall not be using it ever!</li><li>The server asked if we were n't going to order rice or naan, upon which we realized they didnt come with rice or naan.</li><li>One other thing I did n't like was how our server did not ask how the food was but whether we 'd like to order more food, which felt like she was pushing us to order more.</li><li>The server was really nice and quickly took our plates after we ate.</li><li>Our server took our drinks order first so that we can have a few more minutes to decide what to order when she returned.</li><li>The server immediately greeted us with a smile and gave us our menus asking what we wanted to drink.</li><li>Breakfast was good but as I finished my my meal the server came over and asked if we wanted dessert so I ordered bread pudding with rum sauce, as I get half way threw a notice something sticking out the edge so to my surprise I find the bread tag baked into the pudding.</li><li>Our server, Angela was excellent!</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
