the chocolate mousse which was quite nice with a bitter green tea.</li><li>I think I am ready for dessert !!</li><li>Had the Apple and Sour Cherry Crumble for dessert.</li><li>Although we were n't expecting it, and it is not necessary, most restaurants make some kind of a goodwill gesture, when they know there has been a problem with the food- a drink, a dessert, something.</li><li>I 've had dessert here as well, and was very impressed with the creme brulee.</li><li>I highly recommend that for dessert.</li><li>Dessert was a chocolate caramel banana combination with popcorn.</li><li>The

ordered dessert she came out a few minutes later to inform us that they did n't have the ice cream that the pecan pie should come with.</li><li>Another example if pettiness, when they are missing an ingredient for a $ 9 dessert they ca n't spare an extra scoop of ice cream ?</li><li>Had the seafood pancake as well ( too much Mayo/bad filling-to-seafood ratio) and the dessert ( ice cream- red bean/green tea/black bean) is great, although an additional price.</li><li>For the dessert, I chose the Crème Caramel which was okay but did not taste very fresh.</li><li>For dessert I ordered a peanut butter fudge brownie cake.</li><li>My husband got to watch the raptors game and my daughter enjoyed the chicken finger kids meal that was $ 10 that came with the drink and a dessert!</li><li>Pros Great Dessert Good food Not really any service Cons Meat came after the salad Looked stupid waiting for the waiter to take our order ... will look cool next time i guess.</li><li>I think once you come here enough, they give you a little something for dessert as well.</li><li>Free soup, but no dessert.</li><li>Best Veal in town!: hell yea! tenderized, and full of flavor, not excessively breaded, not chewy, just perfecto! served with the al-dente spaghetti and marinara! que belissima! 4.5/5 Tartufo! 4/5 chocolata served with whipped cream, and crackers ..... great way to end off the dessert.</li><li>They had a table available so started to seat us but when I indicated to them that we were there for dessert, they said `` I 'm sorry, we do n't do that''.</li><li>Somehow, some way, we still had room for dessert.</li><li>Also the dessert was excellent!</li><li>Not to mention we got yoduly drinks for dessert!</li><li>This is wholesome Vietnamese home cooking at its finest, and for a twenty you 'll get a plate of rice, barbacued pork chop, a bowl of the famous Vietnamese beef noodle soup the size of your head and a three colored shake for dessert.</li><li>Food comes out randomly which sometimes works and sometimes does n't. .. like when we got the banana fritters ( dessert) before the spicy crab.</li><li>Near the end when we ordered dessert, did the takoyaki and grilled eggplant finally arrive.</li><li>It has the standard fare of sashimi, rolls, hot foods, cold apps, dessert and drinks, just as it does with forgetful service and not serving you 100% of what you asked for.</li><li>For those of you who like dessert, Sushi Legend offers quite a few selections!</li><li>Oh but was the dessert ever TERRIBLE !!!</li><li>So just order like 5 shots of mango pudding and mango yogurt because that 's the best dessert.</li><li>Dessert could n't save this restaurant either.</li><li>Second, they do not have ginger milk as a dessert on the menu.</li><li>It differs with choices like goat curry, stew chicken, and miscellaneous cake slices for dessert.</li><li>I ordered it hoping there would be actual pineapples but it was fried chicken with pineapple sauce ... thats an oops on my part: ( Halo halo is really good for dessert if you have a sweet tooth but it was a bit too sweet for my liking.</li><li>No room for dessert.</li><li>For dessert they have a selection of homemade gelatos, and my kids tell me that Donatello is the best.</li><li>Ive been to this restaurant numerous times and till this day still get the chicken schnitzel with the home fries, cucumber salad and the cherry streusel for dessert but the best appetizer to get is the most amazing fried cheese it is absolutely the best thing I 've had in my whole life l love going there it is one of my favourite restaurants.</li><li>Even though the fried ice-cream for dessert was good and the portion was large and reasonably priced for $ 6 and the seafood entree was really very good, I ca n't see myself going back to this restaurant.</li><li>Food was amazing as usual, but the dessert was a definite pleasant surprise.</li><li>The dessert- Strawberries panna cota- was spectacular.</li><li>What really bugged me was that once dessert was served, were were totally ignored.</li><li>We had mango freeze for dessert.</li><li>For dessert we got 1 slice of orange.</li><li>At first bite, it tasted a bit too cold- like it had been in the fridge for the day ( not the freshest, but I did n't expect it to be) but it was an overall yummy dessert- had notes of the coffee with remnants of liquor and it was presented beautifully.</li><li>My family is such a fatty that it is definite that we did not leave this place hungry, even though I can recall that we did go to Dairy Queen after for dessert, which has become a ritual for us ............ lol such fatties.</li><li>The tiramisu also went over really well, but I was too stuffed to have any dessert by then.</li><li>According to the waiter, this dessert was made in the restaurant ( unlike the cheesecake that was the other choice ... from Cheescake Factory).</li><li>For dessert I had the deep fried milk pudding.</li><li>The dessert was a little on the small side but it was good.</li><li>The dessert was much smaller than we had anticipated, but the deep friend `` roll'' was perfectly done.</li><li>The desserts level a lot to be desired but there lots of places to go for dessert in the plaza.</li><li>Dessert was a bit of a savior to the meal, I had a trifle with fruit.</li><li>I was there for the 25 dollar dinner, which provided a choice of appertizer, soup or salad, an entree, and a dessert.</li><li>For dessert I had papaya ice cream because I was so full, and my girlfriend had the sweet mango sticky rice which was actually two small bits and not heavy looking at all.</li><li>The only time she came back was to clear our dishes and ask us if we wanted to order any dessert.</li><li>The dessert was good as well ( such as the fried mango).</li><li>By dessert I was so full but could n't resist the deep fried bananas with lychee and pineapple ice cream.</li><li>For dessert I got the fried bananas and honey.</li><li>The dessert I had the fried bananas which was timbit shaped banana bites with a honey sauce- it did n't come with any ice cream or whipped cream as I expected.</li><li>The manager came by to tell us because of a printing problem and that is why our remaining items were delayed, but he arranged it so that we 'd get our entree soon and the dessert would be to go.</li><li>In the end, they gave us an extra dessert on the house.</li><li>I had the mango sticky rice for dessert but it was very sweet thus I poked at it a little.</li><li>For dessert, the portions are smaller for their prices, but a good selection of choices.</li><li>Dessert was deep fried banana/ yams/ apple i personally preferred the apple.</li><li>And when we asked to order dessert he was giving us attitude on how we ordered and it took them like 10 min to bring the ice cream!</li><li>If I order my dessert at the beginning, are you going to give it to me at the end ?</li><li>We had a bit of a dessert mix-up, where one of my dining companions got vanilla instead of mango ice cream, but it was n't the end of the world.</li><li>It 's a good portion for dessert!</li><li>For dessert, you ca n't go wrong with baklava and armenian coffee, a perfect ending to a perfect Armenian meal!</li><li>We are too full to order any dessert.</li><li>She gave us extra lobster, extra lobster bisque, extra salads, extra dessert at the end.</li><li>For dessert I really enjoy the golden milk pudding with sugar on top.</li><li>I was hoping there was free dessert, like most Cantonese restaurants when there 's like a group of 8 or more.</li><li>I think there should be at least one complimentary dessert.</li><li>Each meal ordered there was a main course + a special drink + dessert.</li><li>Their daily specials come with the tea but no dessert.</li><li>Their lunches on their menu come with a dessert, which is usually a pudding of some sort with evaporated milk.</li><li>Also, the meals come with a mini dessert, usually a small square of mango pudding served with evaporated milk.</li><li>The dessert that came with the `` full dinner'' had old `` whipped cream'' which was probably cool whip.</li><li>Then we ordered tiramisu but there were no lady fingers included with the dessert.</li><li>Dessert was sweet tofu soup.</li><li>The dessert is very good.</li><li>Finally, we had a chinese taro pastry for dessert.</li><li>Tofu flower for dessert.</li><li>Then in the middle of waiting for our dessert, the dude who took our order comes and tells us that they forgot to charge us for the shrimp and asked us to pay for the difference.</li><li>They do bring your food to your table after a few minutes which is normal, yet when we asked for our dessert we were told to go back to the bar and inform them.</li><li>[ Dessert ] Not exactly sure what it was called but for dessert we had some type of rolled up baked dough stuffed with Nutella and served with caramel gelato.</li><li>[ Dessert ] Not exactly sure what it was called but for dessert we had some type of rolled up baked dough stuffed with Nutella and served with caramel gelato.</li><li>They are very generous with the side dishes and a fruit for dessert.</li><li>There 's always room for dessert!</li><li>We had the sweet potatoe crepes for dessert and the creme brulee, which was dissapointing.</li><li>Love coming here for dessert!</li><li>It also comes with whipped cream to add some richness to this sweet sweet dessert.</li><li>I came here a few nights ago with another couple just to have some good food and catch up:) I liked how this place has both savory and sweet crepes for people who want to eat `` dinner'' or `` dessert''.</li><li>The portions are pretty huge- so if you 're going there with an empty stomach you can eat the crepe/waffle by yourself no problem! but the waffle is definitely more filling, so if you are just going to have a small dessert, go with a friend and share:).</li><li>Shaved ice has become a largely popular dessert in recent years and is perfect for a hot summer day.</li><li>Again this is a very light and fluffy dessert.</li><li>Generally Pastel 's dessert are n't overly rich, heavy or extremely sweet but they certainly have a lot of unique flavours such as sweet potato, black sesame and taro.</li><li>The green tea flavoured was n't too sweet nor bitter and the dessert was a good amount for two people.</li><li>The taste of pistachio is strong but not too overwhelming and it is not too sweet- even though this dessert is not made in-house.</li><li>And then we look down to all 4 of our individual savoury crepes ... bc we are gonna order 4 more sweet crepes for dessert hahaha I hope pastel stays in business forever.</li><li>My friend never had black seasme ice cream and he was very pleased with the entire dessert.</li><li>The price is not bad at all for such a good dessert.</li><li>Another thing that the dessert house has made unique was the fact that certain ice creams are homemade at the restaurant!</li><li>Coming from Union Social Eatery ( review will be up in a day or so [ [ shamelessly self-promoting ] ]) I was craving for some good dessert.</li><li>The dessert is so fantastic ( the shaved green tea ice cream is heaven in your mouth), and the atmosphere is very relaxed.</li><li>Perfect place for dessert!</li><li>I 've been Pastel a few times for dessert but recently tried this place out for lunch.</li><li>Came in tonight with my hubby for a quick dessert.</li><li>For dessert I had the Mixed Fruit Ice Cream Parfait and my friend had the Creme Brulee!</li><li>It 's a small dessert house with maybe 20 seats in TOTAL.</li><li>So you want some good dessert in North York ?</li><li>Located in North York in the Yonge/Finch area, this place is a great joint to have coffee and dessert.</li><li>The green tea ice cream is very good and it 's infinitely better than the complimentary ones you get for dessert after sushi.</li><li>Food wise, I highly recommend their crepes ( dessert or hot) and a cup of their lattes.</li><li>Crowded seating is not ideal for dessert house or any intimate conversation.</li><li>But for those who seek for real quality dessert and relaxing ambiance- there are better out there!</li><li>The best dessert in Toronto.</li><li>The `` green tea frosty flakes'' is an incredible dessert featuring various authentic flavours!</li><li>My boyfriend and I stopped by on the weekend to grab some yummy dessert.</li><li>Too bad, I liked the dessert but no thanks.</li><li>Overall, the dessert looks better than it tastes.</li><li>AMAZING dessert.</li><li>The dessert came quick even though the place was full.</li><li>Would recommend for coming with your girl friends or going out as a couple for dessert.</li><li>Every crevice of the waffle had nuts sitting in it* crunch crunch* It 's a wonderful clean place I dropped by for dessert especially after dinner.</li><li>I was n't as impressed with the much more limited entrees ( a plate of chicken of different styles of cooking), but the pastries for dessert were good.</li><li>As much as people may not like the set up or the idea of helping to serve themselves, it is a cool concept because you can check out all of the stations, take in the delicious scents and really feel out what you are craving for your meal or your dessert.</li><li>Only ice-cream was offered for dessert, nice flavors but the smallest serving of ice-cream I 've ever had.</li><li>Also with every meal you order comes with miso soup, salad and green tea ice cream for dessert ( almost every meal).</li><li>Some faves include the prime rib, crab legs ( cold better than hot), spicy chicken, bbq pork ribs, wings, dimsum, fried fish w Tartar, scallop cutlets, the hot waffles with strawberries and whipped cream, the macaroons, and the creme brulee for dessert.</li><li>This store is right by my boyfriend 's condo, so it 's somewhere we go on occasion ( ok, maybe more than an occasion) to get a dessert and walk around.</li><li>We got one of the boat specials which also came with soup, salad, dessert and shrimp tempera, and added in a chicken teriyaki bento box.</li><li>Last but not the least, I definitely recommend the halo halo for dessert for obvious reasons- it 's the bomb.</li><li>Apparently it 's like a dessert ... they pour water into the stone bowl, and it slowly cools as you eat your meal.</li><li>I 'm not a fan of the water rice ( dessert) so this time I asked if they do n't put the water, and letting the rice sitting there during our meal, it became crispy and yummy.</li><li>Heres the breakdown: The staff attending to us was not friendly, anything we ordered he would be rude and tell us they dont have anymore. for example ... soup of the day ? no ... hamachi neck ? no ... hot and sour soup ? no .... beef skewer ? ... no ... mango yogurt for dessert ? no ....</li><li>For dessert, I got the mango pudding, and noticed it tasted funny.</li><li>The cappuccino was strong and paired well with the dessert.</li><li>As for the food itself ... possibly one of the WORST foods I 've ever had in my life .. the chicken was pretty much ALL just bone chunks and the sauce was soo sticcky from sitting out in the open for so long and I could n't take it ... okay maybe their dessert will be better ?</li><li>Dessert was horrifying and would never order again.</li><li>Dessert was excellent.</li><li>We will try something different every time, but we almost always order these dishes:- Glutinous rice roll with Chinese donuts and meat floss fillings- Wonton in in spicy peanut sauce- Rolled onion cake with slices of beef- Dan Dan noodles in spicy peanut sauce- for dessert, my MIL loves the deep fried Chinese donuts with red bean paste filling.</li><li>Dessert was fried egg whites covered in sugar, and house dessert soup of red bean, purple rice, and tapioca.</li><li>The complimentary dessert was provided to us while we were still making inroads on the mains.</li><li>Service is quite good Food: come in large portions with a very reasonable price They give you free red bean soup as dessert.</li><li>I 've been to the restaurant a few times and thought that the service was terrible, the food was average, and the dessert was okay.</li><li>Some of the dessert is good as well but nothing exceptional.</li><li>Went with a group of friends to have dessert.</li><li>Would not come back for dessert.</li><li>One of them ordered the dessert I briefly mentioned earlier in my review.</li><li>I can usually drink an espresso black, no sugar or milk as the sugar in the dessert is always sufficient.</li><li>THe appetizer was good; the main was tough and overdone; the dessert was vile ..</li><li>Lastly, I had the creme caramel for dessert and this was def the best part of the meal.</li><li>The dessert was a very very good carrot cake.</li><li>The next course was the lamb- it was okay but not great and the dessert was a disappointment.</li><li>For dessert, their fried sesame balls are a real treat!</li><li>For dessert, I ordered the Anmitsu ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anmitsu).</li><li>During dessert, a worker came out in a HAZMAT SUIT to begin cleaning the grilling stations.</li><li>The dessert, which I choose the Anmitsu, was disappointing, as it was basically a blob of red bean paste right on top of the little cubes of agar jello.</li><li>Dessert was terrible which hardly to finish.</li><li>For dessert we got the banana crepe ( $ 8) which was flambeed with grand marnier and served with bananas on the side, and strawberries.</li><li>The employees seemed very fresh, as the girl struggled to squeeze the whipped cream onto the plate nicely and the male server I had gave my friend and I a strange look when we said we were just there for dessert.</li><li>But not the dessert.</li><li>For dessert, I had a brownie cake that was definitely worth it for the price and our bills were pretty low all together.</li><li>The only one that seemed promising was the Symposium and the list of dessert and coffee sounded good.</li><li>The dessert we ordered was way beyond sweet, took one bite and I was done.</li><li>Great new spot in my hood with such warm ambiance great for families or friends for dinner, coffee, dessert or all of the above.</li><li>Great dessert and coffee.</li><li>The last serving of food put on our table was around 11:30pm or midnight, after which you have dessert, fruit and coffee.</li><li>I should have probably read the reviews on yelp before going to the restaurant .. but I did n't .. .. btw before i get started why is there filtered reviews ? maybe i missed something ..; anyways went here for lunch with a co-worker because its close to the office .. the decor is okay and we were quickly seated but thats as good as it got .. none of the staff make eye contact, everything is slow even tho the establishment was n't busy, there was just no importance on quality .. we ordered one of the lunch specials, the pricing is good, but I learned a long time ago, you get what you pay for, so for $ 7 to $ 15 you can get a salad, appetizer, sushi, chicken/beef, dessert, etc the food was cold and really average, they forgot our sushi and when we pointed it out to the manager he said he would take it off our bill .. a whole $ 1.20 ?? for 6 sushi rolls .. like i said u get what u pay for .. my co-worker, who is from hong kong blasted the manager, but he was no help ... so i will never go back .. but the experience got me back to using yelp!;).</li><li>And the dessert took them another hr .. really did they need to make the ice cream from scratch and turn it or something.</li><li>For dessert I had the crème caramel ( $ 2.55) and it was a disappointment.</li><li>For dessert we had Cherries Jubilee, which was also made tableside.</li><li>We also wanted to have a grand marnier and coffee for dessert in the bar on the main floor and there were children that were propped up on our knees on bar stools, hunchng over the bar.</li><li>The venue has a classy vintage feel with ample parking. the setting is very nice, calamari was chewy, steak was overcooked, service was slow and unprofessional, dessert was great. would not return.</li><li>Clearly irritated, he politely comments that he was in the middle of his dessert and therefore not quite ready to pay, the server goes off about how they need to close out the cash by 3:30.</li><li>About the time when we were getting dessert, ( and I 'm not one to normally cause a scene) I had to call ( more like below) out to someone to ask if anyone works there.</li><li>Recommend the chicken wings, custard buns; for dessert, try their coconut taro with red bean and almond tofu and juice bomb toppings; make-it-yourself slushie station is popular amongst kids although adults like myself were tempted to help ourselves to a serving as well Chocolate fountain is quite impressive but more selection of fruits that are less sweet would be a nice touch-strawberries and banana for example Overall good experience-would come again.</li><li>I filled two bowls for one meal which came out to one bowl at the end, The guy working the grill was friendly and fast, The buffet was great, lots of options, I loved the shau mai ( which I know I did n't spell correctly) and the lotus seed bun as well as the fried goyza ( again another spelling mistake;)) The dessert was nearly the best part of the entire meal, there was a lot of options and the slush machine and chocolate fountain had to be my favriote.</li><li>Dessert is okay ... my boyfriend loves the cotton candy ice cream.</li><li>We finished with an average dessert and I left with a 4/5 experience.</li><li>The dessert was mango cake.</li><li>So on several occasions, they 've chosen the cheapest, most unflattering dessert for their patrons ... all of which I 've eaten a bite off and had enough.</li><li>Also green giant vegetables. e) All you can eat dessert &amp; coffee/tea Dessert was the only thing that was great.</li><li>The food was okay up until the dessert, which is what they are supposedly famous for.</li><li>The dessert especially is out of the world.</li><li>We ordered from the fixed price menu- I ordered the minestrone soup, The Meat Amore pizza, and tiramisu for dessert.</li><li>My girlfriend ordered the Caesar Salad, the tilapia and chocolate cake for dessert.</li><li>The waiter just left the bill on our table when he served us the dessert ... that ' s really odd in a restaurant .... we felt like he was trying to get rid of us ?!</li><li>I ordered the Arugula salad, Mediterranean Pizza and had the Tiramisu for dessert.</li><li>At the end, we got this wet pastry ball for dessert, which was free.</li><li>For dessert, do n't overlook the small ice cream freezer opposite the buffet table!</li><li>For dessert, the kids ordered for kulfi- it was anything but.</li><li>For dessert try their mango lassi and fried sweet balls ( gulab jamun).</li><li>So the manager comes an said sorry its cuz we used real bread and he still charged us for the dessert.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
