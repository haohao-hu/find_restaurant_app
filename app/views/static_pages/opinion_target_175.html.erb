<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 175' %><h2>Sugar<br />occurrence: 29</h2><div><ol><li>I 've visited ' The Sugar' four times over the past few years, most recently today for lunch.</li><li>Thanks for the good times, The Sugar, but this is a breakup.</li><li>The Sugar is a weird place with a weird array of menu items.</li><li>The Sugar was the 2nd restaurant we hit, right after Congee Wong ( next door).</li><li>The Sugar is the only choice for Chinese dessert in the area so if you in the area and want to satisfy your Chinese desserts craving you kind of stuck with it.</li><li>Best mixed coffee is Vanilla Bean Latte with soy and half the sugar.</li><li>Hated the fountain drinks ... sugar overload.</li><li>That 's called abuse, basically $ 5 for sugar and water.</li><li>The rice is fresh and moist with the correct flavouring combination of sugar and wine.</li><li>The service was super fast, two people ahead of me, waited 3 minutes and as I was deciding if I wanted less ice and sugar, they already started my drink, as soon as I said less sugar, less ice, all the ingredients are thrown into the mixer, and made.</li><li>I often ask for extra sugar in some drinks and I know certain employees that will honour it while other 's will say `` this drink is not available with extra sugar''.</li><li>My go-to drink is the grass jelly roasted milk tea with 20% sugar.</li><li>- I always order 30% sugar- no ice ( you get more tea duh) If you must ask for another good bubble tea place it has to be Ten Ren and ONLY the Highway 7 location in Markham.</li><li>My favorite part is that you can regulate the ice and the sugar.</li><li>I sometimes go as far as getting 30% sugar.</li><li>I always order the grass jelly milk tea with pearls, no ice and 30% sugar!</li><li>I usually order a lychee green tea with grass jelly, 50% sugar, less ice, medium.</li><li>The flavours taste natural, not overly sweet and I love that you can customize your sugar and ice levels.</li><li>I ordered the Strawberry milk tea with less ice and less sugar.</li><li>We always get less ice and find that 50% sugar is plenty sweet enough, and in some cases ( strawberry milk tea) still too sweet.</li><li>I love that you can customize the sugar and ice to suit your taste.</li><li>If it means extra sugar then by all means put extra sugar.</li><li>The Marche is a great place to give into your sweet tooth and enjoy sugar and spice, everything fattening but yummy and nice!</li><li>We ordered their fried egg white puffs, they have sugar sprinkled on top and there is about a 10-20min wait for them.</li><li>You also have the option of half-watered down versions, if you prefer to have less sugar.</li><li>Spices like cumin, pepper, chili flakes, onion oil, all have their place here but the sugar was so pronounced I felt like I was eating candied rice pudding.</li><li>Cherries flambeed with butter and sugar, then poured overtop a scoop of ice cream.</li><li>Seemed to be a very popular place for their cakes, especial popular amongst the older Asian ladies who tend to favor cakes with less sugar.</li><li>Once upon a time over 15 years ago their blueberry meringue cake was famous and to-die-for because quantity and quality were generous and they did not skimp on size, cream, butter, sugar, fruit, portion balance, etc.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
