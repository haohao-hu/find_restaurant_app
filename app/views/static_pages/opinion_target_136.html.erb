<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 136' %><h2>shrimp<br />occurrence: 39</h2><div><ol><li>The shrimp they use is slightly larger than what 's used at some other places.</li><li>The shrimp was really fresh!</li><li>If your looking for something fancy go somewhere else but if u want Chinese food and all u can eat then sure go here ... the shrimp is good but the lemon chicken is kinda funky.</li><li>The color was kind of off- all sashimi had a warm taste and it was covered in water- it just did n't taste pleasant, we ordered a second round of sashimi .. same thing Rolls- Our roll order was forgotten on the FIRST ticket .. mmm .. we ordered their signature roll .. it was really meh .... and the nori was chewy handroll- the Nori was very soft when it came ... portion of rice to filling .. rice more .. filling a bit .. no good Hot Food- beef roll enoki, and green onions, short ribs, grilled shrimp, grilled cutlet, grilled mushroom, grilled beef, grilled chicken heart, etc etc ( The shrimp did not taste fresh again) but overall the beef were all pretty good! ( or 2nd order some of the grill items were once again forgotten !!!! they were n't even full for the evening !!)</li><li>The tempura came out quick except for the shrimp, which took two additional orders until it finally came out.</li><li>This place knows how to deep fry properly as all the tempura came out crunchy, shrimp was the frozen kind ( mushy texture).</li><li>In terms of what we ordered: Mussels- excellent Chicken souvlaki- great Prime rib- no good, dont order this Garlic bread- excellent Steak and shrimp fajitas- steak not so good, shrimp was excellent Seems like they are n't too good with their beef, but everything else was great.</li><li>The Shrimp was so battered up and oily that I did n't even finish the one I took to try.</li><li>It was tasteless and shrimp were overcooked.</li><li>The noodles, tempura ( veggies only, the shrimp was meh), beef and rock shrimp were the highlights.</li><li>I had a quail egg ( tasted canned), a wonton ( lots of shrimp and pork filling, I wished there was more than just 1), a shrimp ( a good size, but not completely de-veined), 2 pieces of squid ( tasted rubbery), a piece of BBQ pork ( good flavour and not too fatty), 2 pieces of thinly sliced liver ( I do n't usually like liver, but this was ok), 2 pieces of thinly sliced heart ( I gave this to my dad because other than liver I do n't eat organ meats), and a fried fish ball sliced in two ( tasted good).</li><li>She said the shrimp tasted soft and mushy and not fresh and the pancake was greasy.</li><li>Also, the shrimp were perfectly butterflied and cooked.</li><li>Besides the pork cutlet on rice, the shrimp and potato salad is also my mom 's favorite.</li><li>My aunt ordered the Seafood Creole ( $ 16)- shrimp, calamari, clams, salmon, mussels, linguine pasta, and a marinara sauce.</li><li>I thought we 're having Italian), my mom ordered it and it was n't bad + SHRIMP ARRABBIATTA, sister ordered it and it was n't bad either + VEAL PARMESAN, because I wanted something covered in tomato sauce and it was good too ... but I 've tasted better. + broski had the LASAGNA, and it was alright too. + daddyo had the GRILLED VEAL TENDERLOIN, yeah this one was actually really good.</li><li>I have been here many times before, and some of my favourite pastas are the following,- linguine clams pasta- shrimp Portabello pasta I wish their waiters would smile a little.</li><li>Our son ordered the Fritta mista di mare, lightly breaded and fried mixture of large shrimp, calamari, and cuttlefish.</li><li>The calamari was tender, cuttlefish was light and tasty, shrimp were huge and scallops were cooked to perfection.</li><li>We had lobster bisque, papaya salad, giant shrimp, beef brisket in curry, soft shell crab, plus several more dishes.</li><li>Seafood udon had next to no seafood ( we found half a shrimp ?).</li><li>We had dried oyster, vegetable and lean pork congee ( CAD $ 5.25), fish congee ( CAD $ 4.99), roasted duck and BBQ pork with honey combo ( CAD $ 9.75), Chu-Hau beef brisket ( CAD $ 4.95), stir-fried sticky rice ( CAD $ 5.99), deep-fried crab claws ( CAD $ 5.75), deep-fried shrimp wontons ( CAD $ 5.25), and my be-loved deep-fried sweet cruller ( CAD $ 1.60).</li><li>There were a ton of chicken, scallops, shrimp, squid, green peppers, and more.</li><li>Not as good a selection as downtown Dim Sum places and our steam shrimp balls were undercooked- the shrimp inside was cold and still grey.</li><li>The salad was good and the shrimp were delicious.</li><li>Now I would never complain about that ratio ... but here 's the kicker ( s): The breaded strips of chicken had a very odd, smoky flavour which after a hesitant second bite, revealed itself to be a strip of bacon wrapped around the chicken ( um, Jewish neighbourhood and no mention of it on the menu), the two chicken wings had a distinctive metallic flavour, the pork ribs were terribly chewy and dry, the shrimp had a mealy, thick dough around them that was n't even fully cooked through and had a terrible, raw-fish smell and taste that lingered in my mouth for an hour afterward and the chicken balls were ok.</li><li>It was filled with lots of the requisite bean sprouts and pork, but they were pretty light on the shrimp: one, possibly two pieces of shrimp.</li><li>Compared to other ones I have had in the past, the shrimp cracker was bigger and you have the option of ordering the soup with the noodle or on the side.</li><li>The shrimp was fresh and crispy!</li><li>Ordered the Combination Soon Tofu ( Beef, shrimp, mussels) with medium spicy.</li><li>The soup had mussels, shrimp, tofu, and cabbage.</li><li>They have whole wheat, I tried the vegetarian, as they were out of fish and the shrimp looked suspect.</li><li>I had the Suyatem Plate ( $ 28), which came w/ assorted nigiri sushi ( few pieces of raw sushi, 2 rolls), assorted tempera ( shrimp, zucchini, yam), chicken yakitori.</li><li>The shrimp were just OK.</li><li>Then there is the MONGOLIAN BBQ part- starting with proteins, you get a choice of chicken, lamb, beef, shrimp, calamari, tofu- there is lots to choose from for everybody.</li><li>The congee was good, lots of seafood variety with salmon, shrimp, crab etc. the cantonese chow mein was mediocre, it 's my brothers fave so we end up ordering that but I felt the noodles were too crispy for my liking.</li><li>The shrimp was disgusting!</li><li>Jumbo Prawn Masala- plump, juicy shrimp in a savoury gravy.</li><li>Besides the naan and shrimp were okay.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
