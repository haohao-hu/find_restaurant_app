<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 195' %><h2>wrap<br />occurrence: 26</h2><div><ol><li>I think they used naan bread as the wrap, which was a little stiff and it was dry in the outside and drenched with sauce on the inside.</li><li>The wrap, I was told, was fantastic.</li><li>I upgraded my wrap to a combo with salad and pop. It came to a little over $ 10.</li><li>The chicken in the wrap was not moist, and seemed quite dry.</li><li>So yeah, McD Ingram, the wrap would have been better with the T in it.</li><li>Cause the wrap tasted great.</li><li>The Fried Duck was also very moist and crisp, and a together with the wrap, celery, hoi sin sauce provided a multi-faceted alternative to the other mildly spicy dishes.</li><li>They gave me a soggy wrap.</li><li>Secondly, I 'm surprised there are no ssam ( veggie wrap, usually lettuce).</li><li>The wrap for the duck was good but the cucumber and onion looked like it was prepped days ago and just kept in the fridge.</li><li>Next, the wrap was n't warm to my liking, there was inconsistency in that.</li><li>I would also say the wrap is about a medium level of spicyness so I like to add extra hot sauce, albeit I am a hot sauce fiend.</li><li>I ordered the pruscito piadina- it 's essentially a wrap filled with salty prosciutto, arugula, mozzarella, garlic aloli, and some type of balsamic reduction.</li><li>The wrap was good.</li><li>The wrap was soaked in clear liquid so it was soggy, and the sauce was pouring out of it making it not just bad tasting but also messy so I gave up.</li><li>The wrap is thin, filing is delicious and steam to its perfection.</li><li>I was n't impressed that the saran wrap was loosely wrapped and falling apart.</li><li>Mmmm ... lunch was over 4 hours ago and I still ca n't get over how good my wrap was.</li><li>The wrap was perfectly grilled and had a nice toasty flavour.</li><li>I do n't think I would come back to spend over $ 13 for a plate of semi-warm wrap and fruit that 's been left out for too long.</li><li>The wrap was fresh and has a chewy texture that I love.</li><li>I have always gotten the wrap to share with someone because it was so big I could barely finish half but this time I was not remotely satisfied.</li><li>We were quite disappointed because we are spending $ 10 on a wrap and when we got the wrap the first few bites were all bread.</li><li>Another time we had the falafal balls and the side of tahini sauce was missing and another time a couple toppings were missing from our wrap.</li><li>Note to anyone who gets the Grilled veggies as a side or in the wrap.</li><li>Personally I do n't like a lot of oil on my vegetables so I ask for them to go easy on the oil However, I do enjoy the food here a lot and would recommend it but make sure you get your wrap to your liking and ask for additional toppings if desired.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
