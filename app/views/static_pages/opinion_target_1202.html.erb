<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1202' %><h2>owner lady<br />occurrence: 3</h2><div><ol><li>Do n't even know if we could go on our road trip today just because of this meal. visited on tuesday night around 7pm for dinner. the place was packed and noisy. there were only 2 servers + owner lady ? so the service was very slow ( especially they have to cook the food for u at the table). they were so busy and my order was confused but she apologized politely right away so we just ate our meal w/out complain. but i still prefer the downtown location. their food &amp; service is better. and its really hot in the inner part of the restaurant.</li><li>The owner lady did n't even apologize!</li><li>The owner lady was not even apologetic about our service, and made a stink that we did n't leave them tips.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
