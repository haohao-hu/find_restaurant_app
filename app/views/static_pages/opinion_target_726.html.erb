<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 726' %><h2>dip<br />occurrence: 5</h2><div><ol><li>The portion was so small that if you used 20% of the amount of chips it came with to dip, the dip would finish.</li><li>The dip was too spicy for my fiancee so she asked our server if they had any other options for dipping sauce and he said no they did n't.</li><li>Dip sauces are all sweet; the mango yogurt dip tastes too much like dessert- one savoury dip would be a good idea, perhaps a spicy ( curry ?) aoli.</li><li>Their hummus is good and tasty, I 've had much better babaganoush ( Famous Laffa) but it was n't bad and the third dip was eggplant in some sort of tomato based sauce.</li><li>Wings- Wings come in 1 lb or 2 lb and are generally tasty, can be dry sometimes but it does n't matter because the dip tastes so good with the wings.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
