<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 6984' %><h2>bacon meal<br />occurrence: 1</h2><div><ol><li>Symposim is a lot like the caf√© mirage.symposium is a great place for breakfast but let me warn you they have so much trouble in the accuracy of my order I almost do n't wanna go back.Even though I like their breakfast/Brunch.I do n't recommend Going at dinner or lunch because the food slides down.doiring dinner and sometimes lunch everyday they have specials that have not very good food for a decent price.Their accuracy is bad I ordered a kids menu for my nephew and here 's what happens he ordered eggs and bacon meal which came with potato, eggs, bread and bacon and a drink and a desert My nephew said over easy they made it overheard there was no bacon on the plate and when my niece ordered a `` freshly squeezed juice'' it was bitter and had chunks or orange peal not even zest !!</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
