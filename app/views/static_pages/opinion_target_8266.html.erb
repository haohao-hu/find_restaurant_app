<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 8266' %><h2>bun mam<br />occurrence: 1</h2><div><ol><li>They did this with all employees, so customers beware! portions here are really generous. the workers and waitresses are also really nice. for the people who are complaining about how the workers are ( ie rolliing the dirty dishes around etc) ... thats typically a normal vietnamese resturant for you. if u think this is dirty then u should not go to vietnam lol. but anywho, food here is really good. my parents go here every other day or so cos its close to their work and i also know a friend who eats here everyday too just cause he loves it. the pho, rice, and bun mam is really yummy. also my aunt is obssessed with their viet coffee as she says its authentic since there is so much flavour! also really cheap too:) oh yeah its cash only ... i think by now its safe to say if u go anywhere asian, just have cash with u cos chances are they are not going to take debit or credit!</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
