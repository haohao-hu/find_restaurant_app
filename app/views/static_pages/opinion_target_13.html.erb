<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 13' %><h2>decor<br />occurrence: 521</h2><div><ol><li>You will also get a kick out of the kitchy interior decor and the art that hangs on the walls ( most items are for sale).</li><li>I would give the food 5 stars but I 'm bringing my rating down to 3 stars because I thought it was expensive when you factor in the portion sizes and the fact that the decor is kind of ghetto.</li><li>I 've been to some really nice Indian places downtown that have the exact same pricing but much nicer decor and slightly bigger portions.</li><li>WIll not however win any awards for it 's decor!</li><li>It is a small, fast food Asian style eatery that is free of potentious decor or service but is pretty good at what it does.</li><li>The decor and ambience is decent, nothing fancy for this mom/pop shop.</li><li>The decor may need an update, but I come for the food.</li><li>New decor.</li><li>The decor is not anything close to what they had in the Mississauga branch.</li><li>It deserves 5 stars for several reasons: 1) The decor is very Chinese, and youthful, and hip, I like what they did for Chinese new year 2012 2) The menu has been redesigned.</li><li>My friend and I ordered- steamed xo sauce pork neck rice: a little bland, and came with a bowl of cooked lettuce in soy sauce ...- stinky hot pot: really good, with intestines, pigs blood, enokie mushrooms, fish balls, and fish cake- mixed vegetables and tofu dry pot: it was okay- herbal essence jelly in coconut milk: awesome- mango freeze: she said it was awesome The decor is nice, the service is unfriendly.</li><li>Decor nice, food so very, very disappointing.</li><li>Their prices are fine and the decor is limited.</li><li>Place was okay, clean decor.</li><li>They have changed their decor since a couple of months ago and the place looks a little better than before.</li><li>The decor is modern, but comfortable.</li><li>Decor and interior is modern and very `` standard'' asian-fushiony.</li><li>Lovely decor, comfortable seating, great for groups ( remember to make a reservation if you 're going at lunch time, this place gets busy)!</li><li>Interesting, but I 'm not sure whether to be impressed by bathroom-hallway decor or mystified as to how a wannabe ROM display ended up at Yonge and Sheppard.</li><li>CAFE:- no cafe menu, only one type of coffee ( I never order it, so I do n't know what it is)- there 's no wifi, no need to fight for power outlets ... since there are n't any,:)- the lounge tables are super spacious and comfy, tables are large, great for all sorts of work, from textbooks, tax forms, to picture gallery work- mostly quiet environment, unless we 're talking busy meal times RESTO:- yes, decor 's a little ' unique', think rustic cottage- washroom 's a little cramped- they regularly accommodate for large tables, work with you to come up with a customized menu- large room in the back if you want privacy as well- food is done well.</li><li>So I 'm not bothered by the decor, nor do I stay long enough to use the washrooms, so this place works great for me, but only because I take it for what it is.</li><li>One interesting thing is that the decor is that of a Southern smoke house, as that is what this lot used to be.</li><li>Just have to ignore the tacky decor and you will love it.</li><li>By the way, take out is all you would want to do here, as there is no ambiance, and the decor feels like the 1970s.</li><li>The decor is old school library full of single malt scotch.</li><li>The decor is faded and warn and the entire place needed to be hosed down.</li><li>The decor is very old and faded; paint peels and flakes off the walls and chairs, the floor is stained, and the place seems a few years away from being abandoned.</li><li>The restaurant does n't have the fanciest decor but the food is exceptional.</li><li>The place looks like it could 've been upscale back in the 80 's but is seriously flawed in it 's decor.</li><li>The cleanliness and decor .... wom woM woOoOom!</li><li>Do n't be put off by the 60 's decor and the ridiculous name `` mr combo'', no asian food here, just excellent eastern euorpean and middle eastern- falafel, schnitzel, soups and great desserts.</li><li>The decor is very nice and the service is awesome.</li><li>Nice interior and decor.</li><li>The decor, atmosphere and service was very good.</li><li>The decor is chic and modern, that 's about it.</li><li>The decor is beautiful!</li><li>Decor is decent.</li><li>Brand new decor.</li><li>Decor: Nice modern interior that looks more like a wine bar or lounge.</li><li>The restaurant looks absolutely amazing, classy decor, trendy vibe and really friendly and helpful staff.</li><li>The atmosphere and decor here is really nice and modern.</li><li>Nice, modern decor, creative presentation.</li><li>Great open kitchen decor and ambience in the restaurant.</li><li>Was first introduced to Sushi Moto a couple of years back and am impressed by the quality of the food, excellent service and beautiful decor.</li><li>Pricing is a little higher than the area competition but the above mentioned quality of food, service and decor, justify the higher prices.</li><li>Decor is quite modern.</li><li>The food has always been good, the presentation on point, and the decor and service has always been good.</li><li>The atmosphere is great, with an abundance of tv 's and great decor.</li><li>I like the decor in this place.</li><li>The decor is slick and more downtown than North York.</li><li>The decor is very nice.</li><li>One time they forgot the water and I had to ask someone else so that 's why I give it 4/5 but other than that good place! we stopped by for lunch today. the decor looked fancy, i like the environment. the price tag is a bit on the expensive side. you 're looking at 20-30 dollars easy per person. i do like their quality of food. we had some salmon and tuna nigiris and they were pretty fresh! the staff there are attentive. cute place! although this place was suggested by my cousin ( because his friend owns the place), i was unimpressed by their sushi/sashimi. it was n't fresh! yes, the place is nice, trendy and huge, but i would n't go here for their sushi.</li><li>This is what North York has been missing .... a place to hang out that 's not an old runned down bar, but instead fashioned with modern and comfortable decor.</li><li>Classy and sleek decor.</li><li>The service was so-so, the food took too long but the decor is nice I guess.</li><li>This place distinguishes itself from the many Japanese restaurants in the area by having a large, open space and understated dark colours as decor.</li><li>The decor is very modern.</li><li>The decor quite good and relaxing.</li><li>The atmosphere is trendy and upscale, I like the wooden decor and bar tables.</li><li>Decor is nice, and prices are high to match.</li><li>As much as I liked the decor and the expensive looking dinnerware, I did n't care for the disposable chopsticks.</li><li>5/5 consistency is super, i have been here a few times with similarly good experiences 3/5 prices are high, not quite sky high though .. but I guess this place deserves it, despite the costco seaweed salad being like 7 $ !!!!! 5/5 decor is quite nice, clean, stylish, and just a great place to be not much downside going here, just have to save up before you can afford it though.</li><li>The decor is very classy, and sophisticated.</li><li>Decor is nice.</li><li>Decor is modern-looking.</li><li>4 stars for decor, 3 for food.</li><li>The decor is proper.</li><li>It is also a good place to meet someone as the environment and decor is pretty nice.</li><li>Love the decor, trendy ambiance.</li><li>The food, decor and service are all top notch.</li><li>Modern decor.</li><li>I 've been to this place a few times and like the food/ decor.</li><li>The decor is a bit of an eyesore.</li><li>This is an old-school diner with friendly owners with a uniquely quirky decor ( lots of tiles in places you might not expect).</li><li>Very home-like feel including the decor, cutlery, etc.</li><li>I love the understated vibe of both the food and the decor.</li><li>I think the food is delightful but the decor is ... well ... yard-sale.</li><li>The decor was mostly vintage, there were pictures on the wall of the celebrities that came by, and the lighting was extremely dim.</li><li>The decor is fine, and they have a bunch of Sean Paul autographed pictures on the wall which is kind of neat.</li><li>While the decor and ambience is pleasant, the prices are not indicative of the quality of the food.</li><li>Interesting decor.</li><li>Ugly decor!</li><li>Prices are reasonable and while the decor is n't anything fancy, the place has a comfortable family feel.</li><li>The decor and ambiance is not classy, but it 's not the worst.</li><li>Whoa, really dated decor ...</li><li>Going to this place is like diving into a time warp- faded decor, stale carpets, cane &amp; walker dependent clientele.</li><li>The decor is a bit dated ( Equine-Windfield Farms ??), but the place is super clean and inviting.</li><li>Decor looks like its from the 70 's but its very well maintained.</li><li>The decor is adorable, simple and comfortable.</li><li>The decor of this restaurant is modern and clean which gave a good impression.</li><li>Nice decor, friendly staff.</li><li>The decor is light and airy with large windows.</li><li>Wonderful Decor- with tiered flooring.</li><li>Love the decor but can`t say the same for the food.</li><li>I agree with Andrew Y that the place gets a little credit for interesting decor.</li><li>The only reason it gets 4 stars is because decor is n't awesome ( not bad either) and the price is a bit high.</li><li>The decor inside is nice and simple, but modern.</li><li>The decor is much nicer than Wonderpho and if the food is quite similar why not go to the better looking restaurant.</li><li>The decor is themed around ' nothing', which is a new contemporary going around like wildfire throughout restaurants in China located in any given hole in whatever wall which exists locally, the plastic sheet tablecloth adds an air of authenticity, in fact, I was impressed by this place even having lights which work, I appreciate that special ... je ne c' est quoi, they really did n't need to go this far, as I am used to much less.</li><li>Kind of becomes a part of the decor.</li><li>This place feels more like a home kitchen and the decor was average, not like Asian Legend.</li><li>To be clear, I am perfectly okay with basic service decor at Chinese restaurants, if I know it 's excellent food and well priced.</li><li>THE BAD: Decor.</li><li>They keep the cost down by focusing on fresh food rather than decor and models in mini-skirts ( yes I 'm talking about Joey '' s restaurants).</li><li>My issue is n't with the decor or staff, but with God awful drink I had to awkwardly sip during my time there.</li><li>Love the wooden decor, plants placement and booth seats where friends can just chat and catch up and forget about the time.</li><li>The decor is cute and dainty, food is not up to par though.</li><li>The decor is very cute and cozy.</li><li>1. cool space. the decor is interesting, and the whole space has dividers so there is quite a bit of privacy.</li><li>The interior decor looked nice but the restaurant was very hot.</li><li>The decor is nice and bright, and it 's split into individual booths ( sometimes shared), which makes it a pretty good place to study in my opinion.</li><li>5 stars for food 2 stars decor 4 star service ( almost none existence.</li><li>Decor is minimal.</li><li>Decor and cleanliness was that of a typical pho restaurant.</li><li>Nice restaurant with an interesting decor.</li><li>The strangest part of the visit was that the decor was hardcore Greek, but the staff ( and possibly owners too) are Korean or Chinese.</li><li>Pricing is decent and I actually like the decor.</li><li>They have put a lot into the decor.</li><li>Service was friendly and I did like the decor and the way the room was broken up.</li><li>The decor was something out of the 50 's ... not hip.</li><li>Decor: Elegant and a bit modern Food: They like to use catch phrases like `` organic'' and `` local'' which is more of a marketing scheme for me, but the food was good.</li><li>The decor is outdated.</li><li>The decor looked a bit outdated but it was relaxing.</li><li>The decor was modern and classy with reasonable prices.</li><li>However, do n't let the decor fool you.</li><li>GREAT place .... the ideal local tavern ... yet more than a tavern ... food is fabulous ... decor is nice ... great outdoor patios in nice weather ... a big improvement over the original `` Jolly Miller'' !!</li><li>The decor, fit and finish and feel and ambiance of the restaurant was nice.</li><li>The decor is typical Japanese style but with a lot of private space, each table is separated and there 's no noisy music so that you can have conversations, or enjoy lunch/diner by yourself like I did:).</li><li>First of all, decor ...</li><li>The decor is cute and clean.</li><li>Decor is like a typical, quaint, Japanese restaurant.</li><li>I really like the traditional decor and the service.</li><li>Over all a good dining experience though the decor could use some updating.</li><li>I like the decor- feels authentic. not the music though. every time we get there it 's a collection of oldies ... still listenable ... but why not japanese classical music ? anyway. none of my friends every complained about the food. they only have one veg bento box on lunch special but it 's pretty good and very filling. tea + miso soup + orange at the end = included. they also introduced discount cards- collect 4 lunch stamps and get 5th one with 13% discount. collect 9 and get 10th with $ 10 discount. sounds as a good idea. the lunches end up costing around $ 12 with tax + tip.</li><li>It does n't have as much playful/colorful theme decor as Popeyes but still has enough to know that this is a Fried Chicken place.</li><li>If you 're willing to overlook some questionable hygiene and outdated decor for some great food, Orly 's would be recommended without reservation.</li><li>Ambience: 3/5, more of an Asian feel of decor; perhaps because it 's in North York Price: 3/5, fair and great service deserved a big tip.</li><li>I see the booths, the deep, dark decor reminiscint of a cigar room for proper men.</li><li>This was my first time coming to this location, and it 's pretty similar to their other locations in terms of service and decor.</li><li>The decor itself could use some updating, but it kind of passes under the radar as most are glued to the TV with ethnic programming.</li><li>The 70 's decor was way cool and I wanted to see if the cola bottle machine worked ..</li><li>Sashimi boat- Each piece was thick and evenly sliced Service Great staff Decor There are individual rooms with curtains or tables in the main dining area.</li><li>The atmosphere is more old school Japanese restaurant vibe rather than hip and modern Chinese sushi shop decor like at downtown-ish locales.</li><li>Yes, the decor leaves much to be desired but the staff are friendly, if not a tad on the slow side service-wise.</li><li>The decor is miles away from the super expensive chic boutique type restaurants.</li><li>Decor 4.0/5- It feels very homely here ... like you 're eating out of their dining room.</li><li>The place has interesting homey decor.</li><li>The decor is relatively standard for a japanese/korean restaurant.</li><li>Stumbling inside after hungrily searching for the place, we immediately noticed the quirky decor- fake fireplace, xmas tree in August, generic Asian kitsch.</li><li>The decor is lacking but hey ..</li><li>From the upscale outside look and decor you expect a quality dining experience, but that 's not really what you get.</li><li>Decor is basic ... nothing fancy in this place.</li><li>Almost every fish and chip place seems to be about the same in decor and style.</li><li>The decor is nothing fancy so dont be surprised on your first time coming in but the food more than makes up for it.</li><li>The decor is outdated but the food hit the spot!</li><li>It is a great asset to the Don Mills area, selling delicious food for good prices while not relying on pretentious decor or hosts.</li><li>Do not expect much in terms of decor, ambiance, etc.</li><li>While the decor may not be appealing, the food is a different take.</li><li>The decor is n't much to look at as it is your typical divey-chinese restaurant.</li><li>The decor is very classic italian, rustic furniture, backdrop of Italian murals, statue, and red/white checkered table cloths ....</li><li>I will definitely be coming back here !!! arviderci Paolo see you soon! this is a really cute place close to my neighborhood, my boyf and i decided to come here after i read some good yelp reviews ( id seen the place before but never got around to actually trying it). the service was so friendly and he gave us 2 coffees for the price of one which was very sweet. i love the decor and music, its very old-timey. i ordered a chicken sandwich and he ordered an eggplant sandwich, which is vegetarian, and they were really good, my only gripe would be that the bread is a bit dry. otherwise its a really nice little place with reasonable prices.</li><li>Decor: Minimal decor, washrooms are clean and ample seating.</li><li>Decor: Minimal decor, washrooms are clean and ample seating.</li><li>Bathroom passably clean, lots of fake flowers for decor.</li><li>The decor is not bad dude.</li><li>Atmosphere was pleasant when we walked in; nice decor and not overly noisy.</li><li>3, Decor- It 's a relatively new restaurant and everything still looks brand new 4, Location- It 's very close to me plus free parking right in front of the store, if not around the plaza 5, Price- It 's not the cheapest place you can go to but it 's worth every penny.</li><li>4 stars definitely well deserved. loved this place the last time I went =) Decor 's nice, food 's nice, they did forget some dishes, but it was okay =) Overall really nice service!</li><li>The place itself is relatively new and has a nice modern decor.</li><li>The place itself is rather small and the decor inside resembles a cheesy island restaurant.</li><li>The athmosphere is set by relaxing Asian music; simple and traditional service and decor.</li><li>Probably an old burger joint converted to a Viet restaurant resulting in an odd decor but a familiar restaurant experience.</li><li>You will have to keep an open mind as you step in though as the decor is a little ( ok, VERY) outdated.</li><li>The decor was quite nice, but the lighting was a bit too dark for my taste.</li><li>I was n't expecting much due to the dated decor, but was blown away by the food.</li><li>We love to come here, the food is great steaks and sea food plater are Yuuuummmmmyyyyyyy Yes the decor is somewhat dated, yet the food as mentioned is superb.</li><li>Decor inside is pretty nice and it seems like it 's a popular place for Korean teenagers to hang out, but so did every other place on the street:).</li><li>The decor is not the typical Korean joint, they actually spruced this place up.</li><li>Nice decor and reasonable food.</li><li>The decor was clean and modern with Korean videos playing on a few TVs around the restaurant.</li><li>The pizza slices are good, while the veal sandwiches are better. if you 're eating in, you 'll find the decor dated, but it 's part of the charm.</li><li>The decor was odd.</li><li>This place reminds me so much of all the Hungarian Places that used to be along Bloor in the Annex--the strange decor, the menu with the liquor listed at the end, the staff and the way the place fills up at a drop of a hat.</li><li>The decor could use some updating though I appreciated the charm of the Hungarian style.</li><li>The decor is n't spectacular, but the staff are reasonably kind and the food arrived quickly.</li><li>The place was very clean and the decor was aesthetically very nice.</li><li>Decor is nothing fancy, just a homely Mexican feel.</li><li>The decor is n't anything special, but the food was great!</li><li>Which is always a good sign.:) The decor is hole in the wallish but I had hopes for the food.</li><li>The place has an older decor but it works.</li><li>The decor is that of most typical Chinese restaurant or Cafes and it 's nothing out of the ordinary.</li><li>The place is hard to find it 's in the corner of a dingy plaza and the decor can do with a bit of updating.</li><li>Temper your expectations for decor and ambience and you 'll be pleasantly satisfied!</li><li>The decor looks like it was bought from the tropical section of Party Packagers but the place is clean and the service was very good.</li><li>Walked in and was greeted by Thai sculptures, bamboo poles, fake greenery and blinking Christmas lights for decor.</li><li>This location gets an extra star than what it deserves because of the decor.</li><li>Amazing food, do n't judge by the decor.</li><li>Decor was nice but the place is not the cleanest.</li><li>The menu will give you a bit of sticker shock considering the decor and the amount.</li><li>Ignoring the price and decor the food I had which is the chicken cashew.</li><li>Overall the food was over a four star rating but the decor and price sort of dragged it down.</li><li>I do n't mind it at all but its the complete opposite of say, the Keg, in terms of decor and atmosphere.</li><li>Do n't let the dingy decor fool you.</li><li>So you wo n't be coming here for the decor nor will you be turned away with its shady environment.</li><li>Anyway, the decor here can be described as cold and sterile, with minimal thought placed into the overall ambience, which might be off putting for some.</li><li>Decor is brought to you by IKEA.</li><li>I stayed in store to enjoy my drink and the decor is hip and fresh.</li><li>A clean, modern decor always has a fresh feel to it.</li><li>The decor is also modern, but the bathrooms are hard to find.</li><li>The drinks were yummy and the interior decor was cool and unique.</li><li>The decor is very dated, the lighting is unpleasant, and the crowd largely 70 +.</li><li>- Outdated decor when this place has n't been around t h a t long.</li><li>The decor was quaint and inviting.</li><li>The decor it a bit cheesy with faux Roman sculptures.</li><li>The decor is typical older Italian restaurant, but it seems to always be busy!</li><li>The decor was a bit dated, though spacious, and the clientele was primarily an older crowd with a couple of families and couples.</li><li>The decor is a bit dark and dingy but the food makes up for it.</li><li>The decor was familiar and the service was good but, based on my one-time experience, I can only recommend this place as a watering hole, not a feeding station.</li><li>I do n't think it 's reasonable for any reviewer to dock stars for service or decor.</li><li>The atmosphere and decor are what lifting it to the `` fine'' level.</li><li>Only criticism, place a bit dark and decor a little old fashioned---but judging how full the place was, the patrons do n't seem to mind.</li><li>So an automatic 5 stars for decor.</li><li>The atmosphere was quaint and cosy and had very nice decor.</li><li>My friend and i enjoyed our first experience here. the panang curry was amazing. the flavour and spice was delicious. i got the tofu paneng and she got the beef. the service was extremely friendly at the bar as well as the other servers were very bice too. staff was attentive and courteous and i personally enjoyed the atnsoohere. the lights were too dark, and the decor was appropriate. happy to have had my first experience here be a good one.</li><li>The decor is beautiful and very impressive.</li><li>Decor is quite nice and asian themed of course.</li><li>Love the decor.</li><li>Decor- its kinda weird.</li><li>Ambience: The place does get an A for decor.</li><li>I could see people celebrating a special occasion here for the beautiful decor.</li><li>From the decor to the food this place really knows how to do Thai.</li><li>Good decor though, you can enjoy that while your waiting for your second dish to be brought out because you returned the first for it 's gross taste.</li><li>The restaurant is conveniently located in Shops at Don Mills, and the decor is absolutely beautiful.</li><li>We entered the place, beautiful decor &amp; all, and were told that everything is booked and it would take about 40 minutes to seat us.</li><li>The food, the decor, the service.</li><li>A bit pricy, but the decor, food and service will have to warrant that.</li><li>Was really impressed by the decor and service.</li><li>Love the decor.</li><li>It 's a bit pricey for Thai food, but the ambience is nice, and the overall decor is also lovely.</li><li>The decor is very elegant, featuring a large classic Thai temple centerpiece.</li><li>The decor was lovely, beautiful Thai statues and we got the semi private group table by the bar.</li><li>The curry itself is amazing and not too spicy and the beef is tender on the inside and has a light crispy outside. i ca n't get myself to try any of the other mains! for apps i 've tried their mango salad ( note that there 's coriander in it, which I hate and mint leaves which I also do n't like), beef satay ( not bad), and their fried calamari ( I would get this again and loved the honey chili dipping sauce it came with). desserts I 've tried their mango sticky rice ( the mango was not sweet and really hard) and their deep fried banana with honey ( just standard). the decor here is super cool and there 's a nice patio area for the summer, I love this place!</li><li>Pros: Very nice decor Good Service Cons: Not much variety on the menu Portions could of been better Hidden automatic gratuity ?</li><li>Coming in you notice the beautiful decor that have going.</li><li>We came here for dinner and was greeted by a very friendly waiter:) From first glance, the decor had a really traditional Thai feel but still lived up to the modern in its name.</li><li>Overall the decor was nice if not a bit superfluous, and the waitress was pleasant, but the food was very underwhelming and not worth it.</li><li>The sister restaurant of the famous Salad King on Yonge and Dundas, has opened its doors to the North York crowd featuring traditional Thai dishes in a location that could have not been more perfect, with a decor that could have not been more Thai.</li><li>You pay a large premium for good service and decor but the food is mediocre and small portion.</li><li>Nice decor and good service.</li><li>The decor and ambiance are very classy with Buddhist sculptures and beautiful orchids.</li><li>The decor of this place is beautiful and really fun.</li><li>Ambience &amp; decor: ethnic-modern, classy.</li><li>Nice decor inside.</li><li>The decor is sheek and trendy, and looks like what one would imagine a restuarant in Thailand might actually look like- the upscale, trying-to-be- trendy version, of course.</li><li>Decor like an old Montreal convenience store.</li><li>I dare not look around the kitchen, how the food is handled, or the lack of decor.</li><li>Every Lamb and Beef dish on this picture friendly menu is AWESOME. go in for a warm lamb stew or chef 's special soup in the winter, or cool garlic cucumbers in the summer. their beef or lamb chinese style pancakes are YUM -- delightfully puffy and filled with perfectly seasoned meat. their house special beef noodle soup is cravable! you can taste the time and love in the soup base. ughh so goooood .. and the hand pulled noodles are as real as they get outside of la chine. seriously ? who cooks like this anymore outside of china ? -- these are classic techniques! the decor is kind of hilarious though, a lil step up from a hole in the wall, it 's definitely clean, but it also feels like you 're in the middle of nowhere china, really really first gen. like you 've escaped the city. and nothing matches. the walls are cheerily painted like you 're walking into the plateaus deep into china, starkly contrasting the leather booths and the crazy yellow seat covers that match the trilingual waitress 's outfits ( they mainly speak mandarin, some canto, and english). the TVs are always playing old 50 's chinese black &amp; white talkies, and there are neon signs boasting great halel food! the chef is usually out and about greeting the customers- he 's won awards for his food, and i agree -- this place is seriously the best regional lamb and beef dishes that 's hit the east side of this city since ... johnny 's burgers. i highly recommend this place! because i 'd be so sad to see it go under because no one knows about it. deserves my YUM YUM approval fo sheezie;).</li><li>The space itself has been home to three prior restaurants that has all gone out of business, the height of the chairs make you wish you 've brought a phone book to sit on so that you have the right chair-to-table elevation, and the decor makes as much sense as the leaders the Liberal Party picks to run their campaign.</li><li>A place like this, you would n't be expecting top notch decor/ service.</li><li>Decor: the words suburban communist china come to mind, well intentioned chinese kitsch Our group ordered a host of dishes that could really be described as a lamb-a-palooza, lamb, lamb and more lamb with vegetables making a minor guest appearance.</li><li>Decor, space, and service were all amazing BUT the food was n't ( mind you this is dependent if you fancy Mongolian cuisine) I surprisingly found the curry fish to taste scrumptious but other items such as friend potato and noodles to be bland and in some cases very oily I would recommend this for someone craving traditional Chinese cuisine but if you are like me who enjoy Hakka style more I would avoid this place.</li><li>The restaurant itself is nice looking, with some Arabic/Chinese calligraphy on the walls and new-enough decor.</li><li>Decor: Nothing fancy.</li><li>Nice decor and place was well cleaned.</li><li>I ca n't rate on service or decor, as service is pretty non-existent.</li><li>This is a sit-down restaurant with dated decor.</li><li>Note: the decor is `` homey'', not `` fancy'': plastic covers over table cloths and vinyl covered metal frame chairs.</li><li>The owner is Syrian, of the original Armenian owner what is left is the name and few decor item.</li><li>Decor is a bit outdated, but it 's clean.</li><li>I do not recommend the Schwarma sandwiches here ( they put very minimal toppings in the sandwiches) or going for the decor.</li><li>You definitely do n't come for the Decor but the food is authentic and prepared with care and all round awesome!</li><li>The restaurant decor has n't changed in years, but the staff are great and always have a wonderful time !!</li><li>Also, the decor is really old and traditional.</li><li>It 's an unassuming place to say the least, located in a strip mall on a block of strip malls and apartment buildings on Victoria Park, it has a small sign and very understated and dated decor.</li><li>The decor has n't really changed in the past 15 years, it could use a bit of updating, however the food is what brings you here.</li><li>The decor is pretty traditional and the place is kind of dark ... but not dirty or anything.</li><li>The decor is nothing fancy and the idea is that you do n't spend a tremendous amount of time there.</li><li>Upon arrival the decor is very dated and tacky, everything looked dusty and unkempt but they had just opened for service so we decided to sit.</li><li>Decor is really ugly and service was slow.</li><li>The decor is older, but I think it 's part of of the charm of this restaurant.</li><li>Keep the rest of the decor the same- it 's charming, and will contrast well with a new floor.</li><li>It is easy to believe that this place is 50 years old as much of the decor appear not to have been updated, ever.</li><li>I could stand the poor decor and service when the food was good.</li><li>The decor is not classy, I 'd say it 's very family-like.</li><li>The atmosphere and decor is similar to `` mom &amp; pop'' seafood places found in the Atlantic so do n't expect anything high-end.</li><li>Nothing special in the decor of the place either, but I do like coming back.</li><li>I like the lunchtime atmosphere a bit better as there is a lot of natural daylight and the decor is very clean and inviting.</li><li>The decor is quite modern.</li><li>I remembered they used to have a more traditional look with wooden furnitures but this time around the decor had become more modern and the menu was slightly altered.</li><li>Not a place to go for fancy decor or attentive service, but good if you want to grab a quick bite of authentic Korean food ( if you 've been to Korea: it 's like any of the millions of low-end diners around, which is n't a bad thing).</li><li>Really clean and nice decor.</li><li>Facility: Decor is outdated and space is very cramped.</li><li>It gets to the point, cuts out the overly indulgent decor, no wait staff, barely a table to dine-in, very small overhead costs.</li><li>Cool industrial decor.</li><li>The decor looks pretty new so they have either renovated recently, or have n't been in this location for long.</li><li>I guess you are paying for the dark decor ?</li><li>Their menu caters to most people 's palettes, the clean decor and decent service definitely helps in securing it as a `` safe'' restaurant to hold a gathering.</li><li>Pros: The decor of most Asian Legend restaurants are quite nice, with the nicest one being in Scarborough ( near Sheppard and Brimley).</li><li>I like the renovated decor which was done a few years ago.</li><li>Space is clean and the decor is nice.</li><li>By the way, the decor was very nice.</li><li>The furniture and decor feels quite new and is always clean, the washrooms are clean and high-tech ( touch-less soap dispensers, paper towel dispensers, as well as the bathroom doors which you do n't often see), and they added an outdoor patio fairly recently which is very nice in the summer.</li><li>Okay fine, the decor is as atrocious as everybody says, but I see no reason to dock stars when the food is so very excellent.</li><li>The decor was a little dated and outright weird to say the least.</li><li>Just enjoy the duck and do n't spend too much time looking around at the decor.</li><li>A lot of people dislike the decor of the restaurant.</li><li>In my opinion the decor is ugly &amp; needs an update.</li><li>Pros:- lots of parking- big portions- deilicious food- good for big groups, spacious Cons:- ugly decor- must specify no MSG- distracted waitstaff- washrooms cold &amp; need updating but clean.</li><li>However, as others have stated, the decor is very dated and odd.</li><li>I have been here quite a few times now, the food is reasonably good, the service if you dine in can be fairly slow and the atmosphere of the restaurant is n't t as relaxing as it could be due to the decor, like walking into a 70 's movie ..</li><li>When you walk in to the restaurant it 's like you 've travelled back in time as the decor is super dated.</li><li>The restaurant 's decor were dated.</li><li>Though the food has not changed in quality over the years, neither has the furnishings and decor.</li><li>My first impression was that I had stepped back into time and that I was in the type of restaurant with a decor right out of the 70 's.</li><li>A traditional Cantonese restaurant decor.</li><li>Unlike the decor, the food is ' updated' and their lunch special are delicious.</li><li>Being practically the only Chinese restaurant within a couple miles radius, management probably lack the incentive to improve on the quality of their food, never mind the decor.</li><li>The decor is gaudy and dated, with pink and other mismatched wallpaper, plants growing out of random places, a broken down mechanical ride at the entrance and a bar that 's never open.</li><li>The decor and set up definitely needs refreshing.</li><li>This is not somewhere you would go for fancy decor or a full bar anyways. came here today around 5pm, Food here is pretty good, everything tasted better than I thought.</li><li>I did n't give One star just because of the food, it 's the whole combination, the decor, service etc ...</li><li>Ya the decor has n't changed, dusty x- mas lights, mix matched wall papers, I did n't mind at all since the food was great! and with awesome service !!</li><li>The restaurant was the ugliest decor I have ever seen, the bathrooms were utterly filthy and the food cold and very unappetizing.</li><li>I 've been to this restaurant when I was still in elementary school and the decor has n't changed a bit.</li><li>If it 's lasted this long with this decor, you know the foods gotta be good!</li><li>I do n't have a problem with the pink walls, but I 'm not a fan of the east-meets-west decor.</li><li>The service is slow and the decor is delightfully/wildly tacky, but I seriously drive from Etobicoke to have the Shanghai fried noodles and General Tso Chicken.</li><li>However ..... the decor is HORRENDOUS. it 's pink, with plants growing everywhere.</li><li>Yes, I know this place has a decor that reminds me of a run-down Cuban restaurant.</li><li>The decor is dated but the food here is good.</li><li>Decor was really really old, signage was out of date and the staff was really rough around the edges.</li><li>The decor of the restaurant, was very chinese fusion buffet style, you got purple walls and random chinese/western/dated decor here and there.</li><li>The decor of the restaurant, was very chinese fusion buffet style, you got purple walls and random chinese/western/dated decor here and there.</li><li>Now I must discuss the decor.</li><li>The decor is open and modern, allowing for casual fast dining, but not so stark that I would n't stay for a few drinks after dinner.</li><li>I it 's authentic and the decor is a cross between romantic eat-in and retro fast food ...</li><li>The decor has that modern, futuristic style to it, and since it is quite new, everything is still spotless.</li><li>I really liked this place- awesome service, modern decor and yummy food.</li><li>The decor is great.</li><li>The decor was beautiful.</li><li>The decor was well done.</li><li>The decor is beautiful and staff are very friendly and willing to accommodate you.</li><li>Ambience &amp; decor: contemporary ( 3.5 stars) Food: mediocre, overpriced ( 2 stars), vegetarian unfriendly.</li><li>The decor was your standard Asian wooden decor and the cute little Korean ladies knew how to speak both Korean and Mandarin!</li><li>The decor was your standard Asian wooden decor and the cute little Korean ladies knew how to speak both Korean and Mandarin!</li><li>The decor is a bit outdated but it 's a very traditional Korean style.</li><li>Store kept clean, though decor is very simple.</li><li>McDonalds has improved its decor and menu over the years and I have visited this location a few times.</li><li>Another problem is the restaurant decor.</li><li>The decor is very dated, and the place a bit dirty and in desperate need of a makeover.</li><li>Nice atmosphere and minimalistic and clean decor.</li><li>The decor is minimal but gives a clean and welcoming feel.</li><li>It was a really comfortable spot with soft jazz in the background and really clean decor.</li><li>Good crepes, nice decor, a little bit pricy.</li><li>Decor: It 's so cute inside.</li><li>The decor is just really inviting to me.</li><li>Nice and clean, though the decor is confusing ( christmas garlands with nutcrackers and fake summer flowers ?) anyway, the service is great, the girl is always standing waiting to serve you, though she did n't understand my question when i asked what type of cakes they have.</li><li>And I am actually big on bathrooms and their cleanliness and decor.</li><li>One of, it not the cleanest restroom with nice and simple decor.</li><li>I spent the time admiring the modern decor ( still with Christmas decorations haha) and looked at the different cakes available ( some from Cheesecake factory!) behind their glass display.</li><li>This is a nice small Cafe with a cute decor though the Christmas decoration in the middle summer did throw me off.</li><li>The decor is really cute, simple and natural.</li><li>The decor in the place really rocks.</li><li>The decor is clean and bright!</li><li>So, the restaurant itself was clean and had a nice interior with simple decor.</li><li>Nothing upscale or fancy about the decor or service, but it 's the food that 's good.</li><li>It 's one of those places that look slightly sketchy and has little service, but the food is worth the lack of service and decor.</li><li>It is a typical Vietnamese restaurant, nothing fancy nor shiny and new looking but where they lack in decor and polish they more than make up for in quality of food.</li><li>This is n't a place for good customer service, beautiful decor, nor is it a place to seek for smiling faces.</li><li>I guess they have to charge a lot to pay for the decor.</li><li>The decor is dated, reminds me of some German house.</li><li>The interior is absolutely beautiful, with classy lighting and decor.</li><li>One thing that I observed, is that the restaurant has a more honest Japanese feel to it, not overly cluttered with cheap Dollarama Chinese turned Japanese type decor.</li><li>Decor is also not bad.</li><li>I would definitely come back for this dish again, reasonably priced around $ 20. after my last two trips to my former favourite sushi restaurant in the area, i 've confirmed that i need a new spot. two replacement orders `` on the house'' just does n't cut it when the fish is still slimy and greyish. decor is still nice though. maybe just stick to drinks or non-fish items ?</li><li>Portions reasonable, prices very reasonable, nice decor.</li><li>Ambiance: Great decor, but very typical `` Japanese'' style, with wood everywhere.</li><li>The shop itself has very basic decor and has a large `` Specials of the Day'' blackboard.</li><li>12 $ eggs benny Decor a little outdated and boring.</li><li>The decor is plain and comfortable, and the booth seats are a little too squishy.</li><li>Not impressed with the atmosphere or the decor, a bit dark on the inside, but we were starved and did n't care.</li><li>It was definitely a step above in decor.</li><li>Sooo, what I 'm saying is my food deserved a 3, the decor a 4, so in a perfect Yelp world, 3.5 stars.</li><li>The atmosphere in terms of decor and noise level like being at a mcdonalds but with sushi and servers.</li><li>In terms of decor and general ambience, the restaurant does n't provide you with anything particularly noteworthy.</li><li>This place has very casual and simple decor- it has a family-run style.</li><li>Do n't go for: a late night hang out spot with drinks or daily specials with nice decor, it 's all business here, you eat and then you leave cuz there 's a line up outside.</li><li>The decor inside was simplistic and was more than adequate.</li><li>The restaurant itself was very small and they must have had a very tiny budget for decor.</li><li>Come here for the food, not the decor or the parking.</li><li>Decor: From the exterior, looks not as nice as the downtown branch.</li><li>Decor is n't the greatest, but if your in to food mainly and just want something to warm you inside and out, this is the place.</li><li>Completely ruined our night ... whats worst is that we did n't even get an apology ... food is actually not that bad. the shrimp tempura was excellent. the waiting staff was atrocious. super slow and just brain dead. the only person who cleaned our table was the manager! the desert menu is very small. the also did not have a lot of the stuff that was advertised on the menu. i did like how they made the maki rolls with real japanese rice. we paid about $ 71 for two adults and a 4 year old, tips not included. the decor is pretty awful. the chairs were very ugly. it was very dark inside. we sat near the windows so that helped a bit in terms of lighting. i will never come here again.</li><li>The decor was heavy on dark wood giving the place the feel of a traditional Japanese ryokan.</li><li>The decor is old, the fabric on their seats shows its age in wear and tear and the tables are always a bit sticky."</li><li>The decor looks the same now as it did then.</li><li>The good:- Nice decor, cool seating where you likely have to sit with other parties around the cooking station.</li><li>The place looks essentially the same as it did over 10 years ago, but it 's not a bad thing as it has a kind of peaceful and quiet decor.</li><li>Fun, nice staff, nice decor.</li><li>Inside, the decor is very nice and classy, I enjoyed the mosaic and the ambiance was just lovely.</li><li>The only thing decent was the decor and waitress.</li><li>The decor was the only interesting thing I really liked about the restaurant.</li><li>I am fan of their decor and secretly wish I could swing on the swing like a kid when nobody 's watching.</li><li>What I do like about this place is the decor, the friendly and efficient service and the variety of food.</li><li>The decor is nice and well lit too.</li><li>The only reason for no 5 star is the outdated decor.</li><li>Classic orange decor designed by 1970s industrial psychologists, meant to get on your nerves shortly after you 've consumed your meal and force you out.</li><li>The restaurant itself is n't too visually appealing, but if you put decor to the side and focus on the food, then it 's great value.</li><li>Modern decor, good service, great food quality.</li><li>Decor is good.</li><li>These are characterized by generally reasonable prices, less than stellar decor, no attention on service, and minimal attempt at making the food look nice.</li><li>They have nice clean decor and ( relatively) attractive servers.</li><li>If I were in the area, I might not come back here, but instead go to Peking Man ( although the decor is not the best, the food is much better than this).</li><li>Food is good decor is okay.</li><li>The decor is spacious and more modern than most Asian restaurants ( which personally I like) 3.</li><li>So you 're not here for the decor.</li><li>Authentic Italian sandwich shop with simple, effective decor.</li><li>The decor has n't changed much at all since I visited years ago, newest addition from what I see is the flat screen TV.</li><li>Decor not the greatest and they have those vintage arcade games which I do n't think even work anymore but get takeout if you do n't appreciate the ambiance.</li><li>The decor can be put off some people, but this hole in the wall 's veal sandwich is definitely a great bang for your buck!</li><li>Remember you are paying $ 6.5 for a huge sandwich, its not gonna be the best veal sandwich in ur life, but it will fill u up positively, though u have to see thru the decor ......</li><li>I actually really enjoy the decor here and the service.</li><li>All the decor were black, brown, and dreadful.</li><li>Ill start off with some pros Pros: The decor and atmosphere is pretty nice.</li><li>The decor seemed a tad cheesy, with the fake Venetian murals and whatnot.</li><li>How is this place--with their overpriced menu, awful food, cheapy decor, and mediocre service--still in business ????</li><li>Considering our conversation kept getting interrupted as one of us would suddenly realize something else awesome &amp; comment-worthy about the decor ...</li><li>Really like the decor- it is luxurious compares to the scarlem location.</li><li>When I look at the place I think someone wanted to make a restaurant that looks like a Moxies, without spending the same budget on the decor.</li><li>Beautiful decor, immediately seated and prompt service.</li><li>Arriving one late snowy afternoon for lunch, I was surprised at the relaxed, dark wooden decor that would otherwise belong in a chic restaurant like Moxies or Milestones.</li><li>The decor is pretty cute though.</li><li>The decor was dusty and the restaurant was kinda dingy.</li><li>I went in not expecting a CHIC &amp; SIMPLE decor from a Sandwich place.</li><li>Decor is nil.</li><li>Decor: good.</li><li>Upon entering I could only notice the tacky decor and crap plastered along the walls.</li><li>Walking into this location I felt the decor was much more welcoming and suitable than its sister location at First Markham Place.</li><li>It is full of authentic decor in the restaurant, wooden booths and the flat Korean chopsticks.</li><li>Hae Mul Pa Jun ( Seafood pancake) Decor: Acceptable korean restaurant decor, not romantic.</li><li>Hae Mul Pa Jun ( Seafood pancake) Decor: Acceptable korean restaurant decor, not romantic.</li><li>This new location has an updated decor and much nicer feel.</li><li>Facility: Modern decor, clean washrooms, TVs on CP24 when we were there.</li><li>The place is very clean with modern decor and the bathrooms are clean too.</li><li>Very nice decor, modern and inviting.</li><li>Service was wonderful and the decor was very nice.</li><li>The decor is minimalist with a few Buddhist icons and statues.</li><li>Very satisfying. satay on the road has been one of my family 's favorite restaurants since i was a kid. i remember coming here when i was ten and ordering the same thing that i get now, ten years later: cashew nut chicken with an order of steamed rice and the shrimp chips with peanut sauce. first of all, the food tastes delicious. i think there 's been one or two times out of the hundreds of visits to this place where the food tasted a little spicier than usual but other than that, it 's been consistently amazing for close to a decade. i 've had cashew nut chicken at other thai restaurants and it just does n't compare. i ca n't speak about most of their other food but from what i 've experienced they 've been by far the best tasting thai restaurant in and around toronto. the wait staff is quick and friendly for the most part which is great. the atmosphere of the restaurant is nice ... they just re-did it and although i have to say i prefer the original decor which had an authentic thai feel to it, their modern, contemporary approach to their new `` look'' is very pleasing to the eyes and enjoyable to dine at as well. the value of the food is great. my girlfriend and i come here for their lunch special almost every week at least once and have a full meal with a drink that leaves us satisfied for both taste and hunger for usually under $ 10, 15% tip included. how can you beat that ? really. not to mention, you can order shrimp chips and peanut sauce as an appetizer while you wait for your meal, at no charge. i have yet to find another thai restaurant in toronto that has that. five stars to my favorite thai place since i was ten. i was happy to see that they expanded and opened another store on bayview. good for them!</li><li>The decor is fairly simple but nice and clean.</li><li>However the surly nature of th staff and the `` WOW, locked in the early eighties decor'' was a bit off putting.</li><li>The restaurant itself can use a good updating as the 1990 's decor is a little old.</li><li>Nice decor.</li><li>The decor is dated, the furniture looks like it came from a dorm room eating area, but the food is enjoyable and reasonably priced.</li><li>Do n't get turned off by it 's dated decor and cramped space, it 's some of the best sushi I 've had.</li><li>The decor is old and seems dirty.</li><li>I have never been to the restaurant so I ca n't content on their decor.</li><li>Stepping in, you can tell it 's one of those pretentious places w/ nice decor &amp; ambiance which simply means ... we look authentic &amp; can jack up prices &amp; even more so since it 's part of the Westin Prince Hotel.</li><li>A dark decor.</li><li>Katsura is an authentic Japanese restaurant with very classy decor, situated by the Westin Prince hotel which is a nice property.</li><li>Dean Martin playing on the speakers, lovely decor, spacious and clean.</li><li>While a part of me found it tacky, another part of me ( and my husband) kind of enjoyed the decor on the walls ( old looking Italian mural paintings- think Venus in a clamshell).</li><li>The atmosphere and decor are great here along with the service.</li><li>The decor such as the murals and different floral items arranged on the walls strongly added to the feeling of being a villa-like setting.</li><li>Great decor, good service BUT had better food: 1.</li><li>If you want a simple and causal but a place with nice decor, Symposium Cafe is where you go.</li><li>The decor and atmosphere is great.</li><li>It 'll take you 10 minutes tops.* 3-4am is the norm for Korean joints, and then there 's a couple 24/7 places.** They all seem to have the same shabby decor.</li><li>Decor of the place is very modern and chic.</li><li>This place is decorated with blue and white trendy decor, and since its in Bayview village this place is pricier than your typical Chinese restaurant.</li><li>Good lunch specials and really great decor!</li><li>Nice decor and excellent and attentive service.</li><li>The decor is average, but tidy and the cups are pretty cute.</li><li>Decor 4/5 Nice clean contemporary space.</li><li>It was n't bad but I wish it was as authentic and great as the decor.</li><li>The food was really good and nicely presented, the decor was really pretty and the bathrooms were clean.</li><li>Great decor, solid service and superb quality sushi.</li><li>It 's a very small place, the decor is welcoming and the staff very attentive.</li><li>First impressions were positive: nice layout and decor, slightly more intimate-feeling booth options, clean washrooms, and music at a reasonable volume.</li><li>Love the fries Wings are decent Prompt and kind service Nice decor Several televisions.</li><li>The decor is a little on the old side but since the ribs were so good I DEF AM COMING BACK !!</li><li>I do n't know how long this place has occupied their space, but from the decor, I have a feeling that this place used to be something else.</li><li>A good portion of the place is occupied by useless decor, like giant wall mounted sushi boats, and fake plants.</li><li>It 's fairly close to my house, it 's a nice sized restaurant with not bad decor.</li><li>Service was slow, it 's a pretty large venue, lots of lighting and red/gold decor.</li><li>I should have probably read the reviews on yelp before going to the restaurant .. but I did n't .. .. btw before i get started why is there filtered reviews ? maybe i missed something ..; anyways went here for lunch with a co-worker because its close to the office .. the decor is okay and we were quickly seated but thats as good as it got .. none of the staff make eye contact, everything is slow even tho the establishment was n't busy, there was just no importance on quality .. we ordered one of the lunch specials, the pricing is good, but I learned a long time ago, you get what you pay for, so for $ 7 to $ 15 you can get a salad, appetizer, sushi, chicken/beef, dessert, etc the food was cold and really average, they forgot our sushi and when we pointed it out to the manager he said he would take it off our bill .. a whole $ 1.20 ?? for 6 sushi rolls .. like i said u get what u pay for .. my co-worker, who is from hong kong blasted the manager, but he was no help ... so i will never go back .. but the experience got me back to using yelp!;).</li><li>The place is a little bit in need of an update; the decor is not bad or worn out, but the patterned carpet just makes it feel dated.</li><li>What a shame ..... and yes, the place was pretty empty ( Tuesday afternoon) This place needs to go back into its past &amp; rethink everything, what happened to that happy, light hearted atmosphere that was Wimpy 's ? ..... they went 99% of the distance with the decor .... but seriously, why unplug the Jukebox setup; really dumb- ( uh that kinda was the whole idea of having it there ....</li><li>When I first walked into this place, I was captivated by the jukebox and its decor.</li><li>The decor is somewhat dimlit but it adds to the ambience.</li><li>As if the main and upper floor isnt big enough already, they also have a basement- you really need to walk around and look at all the details and decor.</li><li>The decor remains elegant but seems increasingly dated- perhaps by 2050 it will revived as retro.</li><li>It 's like an old school mansion with very ornate decor.</li><li>Atmosphere: I honestly felt like I was trapped in a house with old decor and no windows.</li><li>The decor inside definitely has a European flair, it reminded me of some of the places I used to dine at out in the countryside in England.</li><li>It 's the type of spot that older people would love- very traditional- but the service, ambiance and decor make it a perfect date spot.</li><li>One of the best French decor in the city.</li><li>Not to put down any of the other reviews here, but this place is definitely overrated for the decor, service and $ $ $ $.</li><li>The decor is very grand.</li><li>Impressive decor.</li><li>And the ambiance and decor make it an interesting place to bring people who have never been.</li><li>Nice clean place with good decor.</li><li>I like the atmosphere because it 's bright and the tables and decor look modern.</li><li>The decor is slightly more modern compared to other Korean places.</li><li>The restaurant decor feels comfortable and nice to eat in.</li><li>My findings were as follows: Decor- Everything looks modern and clean.</li><li>The restaurant decor is nice and well-designed.</li><li>My favorite six grains and assorted fungus congee does not have as many of six grains as there are at Congee Queen, and I 'd rather pay few cents more for my extra grains:)) The decor is also a lot simpler and more generic and the seating arrangement is not the greatest with booths lining the sides and round tables put just in front of the entrance, so new customers literally stand over the eating patrons.</li><li>In terms of the decor, it needs more of an update.</li><li>It almost feels like you 're in a fast food restaurant but with nicer decor.</li><li>Although the decor got an update, the people and service have not changed.</li><li>Otherwise, the decor was blah, the ambience meh and service okay ...</li><li>I 've been to this bakery numerous times and when you first walk in you actually realize it is a Bakery/Restaurant which is sectioned off by a fish tank ( a bit odd) further to the back of the establishment. decor could use some work.</li><li>The quality of food was decent, I had a pasta dish that was pretty decent ( it was basil and had something else) It 's a weird set up though, a bakery/restaurant sectioned off by large salt water tanks ... that 's just weird and the decor could use a bit of an update.</li><li>The decor reminds me of an old rustic Italian Villa.</li><li>Went here for Summerlicious lunch- great atmosphere and decor.</li><li>Decor need a serious refresher.</li><li>Decor was dark and a bit dated.</li><li>The restaurant is small and the decor is not the best, but the food is always good and tasty.</li><li>Small Indian restaurant, with nice decor.</li><li>As I sit looking at the small but Ramen-esque decor of Ramen Specials on the walls and Introduction of Ramen origins.</li><li>Oh and the decor.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
