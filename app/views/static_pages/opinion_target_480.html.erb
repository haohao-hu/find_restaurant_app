<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 480' %><h2>pickled radish<br />occurrence: 10</h2><div><ol><li>Banchan ( side dishes) for the night were kimchi, pickled radish, kimchi radish cubes, bean sprouts, japchae, and broccoli.</li><li>My favorite wrap of the night ( self-made, of course) was lettuce ( duh), bite of rice, slice of garlic, piece of kimchi, slivers of pickled radish, and samgyupsal dipped in both sauces.</li><li>They also serve an appetitizer of pickled radish, lettuce and coleslaw.</li><li>Asked for refill for the side dish ( kimchi, pickled radish, bean sprout and some korean seed that I do n't know what it 's called).</li><li>I really did n't know what I was ordering but our server soon showed up with some familiar looking condiments- kimchi, pickled radish, bean sprouts, and some beans.</li><li>It also gets served with a side of purple rice cooked in a stone pot and 4 sides: bean sprouts, pickled radish, Kimchi and soy beans.</li><li>The waitress brought us the dish with a mountain of pickled radish, another waitress passed by and said ohh and took it back and returned with a smaller one.</li><li>The side dishes usually include kim chi, kelp/seaweed, pickled radish, potato, bean sprouts, soybeans, and japchae/glass noodles.</li><li>Complimentary side dishes are standard- kimchi, pickled radish, bean sprouts ... etc.</li><li>They have authentic okonomiyaki that they make fresh and serve on a sizzling platter with all the fixings. their gyoza is fresh and cooked to perfection. their takoyaki ( round pancake balls with a piece of octopus) is authentic and fresh too. less soup base options to ajisen, but if you find the equivalent here, you should find that it is less salty, less msg. being korean run, seeing any kimchi or pickled radish actually makes sense, and i think there is kalbi ( korean beef short ribs) on the menu as well. their service is not fast, and this place can be quite busy at times, but if you want ramen and you are not downtown on dundas or queen street, this is the best ramen you can get. i can vouch for the quality and consistency of this particular location, dunno about other Kenzo locations. i miss the tempura they used to have at this location, but it was taken off the menu. if you want an authentic bowl of ramen or okonomiyaki that is the closest thing to getting to Japan and having one there, this is the place if you are uptown.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
