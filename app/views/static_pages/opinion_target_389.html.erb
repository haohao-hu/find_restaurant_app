<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 389' %><h2>lunch special<br />occurrence: 10</h2><div><ol><li>I was there for the lunch special.</li><li>Ordered the cold noodle appetizer ( shown in pictures here), beef noodle soup ( lunch special), fried rice ( lunch special), mushroom and cucumber cold appetizer ( to balance out the heat from the the cold noodle appetizer).</li><li>Their lunch special is cheap.</li><li>As another reviewer mentioned, the lunch special ( which has always been the same chicken teriyaki and california roll every time I 've been), brings lunch in under $ 10 and definitely does the trick of filling you up.</li><li>The lunch special is very okay.</li><li>Unlike the decor, the food is ' updated' and their lunch special are delicious.</li><li>If you get there between 12pm-5pm on Tuesday to Fridays, you can get the lunch special including a drink and a crÃªpe for $ 10.99.</li><li>Pros: Has lunch specials and dinner specials, food came out quickly, tempura and japchae was yummy Cons: miso soup was too salty, the waitress sat me in a booth and did n't check up on me once the food came, did n't get a water refill, no banchan or kimchi, skimped on the Kalbi for the lunch special If you 're looking for a place in the area that serves Korean food for the same price, your best bet would be the Seoul house on Orfus Rd. You might said I 'm picky but I do n't think I would come back to this place.</li><li>Decided to go here because they have the lunch special till 4pm everyday.</li><li>The lunch special is enough food to last me 2-3 days of lunches at work.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
