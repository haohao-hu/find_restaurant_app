<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 1025' %><h2>lobster thermidor<br />occurrence: 4</h2><div><ol><li>The food was amazing, every single thing that we tried from the starter platter, the seafood soup, lobster thermidor ( we visited during the Lobster festival), the chocolate dessert were amazing.</li><li>The only thing that I did n't care for was the bread, you pay $ 3 for `` artisanal'' bread and it is 4 slices of room temperature bread, I was n't too thrilled about it, but I completely forgot about it when I ate my lobster Thermidor which is served with several types of mushrooms ( delicious) and pasta ( the pasta was n't great either, too much oregano, I recommend that you substitute this one).</li><li>Lobster Thermidor tasted very creamy, without much taste.</li><li>Their fish is horribly cooked- dry and tough- and their holiday specials ( e.g., lobster thermidor) are poorly done and not worth the hefty surcharge.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
