<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 400' %><h2>chairs<br />occurrence: 10</h2><div><ol><li>If you want pho I say go check out pho 88 on yonge near empress walk It was one of the first in the North York area to upgrade to the McCafé décor, with a dining area decked out with flat screen TVs and nice chairs.</li><li>It also has a nicer layout than most Starbucks, with a roomier service area large seating area that 's more secluded from the normal counter service and entry areas, yet still provides a nice ambience with cozy chairs right by the window.</li><li>Dirty restaurant with fruit flies and flies around our table, dirty Windows, our chairs were dirty.</li><li>The only complaint was that the backs of the chairs were sticky, which I attributed to old chairs with a worn paint stain in a humid environment ( it was hot and humid in Toronto that day).</li><li>They close at 10 and it was only 8:30 but the chairs were up on most of the tables ... not very welcoming.</li><li>The chairs were flipped upside down onto table so when the staff put chairs down to sit us, we got concerned and had to clean our own table and utensils.- waitress was VERY rude, she sat us on the inner end of a long table facing a wall where it wAs impossible for my friend to get in and out with people on the outer end.</li><li>Completely ruined our night ... whats worst is that we did n't even get an apology ... food is actually not that bad. the shrimp tempura was excellent. the waiting staff was atrocious. super slow and just brain dead. the only person who cleaned our table was the manager! the desert menu is very small. the also did not have a lot of the stuff that was advertised on the menu. i did like how they made the maki rolls with real japanese rice. we paid about $ 71 for two adults and a 4 year old, tips not included. the decor is pretty awful. the chairs were very ugly. it was very dark inside. we sat near the windows so that helped a bit in terms of lighting. i will never come here again.</li><li>Inside, tables and chairs are white, and several other people are eating.</li><li>The chairs are also hard and hurts my bum after 2 hours of sitting.</li><li>The chairs are comfy and very spacious.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
