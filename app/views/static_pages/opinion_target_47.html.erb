<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 47' %><h2>toppings<br />occurrence: 152</h2><div><ol><li>Same goes for the burgers on the Wendy 's side, make sure they gave you the toppings you asked for.</li><li>But a tear came to my eye when I saw the pizzas were perfectly cooked, all the toppings were correct, the two dipping sauces were nestled snugly against the cardboard corners in a strangely cute way, and it was just plain ol ' delicious pizza.</li><li>The diner is open 24/7 and despite the presence of some oddball customers if you visit in the middle of the night, you can always be sure you are greeted by people who appreciate your business, and that you 'll be having probably the best late night grub anywhere north of Bloor St. At just under $ 5, the shawarma served in Greek style pita bread is full of flavour and fresh toppings.</li><li>Delivery charge was $ 2.50 Great pizza with lots of fresh toppings to choose from.</li><li>The toppings were also plentiful and excellently prepared- tasty tofu, chicken, shrimp, onion, pepper and peanut.</li><li>They are what you would call FRESH and HEALTHY ( of course if you choose your toppings wisely).</li><li>Talise has sub type sandwiches with lots of toppings on them.</li><li>Just do n't put too much detail on your toppings, you will only be disappointed when you see that they forgot half of what you ordered.</li><li>Generally speaking, it works like so: you pick a `` base'', which is your choice of fried rice or fried noodles ( they have no problem with asking for half of each, which I usually do) and then you select a few other items they call `` toppings'', most of which are outlined below.</li><li>The number of toppings you get depends on which combo you select.</li><li>Here are the ones I remember: Combo 1: base + 3 toppings + soup = $ 4.84 Combo 2: base + 4 toppings + can of pop = $ 6.13 Kid 's combo: base + 1 topping ( in small container) = $ 3.16- all of their prices already include taxes- there are no items that count as 2 toppings by default- remember: CASH ONLY They offer up about 20 different toppings.</li><li>Here are the ones I remember: Combo 1: base + 3 toppings +

Mixed Vegetables Curry Chicken Fried Chicken Wings Fried Pork Chops Ma Po Bean Curd ( boiled tofu) Fried Bean Curd ( fried tofu) Spicy Vermicelli Noodle ( curry flavoured)*** Shanghai Fried Noodles*** Honey Garlic Pork Ribs Barbecued Chicken Chicken Balls Spring Rolls Egg Rolls*** = These noodles can be used as a base instead.</li><li>The Spicy Chicken, of which the place is so aptly named, was probably the worst of the 3 toppings I got.</li><li>The pizza was small and the toppings were weird.</li><li>My favourite part is the toppings.</li><li>Their burgers are moist, toppings abundant ( you get to pick them), combos save approx.</li><li>The only redeeming quality that they have n't lost is their wide and interesting selection of toppings ( wasabi mayo is my personal favourite).</li><li>They have interesting toppings which may not get the turn over that the usual suspects get and I am sure that something was off.</li><li>They have a good range of toppings to select from ( everything from mango chutney to guacamole).</li><li>Works like a Harvey 's where you place your order and then choose your toppings.</li><li>The toppings a unique but the bun soaks up all of the condiments adding to the dryness.</li><li>I mean, Pizza Nova is not the same even though the toppings are similar.</li><li>The pizza was okay but it was generally incohesive and the sauce and toppings were disheveled while the base was borderline frozen.</li><li>The salads are packed with great toppings and are totally worth getting.</li><li>The food:- Banchan: the are very generous with the appetizers here, the little spicy cucumbers and japchae are my favorite 4/5- Beef bone soup: dumplings/ rice cake/ egg white drop in a milky beef bone broth soup 4/5- Dolsot bibimbap: so many toppings!</li><li>Do n't understand how the religious people get the free deluxe toppings and the regular people are charged for them.</li><li>They cheese is generous as are the very fresh toppings.</li><li>The chicken itself has a pretty good flavor, but the wilted lettuce and sorry looking toppings always have me disappointed, and somehow there were fruit flies buzzing around all the veggies even though it 's- 4 degrees out ..</li><li>The were many sauces to choose from i opted for all of them and all the toppings.</li><li>Look to pay about $ 6 for a delicious chicken shawarma, complete with mostly fresh toppings ( the lettuce was slightly wilted and a little brown each time I went).</li><li>Get some hummus and hot sauce on those to assist the digestion of la chicken of Arabia with all the toppings my good sir!</li><li>The pita was soggy, the toppings were n't fresh- lettuce was wilted and very old looking.</li><li>The burger was pretty good for McDonalds, the bun and toppings were fresh and the burger itself had a good taste.</li><li>I would want more toppings and less shaved ice.</li><li>The shaved ice had tons of toppings such as corn flakes, strawberries, bananas, tapioca, and beans.</li><li>Once all the toppings were eaten, there was a lot of ice left.</li><li>Since Korean shaved ice is different from Taiwanese shaved ice, the toppings creates the entire flavour for the shaved ice.</li><li>The toppings included rice cakes, red bean and cornflakes.</li><li>Although after you 're done eating all the toppings, there is still quite a bit of ice left.</li><li>The portion was good for two people, but it could 've used more toppings.</li><li>However I felt the dish was only flavorful at the top where all the toppings were.</li><li>All their pizza is wood oven, and i 've tried traditional, milano, Calabrese and all their dough was nicely done, love the thin crust and they are generous on their toppings.</li><li>Perhaps most popular would be their pizzas, that come fresh out of the oven loaded with cheese and toppings.</li><li>The toppings are great ( try the eggplant!), the service is good, and you ca n't beat the price!</li><li>Pita 's are delieverd fresh each day ( ive seen the delivery guy many times) and the condiments and toppings are all uniquely fresh and delicious.</li><li>My only one unpleasant experience is when a lady served us the shawarma plate and she forgot to top the rice with some onions and garlic sauce, ( place was not busy, only one person dining in and one takeout customer) so I had to walk back from the car in the rain to kindly request for the toppings that add a gazillion notch to this dish, which she gladly did.</li><li>He told me he would start the falafel, which takes some time to cook, so that when we came in we could pick our toppings and be on on our way.</li><li>The same guy ( wish I 'd got his name) from the phone served us and was super friendly, and very generous with the toppings.</li><li>Frankly, I make better pizza at home and while it is not awful, it is certainly not worth the money and the toppings are not very plentiful.</li><li>So much character compared to Hero and they do n't charge an arm and leg for extra toppings ( except for cheese).</li><li>Great staff- they explain all the confusing burger choices and toppings for you.</li><li>We just got the regular burger with a pile high of additional toppings: mango chutney, guacamole, blue cheese, Cajun pepper etc ... You can tell this is gourmet when you can add chutney to your burger!</li><li>Burger was quite good and I liked the choice of toppings.</li><li>Love the vast selection of toppings ... makes up for the price of the food.</li><li>The unlimited amount of toppings you are able to put on your burger also helps and being able to have any topping as a side is a big plus.</li><li>Amazing veal sandwich for an affordable price, toppings coat extra but are worth it to get the best sandwich experience.</li><li>We ordered a veal sandwich with all the toppings and a spaghetti and meatballs.</li><li>All the toppings are hidden behind the counter so you do n't know if it is fresh.</li><li>They have tons of toppings to choose from and their quesadilla is actually very tasty.</li><li>When we asked the lady at the cash questions about the chicken shawarma she did n't explain to us and plainly pointed to the sign in front of the cash for the toppings and stuff.</li><li>Good amount of toppings, but I 'm not a big fan of fluffy crust, sweet pizza sauce, and slightly undercooked pizza ( I just made it sound worse than it was ...</li><li>They 're pizza has a thicker crust than I normally like but they have a wonderful assortment of toppings with a lot of unusual toppings ( for takeout pizza) like avocado and roasted corn.</li><li>They 're pizza has a thicker crust than I normally like but they have a wonderful assortment of toppings with a lot of unusual toppings ( for takeout pizza) like avocado and roasted corn.</li><li>The pepperoni and bacon are by far the best toppings you can get on pizza and they do n't skimp on the toppings here.</li><li>The pepperoni and bacon are by far the best toppings you can get on pizza and they do n't skimp on the toppings here.</li><li>And the toppings ?</li><li>The toppings were a little uneven, but there was a decent amount on the pizzas.</li><li>The other toppings were really good.</li><li>A large with 2 toppings is $ 15 including tax.</li><li>Do I get Yelp-branded bronze epaulettes ?) the falafel is fresh and the toppings are the best in the city .... great bargain How has no one Yelped King David yet ?</li><li>If you eat a lot of falafels downtown you 're probably used to a few pre-cooked falafel balls wrapped up in a paper thin pita with a measly amount of toppings and only a splash of sauce.</li><li>Since the dish I was going to try would have required each of those toppings, I decided to just turn around and leave.</li><li>Pulled meat ( not ground beef) inside the tortilla and the toppings added on top of it ( not inside).</li><li>I had the burger, no extra toppings ( cheese, bacon $ 1.29 each).</li><li>You can buy one or a dozen, and dress them up with various toppings.</li><li>The spaghetti cartoccio and risotto di mare are pretty good, and if you feel like pizza they have some very nice toppings to choose from.</li><li>I do not recommend the Schwarma sandwiches here ( they put very minimal toppings in the sandwiches) or going for the decor.</li><li>It 's one of my favourite Asian cuisine spots in the GTA. seriously, best congee not made by my mom LOL Really tasty, lots of toppings ( scallions, pork, thousand year old eggs) nom nom Empress Fried Rice ... dad loved it, I didnt try it.</li><li>I guess it depends on what toppings you add on but I find that cheese can make most things taste that much better. to be honest, I am not a ramen or any kind of instant noodle fan.</li><li>You basically get a pan of ramen which can be shared between 2-3 people depending how many other toppings you add.</li><li>Food is good but you need to add to order the additional toppings to make it really good.</li><li>- Chishan mian: Noodles in a spicy and sour broth with a generous amount of toppings.</li><li>However it was a bit greasy by my standard, and toppings were all cold while the noodles were only lukewarm.</li><li>The oilness overpowered all the taste of the noodles and toppings.</li><li>Especially love the little touches of sauce and toppings on the nigiri.</li><li>The serving was huge and again, very generous with the toppings.</li><li>Definitely the toppings ( also had sausage) complimented each other.</li><li>I could be wrong, but I think the toppings were in small bits.</li><li>The toppings were blanketed by cheese.</li><li>The supreme lover 's has fewer individual toppings than the super supreme, so I assumed that that would mean more of each individual topping.</li><li>My pick this time: Black sesame crepes ( 5/5): Nothing can beat their home-churned black sesame ice cream which is served with crunchy peanut toppings on a freshly made crepe wrapped around whipped cream and sponge cake.</li><li>They can also make substitutions if you do n't like something specific in your order ( i.e. toppings or ice cream).</li><li>The crepe had a nice vanilla flavour but the toppings are OK.</li><li>To score all five stars I 'd recommend them to use better quality sausage and more interesting condiments instead of your usual vinegary mustard and ketchup and also putting toppings on both halves of waffles would make it more delicious.</li><li>Not dry or crispy but perfectly soft and chewy filled with fresh toppings and cream.</li><li>It was pretty well sized with lots of toppings, pork blood, pork meat, beef meat, and vietnamese processed ham.</li><li>Overall, it was a nice noodle soup but nothing too spectacular as they seemed to have some meh toppings.</li><li>-Omelet w/ham 4/10 tasted microwaved, not many choices for toppings, could n't substitute the bun with something else- Chicken Noodle Soup 7/10 Average, tasted out of a can- Turkey Bacon Wrap 2/10 Horrible, if I was n't as hungry as I was I would of givien it 0/10.</li><li>They have a full omelette station set up, where you pick from many toppings to dress your eggs and the chef cooks it up to crispy to soft or running perfection- whatever is your egg fancy!</li><li>The cheese is a little crispy and so are the toppings.</li><li>I had the soppresatto and spicy salami and the crust was great but toppings didnt taste fresh at all.</li><li>I also had a vegetarian slice and the whole wheat crust tasted like cardboard and toppings werent fresh tasting ...</li><li>I got the meat lovers pizza, and it was fairly generous with the toppings.</li><li>Their ' deep dish' is just a very thick doughy crust with sparse, typical pizza toppings, resulting in a horribly unbalanced, dry, bready doughball.</li><li>The toppings were very fresh and tasty, you could actually taste the different flavors in the veggies!</li><li>The soup tastes average, toppings: poor, side dishes: average, service: not great, meh Is n't worth the money, not even eight bucks.</li><li>Then you pick your meat ( chicken, beef, pulled pork, pulled beef, fish and shrimp) and toppings ( four salsas, cheese, beans, sour cream, lettuce).</li><li>It 's assembly-line style ordering: type of tortitlla, type of meat ( I 've had pulled pork), toppings like veggies, cheese, guac ( EXTRA $ $), sour cream, and type of salsa ( warning: the hot IS hot).</li><li>The previous times before we had ordered pizzas and they came back 3/4 with wrong toppings.</li><li>Worker was in such a hurry he was so sloppy and skimpy putting on the toppings.</li><li>Both sandwiches were 4.99 each and with extra toppings and a drink came up to $ 14.</li><li>The quality of the veal meat and toppings is low to medium compared to somewhere like California Sandwiches but for the much cheaper price, it 's well worth it.</li><li>It is what it is you can compare to others but this like variety still in ingredients and toppings.</li><li>They charge up to $ 2.00 eachfor additional toppings like mushrooms, peppers and cheese.</li><li>It starts out at $ 7 but only gets higher when you start adding ( necessary) toppings like cheese and hot peppers.</li><li>For vegetarians, they have eggplant and I love the choice of toppings; along with the usual, they have rapini!</li><li>The toppings for the wraps are great.</li><li>We decided we could no longer call our order in for pick up, we had to make them watch it to ask for more toppings to be added if there was not enough put on.</li><li>On occasion there will be a decent amount of toppings added but it really depends on who makes it.</li><li>Another time we had the falafal balls and the side of tahini sauce was missing and another time a couple toppings were missing from our wrap.</li><li>They have lots of toppings, but for any of the non-standard toppings you need to pay extra so it 's not really worth it.</li><li>They have lots of toppings, but for any of the non-standard toppings you need to pay extra so it 's not really worth it.</li><li>It is expensive because of adding toppings and special things like mushrooms or special sauces.</li><li>I 'm not a burger aficionado, but I do appreciate good toppings.</li><li>The staff seem very eager to please- they gave me extra premium toppings due to a slight mix-up ... so now I 'm a big fan of the smoked cheddar cheese.</li><li>It 's got a better choice of toppings than a Harvey 's and they also take their time in preparing the meal.</li><li>Plus you can get a large with unlimited toppings for a cheap price and not have to live across the border like Pizza Hut 's any size pizza, any toppings for $ 10.</li><li>We ALWAYS get the walk-in special which is one large pizza with extra tomato sauce with 2 toppings for $ 9.99 and a garlic sauce on the side for a buck extra.</li><li>We ordered the usual and had pepperoni and green peppers for our 2 toppings.</li><li>Food is good and toppings are fresh.</li><li>Wide assortment of toppings such as lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, pickles, cucumbers, black olives, jalapenos, hot peppers and tons of sauces to choose from.</li><li>Pros: Toasted bun, good grill flavor, generous portions of basic selection of toppings, large portion.</li><li>Honestly ... one of the better burger places in Toronto .... Nothing too great ... but the 6 oz homemade burger is heavy and fills you up and they make their toppings great ... I have paid double for a burger that just tastes like cardboard .... so for that alone ... i will salute the Burger Hut for making a savoury burger when i really crave one.</li><li>After a short discussion she came back saying that we were restricted to only a few choices such as the Canadian pizza; basically just the few specialty pizzas with the least amount of toppings.</li><li>They cheaped out on the toppings and my chicken and hamm pizza only had a few pieces on chicken where only 2 slices and 2 small pieces of chicken on it. for the price, i could have gotten more and better pizza somewhere else.</li><li>The French toast portion was huge; it came with 3 slices of toast ( all cut in half), with a very generous amount of Oreo toppings, and Chantilly cream ( on the side), two slices of bacon ( or you can choose ham instead), and a nice bowl of fruits.</li><li>The toppings for the burger were generous.</li><li>This one is a fun spot for a group, or for a laid-back family birthday, with the chocolate fountain and philipino-style shaved ice machine featuring fun syrups and toppings, both always a big hit.</li><li>Recommend the chicken wings, custard buns; for dessert, try their coconut taro with red bean and almond tofu and juice bomb toppings; make-it-yourself slushie station is popular amongst kids although adults like myself were tempted to help ourselves to a serving as well Chocolate fountain is quite impressive but more selection of fruits that are less sweet would be a nice touch-strawberries and banana for example Overall good experience-would come again I really dig this place when I 'm in the mood to stuff my face with various types of protein.</li><li>Desserts are quite varied; they include a shaved ice machine with a variety of toppings, and a chocolate fountain.</li><li>The Indian-style chicken they have as toppings is leagues better than Agra 's meat at about a third of the price.</li><li>I ordered the King of Kings ( Netsu ramen with 5 extra toppings) and it was just as good as the ones I have had in the downtown locations.</li><li>I ordered the Orochong Ramen ( Soy sauce flavoured spicy ramen with chicken and vegetable toppings).</li><li>The toppings are typical toppings that you would n't see at a Subway or Mr.Sub, however, their food still has a homemade feel and does n't taste `` commercial''.</li><li>The regular submarines are foot longs, and are always packed with meat and your choice of toppings.</li><li>Not a bad price considering your getting a foot long submarine that is jam packed with your desired toppings, and you pay the same for your typical Quiznos regular sub which has hardly any meat in it compared to Bellys.</li><li>I also love the fresh toppings, especially the finely shredded lettuce ( remember whn McDonalds did this ?</li><li>At Belly Buster 's the buns are soft, white or whole wheat, and the toppings are simple- except for the famous `` Belly Buster'' which has gravy.</li><li>The only thing that would make this a 5 star would be if they got more interesting toppings.</li><li>Also what is so great are the toppings.</li><li>Just ask for whatever you want because some toppings are hidden due to space, so do n't be shy. can you tell i love this place ? lol I 've got three basic rules that have made me the singular successful guy I am and have kept me in the running to be a Darwinian success.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
