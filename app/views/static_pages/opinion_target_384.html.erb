<% provide :title, 'Opinion Target 384' %><h2>mozzarella cheese<br />occurrence: 13</h2><div><ol><li>Philly Shawarma Pizza- Beef Shawarma, peppers and onions, topped with melted mozzarella cheese.</li><li>I dropped in today for lunch and had a good veal parmigiana sandwich and a drink for $ 8.50 taxes in .... the veal was hot, the bun was fresh, the mozzarella cheese was plentiful and stringy ... mushrooms and peppers were good but could have used a few more to make it perfect.</li><li>Ordered: Dak-Gal-Bee ( JS-1) 4/5* Chicken ( boneless dark meat) and assorted vegetables ( cabbage, sweet potato and greeon onion)* Choose your spiciness ( we went with B. The Joons Original Spicy Sauce)* $ 9.25 per portion ( 2 portions minimum), we ordered 3 portions for 3 people* Extra Add On: rice cake, mozzarella cheese, instant noodle, vegetables and fried rice* Extra add ons are all $ 2 except the fried rice* Everything is thrown together and comes to your table uncooked* Because it 's chicken, they take a while to fully cook and it drives you crazy* Servers will come around and cook them for you so do n't worry about the process* If you order mozarella cheese, they come midway and add it on near the end* For 3 portion order, I found there were n't much chicken* Original spicy sauce is not spicy at all !!</li><li>You have to pay $ 2.00 extra for each topping you want added ( ie. rice cake, mozzarella cheese, rice, noodles).</li><li>Interesting and yummy.:) but I do n't know how authentic it is to mix instant noodles with chicken or another protein and then top it with mozzarella cheese.</li><li>I came to Joon 's again and ordered the DakGalBee for dinner with rice cakes, mozzarella cheese, and noodles, but this time with the original Joon 's spicy sauce.</li><li>We were a party of four, so we got two portions of the seafood and chicken versions, topped with their original sauce, mozzarella cheese, and rice cakes.</li><li>You also have to pay $ 2.00 for each add-on, with options such as: rice cakes, mozzarella cheese, and ramen noodles, which are all MUST HAVES in my opinion.</li><li>We had to have it with ramen noodles and mozzarella cheese.</li><li>Had 3 portions of the seafood dakgalbee with Joons sauce ( B) and mozzarella cheese and ramen.</li><li>I always get it with the regular level spicy ( + rice cakes, noodles and mozzarella cheese) I would recommend asking them to put less vegetables ( they always put a lot and less chicken).</li><li>Extra add-ons include rice cakes, sweet potato, and mozzarella cheese ( a must get!).</li><li>There were lots of mushrooms and mozzarella cheese and spinach in the portobello mushroom crepe, and the flavors blend very well.</li></ol></div><ul class="pager">
